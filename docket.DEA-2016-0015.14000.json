I use kratom daily for the treatment of depression, bi-polar disorder, and PTSD.  I would be devastated by restrictions on its sale, possession or use.\n\nI am currently disabled.  I receive Social Security benefits.  I take psychiatric medicine, which works to the extent that I am not homeless, incarcerated, or dead.  My daily life is still severely affected by these problems; before discovering kratom, I could not even take care of my personal hygiene.  I spent most days in a depressed fog in which nothing mattered to me.\n\nKratom has greatly improved my quality of life since I began taking it several months ago.  I feel happiness and contentment, emotions which have eluded me for decades.  Kratom gives me the energy and willpower to take care of myself.  I have never experienced any negative side-effects from taking kratom.\n\nI am concerned about kratom's legal status for personal reasons, but also because I believe government overreach in areas of personal liberty are troubling.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nGreg M.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7544","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Greg M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nI hadn't previously heard of kratom, but if it aids people to kick addiction to opiates I believe it is a good thing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19420","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diana Saxon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please withdraw this scheduling request immediately!

The left side of my body impacted the car, my skull cracked on the hood of the car and my left temporal skull bone was fractured severely. I sustained traumatic injuries in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage,  hip, femur, and knee. My body then fell off of the car and impacted the concrete road, seriously injuring my right side, especially my right hip. I sustained multiple abrasions, lacerations, and bone fractures throughout my body. I would later wake up in the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) at the regional hospital in my state, approximately nine hours after I was struck by the car. \n\nI had extreme cognitive deficits and was having great difficulty with my short and long term memory, I also developed Broca's Aphasia. This type of Aphasia is a neurological disease that affected my speech, language, and communication abilities, all of which are primarily enabled by the left temporal lobe of the brain. My left temporal lobe was compressed by the inward pressure of the collapsed bone fragments from my depressed skull fracture. My skull's bone fragments came within one millimeter of lacerating a major artery in my brain, which would have almost certainly killed me through hemorrhaging. I spent the next year recovering from my body's injuries and my traumatic brain injury. It took me three months to be able to walk again with the assistance of a walker, then weeks later I could walk with a cane, then unassisted. I spent many months in neurological, physical, speech, and occupational therapy. \n\nTwo years after my trauma and brain injury I was almost fully recovered and had overcome my Broca's Aphasia. I've always suffered from severe persistent asthma however, and in the Fall two years post-injury I was admitted into my local hospital's emergency department for a severe asthma exacerbation related to a bout of bronchitis I developed. My asthma attack took several weeks to recover from and I was prescribed heavy doses of both oral and intravenous corticosteroids to treat my lung tissue and airway inflammation. I was ordered to stay on corticosteroids for many months. \n\nUnfortunately, a major side effect of the corticosteroids I was given is Avascular Necrosis, which for me, was the vascular occlusion of my left and right femoral heads, the round bone \"ball\" extension of the upper femur that fits into the \"socket\" of the pelvic acetabulum. Blood supply was cut off to both my left and right femoral heads over the course of several months from corticosteroids to treat my asthma and inflammation. This lack of blood and oxygen resulted in my left and right femoral head bones dying, they became severely necrotic in their cores. \n\nEventually after living with severe chronic pain for yet another year, my right femoral head fractured and collapsed in on itself while I was walking in my home. I then had to wait another two months with a collapsed femoral head and a nearly collapsed, hollow, necrosed left femoral head. My entire existence became defined by severe, unrelenting, chronic pain. I was finally able to get a right-side total hip replacement, which was a success and replaced my necrosed right femoral head, femoral neck, and upper femur with a titanium and ceramic composite prosthesis.\n\nAfter going through more than three years of extreme chronic pain, traumatic brain injury recovery, neurological comorbidities, sequelae, asthma, and many dozens of hospital and rehabilitation center stays and visits, I finally knew what I wanted to do with my life. I decided to become a registered nurse, as the RN's that took care of me so compassionately throughout my many injuries and recovery periods had a profound impact on me. However, even after my hip replacement my left femoral head was still partially necrosed and my right femoral nerve was damaged in the surgery. I still suffered from severe chronic pain of musculoskeletal and neuropathic varieties. Over the past several years my daily chronic pain levels, on a scale of 1-10, have averaged from 6 to 9 out of 10.\n\nTo treat my extreme chronic pain I was prescribed numerous opioid medications. My pain levels continued to be debilitating and made both my daily routine and progress in nursing school very difficult. The opioids also caused extreme side effects and would have killed me from intestinal blockage if I continued to take them. I then found Kratom and finally found relief in this plant, my pain went down to 2-3 out of 10 and my life improved substantially. I have used Kratom for many years now and have never had side effects. I rely on Kratom for my chronic pain control, nothing else works, if it were made illegal my life would become a tortuous, burdensome existence again. This plant is a miracle for me, my life will be negatively changed by a Kratom ban, thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16544","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This is an important supplement.

If you're looking to make the opioid epidemic in this country far worse, scheduling kratom is the way to do it.\n\nMy boyfriend has struggles with anxiety and depression his entire life, and due to being caught in a fire, has also struggled with painkiller abuse.  Kratom alone eases both opioid cravings and his depression without having any negative or behavioral side effect.  I am very judgmental and conservative when it comes to drug use and abuse, and even I can see how this plant has helped him immensely.  He is a better person to be around and live with because of it.  Honestly, he's probably alive because of it.\n\nI suffer from intractable migraines a couple times a month.  Aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, I've tried it all.  I am NOT interested in prescription medication that can be abused and have unwanted side effects.  When I get these migraines, a tiny big of kratom (about 2 gel capsules full) is all it takes to cure it.  It's really an incredible substance, and should be studied for its mood stabilizing and pain relieving abilities.  NOT scheduled and stigmatized.

For the last 10 years, I have had non-stop / 24 hours a day headaches similar to having the flu.  The condition includes pain in my ears and tinnitus.  Arthritis in my shoulders.  Sleeping is extremely difficult. I have fibromyalgia. I am sensitive to light and sound. I have seen 30+ doctors (neurologists, rheumatologist, ent, sleep docs, primary care, urgent care, long term pain management). I have spent 2 weeks in the hospital getting IV drugs, nerve blockers, and anti-seizure drugs. I have taken over 100 drugs to treat my condition with no success. \n\nAfter years of trying alternative therapies including meditation, yoga and exercise, I have found the only thing that gives me relief from the constant pain is some form of Oxycontin or Kratom.  So, the choice is to become a addicted to the most addictive pill on the market or use Kratom.  Kratom is inexpensive and doesn't appear to be addictive for me (i.e., my dosage has not increased in a year of using it).  I am terrified that the DEA will make it illegal because then my options look pretty awful (i.e., become addicted to a drug or suffer in agonizing pain).\n\nDue to this disease, I went from being a successful Vice President of several companies driving range rovers and Mercedes Benz convertibles to laying in a darkened room petting my dogs belly for comfort. Before Kratom,  I was in such horrible pain that I contemplated suicide often.  Doctors do not like to prescribe Oxycontin for me because of fear of addiction.  Additionally, in this climate, DEA has scared doctors so much that they are unwilling to risk punishment by the DEA. The DEA has, in effect, made it extremely difficult for me to get any medical relief treatment for my pain. I wish it was possible to somehow have Doctors or the DEA feel my pain for a year, without a doubt, they would change their minds. \n\nI was diagnosed with New Daily Persistent Headaches (NDPH) about 6 years ago. I was so happy to get a diagnosis that I didnt realize until later that all this meant was that there are other people who suffer similarly but no one knows what causes it. The only thing doctors do know is that there is no treatment (I.e., it is refractory). \n\nIn the last year, I started looking into Lyme and co-infections. I was tested over the years for Lyme but the tests came back negative. I didnt find out until about 6 months ago that the tests for Lyme are only about 70% accurate. So, it is possible that I have been suffering for the last 10 years and it could have been treated. At some point, shouldnt the medical community take responsibility and at a minimum treat me for pain? Instead, medical insurance doesnt cover treatment for Lyme disease and it is over $1100 for the first 2 doctors visits. \n\nIn June 2016, a Lyme disease clinic found that I have Lyme disease, walking pneumonia, rocky mountain fever and babesia.  I am currently on 2 IV antibiotics and 4 oral antibiotics.  These are all treatable but will probably be over a year of heavy medication.  Additionally,  it has done so much damage to me in the last 10 years that even if the antibiotics eradicate the disease from my body, I could still suffer for the rest of my life.  A brain scan identified damage to both the white and gray matter in my brain.  \n\nKratom is a god send. It is very effective in treating my pain. Please do not make it illegal.  Making Kratom illegal without any alternative treatment will subject me to a least another year of intolerable pain.  If the pain doesn't leave when the Lyme disease and coinfections are treated, I could face a lifetime of pain without any relief.  Please should me mercy.\n\nThank you,\nRobert Herman\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6095","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-20T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Herman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Keaton has been amazing for me with no side effects that I notice.

I have personally witnessed the positive effects of Kratom on my husband, Ryan. He is 35 and had an accident injuring his back about 10 years ago. His doctor prescribed him several painkillers and he got to the point where he was eating them like candy. About a year ago, Ryan's doctor became under investigation, and was no longer allowed to practice, for prescribing an excessive amount of painkillers and several other factors. Ryan and I tried to find a new doctor for him but no one would give him the prescriptions he had taken for many years. Ryan did not think he had became dependant on these drugs but when he got severely ill and started having major withdrawals, it was very scary to our family. I became so desperate to help him, i took him to the methadone clinic. A place i never thought he or I would ever step foot in. It was disgusting to me and he was embarassed to have to stoop that low. The people there do not want to help you to become clean, they want to keep you using their product, and talk down to you when you try to reduce your dose. After about a month of this, Ryan decided to do all the research he could into other options to help him. That's when he came across an article on Kratom. He told me about it and was very excited, but I was very skeptical and thinking this is going to be a waste of money. But at this point I was desperate to try anything to help him. He ordered a small amount online and the day it came in the mail, he drank some and did not go to the clinic. He has never went back since. Ryan has not had a pain pill since and is now totally against them. He had his wisdom teeth pulled and refused when the dentist tried to give him a prescription. Ryan will occasionally drink some Kratom if hes having back pain but he no longer takes it daily. I believe Kratom saved his life. It helped him to overcome his addiction and helped him to get his life back, with no side effects or habit forming effects. I believe Kratom should be easily available to families who have nowhere else to turn in a situation like ours. If it weren't for Ryan stumbling across Kratom by accident, i do not know what would have happened. Now we have our normal lives back and he is free from addiction. Please allow Kratom to help others the way it has helped us. I have also tried Kratom because i have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It has helped me to feel less anxious and improved my mood. I believe Kratom can be helpful to many people and should not be considered a controlled substance. I have nothing but positive things to say about Kratom and it doesn't have that \"high\" effect that most painkillers do. It just helps us to live our normal lives without being addicted or feeling the need to have some everyday. \n\n\nSincerely,\nSara Horn","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2389","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sara Horn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\nMy name is Bill McWhorter.

Kratom is a herbal supplement made from the crushed leaves of the kratom tree, an evergreen native to the tropics of Southeast Asia in the coffee family. The leaves can be brewed into a tea, which after ingested can provide relief from pain and anxiety. Kratom has been used medicinally, safely, for thousands of years. \n\nIn the midst of epidemic opiod abuse in the United States, for the DEA to spend the resources on passing and enforcing a ban on kratom, I feel is a misuse of federal resources. Not only is kratom not an opiate, but it actually assists opiate addicts through withdrawal and staves off craving. The timing could not be worse to deny Americans a solution to opiod addiction. According to the CDC, in 2014 alone, there were more deaths caused by opioids than ever before in our history, with approximately 78 people dying per day. Source: https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/\n\nBanning kratom would also make it very difficult to do any clinical research on the medicinal properties of the herb because researchers would be required to obtain a license from the DEA and meet its stringent requirements. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kratom-drug-ban-may-cripple-promising-painkiller-research/ Kratom is an herb that could have important implications for pain relief, anxiety, depression, PTSD and stopping opioid dependence. Kratom offers these painkilling and antidepressant effects but has less side effects such as respiratory depression which is the leading cause of death in opiod overdose. It should be available to Americans and researchers as is any other benign herbal supplement.\n\nKratom allows millions of Americans to function at a level they would not be otherwise able to due to chronic illness and anxiety. It is not good public policy to ban kratom and deny people the ability to use it, therefore significantly reducing their quality of life and increasing the probability of disability, drug abuse, and suicide. \n\nMy personal story:\n\nI am a 36 year old disabled woman. I am housebound and mostly bedbound due to illness. I am immunocompromised and am battling chlamydia pneumonia, Epstein Barr, HHV6, chronic influenza A and B, Bartonella, Babesia, Lyme Disease, mold toxicity, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Kratom allows me to have a quality of life. \n\nI found Kratom while desperately seeking pain control in 2014. At the time I could not walk unassisted, I was 95lbs, and in incredible pain. I began taking Kratom after experiencing pain so intense it landed me in the hospital for 6 days. I am unable to take pharmaceutical pain medications due to severe adverse reactions in each class of drugs. \n\nI researched intensely before deciding to use kratom. I hold a Masters degree and two undergraduate degrees. I am familiar with ethnobotanical research. I weighed the benefits and risks after reading about the medicinal uses of the herb. I believed and still believe that kratom is the least of all evils at my disposal and is actually of benefit to me.\n\nI prefer kratom because there is no high associated with it. It's addictive properties are minimal. I have never had an issue stopping my usage or taking varying dosages. There are no cravings and withdrawal symptoms are less than that of caffeine dependency.\n\nKratom has relieved my pain and helped my mental illness symptoms for more than two years. When the pain from my diseases made me suicidal, I turned to Kratom. When I couldn't sleep because of my suffering, I turned to Kratom. When the PTSD from the medical trauma I endured left me curled in a ball unable to move or speak, Kratom was there. When medical science could not ease my pain, there was Kratom- an ever faithful friend holding my hand through the darkest times I have ever known.\n\nWhat this ban would mean for me is the end of life as I know it. I am afraid of how much I will regress without the herb that has carried me through my darkest days. I am afraid to go back on prescription medications and experience side effects that render me completely disabled and zombie-like. I deserve a quality of life. I am not hurting anyone with my use of Kratom, least of all myself. \n\nThe DEA should abandon the effort to ban kratom and encourage the public, researchers, scientists, medical community, addiction treatment providers, and any other relevant groups to analyze and contribute to existing kratom clinical research.  Kratom is an herbal supplement with great potential and should not be kept from the people who can find relief and a better quality of life from its use.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0668","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Denise Hartley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\n\nPlease do not make this plant illegal.

I myself have taken kratom to help the symptoms of mild to moderate depression, and as an occasional, non-addictive sleep-aid. The benefits of kratom for easing the symptoms of depression are, in my experience, almost exactly like St. John's Wort or Valerian root, but without unwanted side effects such as sensitivity to light or a dizzy, \"hung-over\" feeling the next day that both of the aforementioned FDA-approved supplements have caused. \n\nI have never found kratom to be addictive in any traditional sense of the word; going without kratom \"cold turkey\" after taking a moderate-sized dosage of 5-6 grams once or twice a day for several weeks resulted only in a mild headache and slight irritability for two days, exactly like quitting caffeine in the same way. \n\nI consider the idea that kratom should be subject to emergency scheduling as something ridiculous, especially in light of already-approved substances such as alcohol which are both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of many Americans every year.\n\nAs a simple dietary supplement, I consider kratom not to be a necessity at all, but certainly a boon that makes being a productive member of society easier for myself and for others. With adequate testing and vetting in the way that other dietary supplements have been processed, I have confidence that kratom can and will be a safe and healthy tool that will help many Americans to pursue happiness and well-being, as is their collective, inalienable right.

I am 53 years old. I am an RN as well as a certified public health nurse for the state of California .\n I am very opposed to the DEA placing Kratom on the list of schedule one controlled substances.   I started using Kratom  three years ago to help control chronic pain .   I came to use it after being on opioid narcotics prescribed by physicians for three years.   I eventually quit the opioid narcotics due to their high addiction potential,  and increasing tolerance.   The crate him not only helped me quit taking the opioid (Easing withdrawals),  but also helped me and replacing the opiods.\n They are certainly not as strong  as the prescribed hydrocodone, but taken together with ibuprofen allow me to function in society .   Without Kratom,  my choices would be to go back on narcotic opioids,  or to go on disability.\nAs an RN,  I can see the potential benefit of this herb in helping millions of people  to get off of synthetic narcotics.   Millions of people are dying from overdoses related  to opioids  such as Fentanyl.  \n By keeping this herb legal,  you are saving lives, inspiring hope,  and helping to reduce crime associated with street narcotics.\n If you are  working at the DEA and you truly believe in helping people, then you need to do the right thing.   As a health professional, I will continue to support Kratom.\n Personally, I feel that marijuana is a much more dangerous drug.   I am quite sure that the pharmaceutical industry does not want this herb kept legal.  \n\nAs a  Health professional, I can claim that this herb  has improved my immune system, and general health. I have lab results to back up this claim.   Additionally, I have seen many former narcotic addicts who are now able to live without their prescribed narcotics and who are now  functioning members of society.  \nIn the words of Dr. Christopher McCurdy, head researcher at the University of Mississippi (where kratom has most recently been studied in the U.S.): Based on the information available in the scientific literature, we know that Kratom has been utilized for centuries by people in Thailand, without stigma associated with its use. In traditional medicine, Kratom has been used as an antidiarrheal and as a treatment for opioid dependence. Although there are suggestions that Kratom has a risk of addiction, there is no solid scientific evidence available to support or refute this idea.    \nKratom is safely improving the health and well-being of adults all across America. I support further scientific study of the plant, regulations like age restrictions, and oppose legislation or action by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to make it a schedule 1 controlled substance that will turn hundreds of thousands of responsible kratom consumers into criminals, and cut off promising ongoing research into its many benefits.\n\n If you personally know or are one of the millions of people dealing with chronic pain then please do the right thing for them.  \n \n\nSincerely,\n Susan Farmer RN BSN PHN (CA)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2919","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan Farmer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is James Barnes and I work at Union Hall Cafeteria. If Kratom became scheduled at all it would punish injured war veterans that need pain management that would rather use an herb then powerful pharmaceutical pain killers that are really addictive such as hydrocodone or Oxycodone. There is an opiate epidemic in America right now. Kratom helps addicts quit opiates and alcohol. I started using Kratom almost two years ago. I read a lot of good things on Kratom on the internet and decided to try it for myself. I used to be on strong medications like Adderall and benzodiazepines. I have been diagnosed ADHD and with anxiety. Using Kratom I have quit my medications under the guidance of my doctor. Kratom helps me focus like Adderall without all the nasty side effects of Adderall, and it helps me with anxiety at the same time. Kratom is A miracle herb for me. Kratom should remain legal because there are no recorded deaths of Kratom use without other substances involved. Tobacco kills hundreds of thousands of America s every year and it stays legal. If tobacco is legal Kratom should definitely be legal and available. Please keep Kratom legal and available. Kratom benefits millions of Americans that have pain management problems, Kratom helps people quit hard addictions, and it helps people with ADHD and Anxiety. If Kratom becomes illegal it will have negative effects on American society, and whole lot people myself included will be forced to go back on stronger nastier pharmaceutical drugs that have more side effects and addiction potential then Kratom has if Kratom doesn't stay legal and available.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1403","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Barnes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life from opiate addiction and Xanax addition.

In 2016 a piece of ruptured disc, broke off and dried out, then got lodged against my sciatic nerve.  During the 2 month period prior to when I could get the surgery, I was in pain from the moment I woke up, to when I went to sleep.  My only other relief was when I could position my back in a chair with a straight enough back. Lying in bed was worse, and walking resulted in pain every step.  While several doctors offered prescriptions for opioids, I did not want to be using them for 2 months and then post surgery.  During this time, I chose to use Kratom instead.  I found the Kratom would take the edge off my pain, enough so I could move around and function. \nPost surgery, I am using turmeric which helps along with Kratom.  I have residual pain in my lower back due to degeneration of the discs, arthritis and the like.  These things have allowed me to continue without prescription opioids. \n\nFor myself, Kratom has no more of a psychological effect than my morning coffee, and I use it regularly.  If I discontinue for a period of time, I don't notice it unless I get a \"report\" from my lower back. There are no withdrawals or any compulsion to use it.   I cannot imagine how this would be used for recreational use.  From what I have read, it is cheaper to buy opiates on the street.  If you take too much, there is no additional affect, it simply makes one spontaneously vomit.  \n\nThese comments are based on my personal experience.  Scientific research might help in determining addiction potential, side effects, and other potential useful information for pain relief.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2847","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bernie Bober","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19333","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Nelson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am not a Kratom user, but I have known first and second hand of many individuals who have kicked other drug addictions by replacing it with Kratom, then have been able to stop Kratom as well.

After 15 years of being shuffled from doctor to doctor and being made to feel like a guinea pig because of the easily over 40 drugs that they tried on me, being told I was in such bad condition that I was \"untreatable\", having serious allergic reactions to many of those prescription drugs they made me try....the last doctors gave up and told me I would just have to live on heavy narcotic pain pills for the rest of my life. After living on oxycontin and percocet for a few years, not only do they not work as well any more but you are forced into a drug dependency. If my doctor took a vacation, I was thrown into severe withdrawal symptoms just like I was some sort of heroin addict, because you can't fill these type of prescriptions even a day early. This was no way to live. I hated the pills and I hated the dependency so I started researching safe, natural alternatives. This is when I found kratom. I researched it for over a year before getting the nerve to try it. I joined several groups on Facebook just to see how actual users of kratom liked it and if it helped with pain.  I was easily able to break the physical addiction to the narcotic pain medications with kratom and have used it for over a year and a half now. I still use the prescription pain meds but only a few times a month due to severe pain...but besides that, I take kratom for my pain every day. I really like the fact that it does not give you a \"high\" feeling like the prescriptions did! You only feel a slight calming or slight energy boost (depending on type you take) while it takes away more than 75% of my daily pain. I have also personally witnessed people using kratom to get off of horrible street drugs like heroin. I have seen it save lives. I feel the government should be behind such a wonderful plant that helps so many.  Kratom truly is saving lives every day, whether it's chronic pain patients like me, people with ptsd and anxiety issues, people trying to get off of nasty street drugs or opiate addictions.

Kratom is a relatively harmless plant that has been safely ingested for thousands of years. The plants effects are stimulating at low doses much like caffeine, and relaxing and sedative at higher doses. The plant has never caused a death alone and rarely causes addiction. Kratom could certainly ruin someone's life if the DEA scheduled it and started putting users in jail, other than that the consequences are mild and often times beneficial. Kratom is life changing for many people and allows addicts and chronic pain sufferers to find relief. No one should have to suffer jail time for using something as harmless as kratom, nobody is taking kratom and causing any problems, most people don't even know what it is. It's not a problem and the reaction that it has received from the DEA is inappropriate. I strongly urge the DEA to keep the ban lifted and keep kratom off schedule.

My name is Cody, I am 26 years old and am a customer service associate at a busy convenience store. I strongly urge that the DEA please reconsider placing kratom on the Schedule 1 list. I started using kratom about 4 months ago, as it was recommended to me as a great way to come off of an opiate addiction i had for about 8 years. I must say I really believe this has changed my life. It's the first time I've ever been able to successfully stop using opiates for more than a week or two, as I am now 4 months clean and haven't touched an opiate since I started. This is the first time I really feel like I have a shot in life to do something with myself and not just be an addict. I was at the point in my addiction where I had pretty much just given up, thinking there was no possible way I could ever stop using. Kratom has also helped with the pain i feel in my legs and feet from working on my feet for hours in a row. I've been alot more productive at work because of this, which also allows me to work longer shifts and pick up more hours that i desperately need. I do want to make clear, though, that the main reason I use the kratom is to keep me away from opiates. Kratom alleviates withdrawal symptoms almost completely, and greatly reduces the urge to use opiates altogether. Again, it really has been a life changer.

I have four herniated disks, the start of degenerative disk disease, Fibromyalgia, and chronic migraines... For years, I was a prisoner to oxycodone and morphine for my pain... As well as other medications to combat the depression and anxiety that were a side effect from the opiates and narcotics.  I sought treatment at a local pain clinic. My doctor kept upping my doses of oxycodone and morphine when they stopped working, and the pain slipped through. I became physically dependent on these two legally prescribed medications. My life almost went down the drain.  I could barely focus on work... A job I had been at for 10 years. I knew I had to do something to get my life back. I started doing some research and that's when I found kratom. Kratom helped me safely come off all medications. I have been opiates and narcotics free now since 2014. Since I started using kratom for my pain, I can live again. I can focus on working hard at my job and raising my child.  I still have pain, but for the most part kratom helps me manage my pain without being all doped up like I was when I was on oxycodone and morphine.  Kratom has helped me  become a productive member of society again, while dealing with my health issues. I have never once been \"high\" from it. Never. I take it 3-4 times per day, depending on my pain level that day... And around 1-1.5 teaspoons each time. I cannot afford to go back to using oxycodone and morphine to manage my pain. They nearly ruined my life. Kratom gave me it back. Please, keep this natural plant legal. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17682","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Altimore Altimore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" Hello my fellow Americans, my name is Anthony ,I am from yuba city California.

He took care of our whole household including most of the cleaning, cooking, laundry, maintenance on the house all while working full-time and pursuing a college degree.  On top of that, we were always doing fun stuff and wrestling around.\n\nA few years ago, my mother and him were in a bad car accident while driving to dinner when they were hit my a drunk driver.  My dad's back was hurt really bad and after that, he was rarely ever the same.  You could see him sometimes have good days but he could rarely carry through finish things he started and the housework didnt always get finished.  The environment in our house completely changed as it was more stressful and less happiness.  You could see my dad get eaten away from the pain and the tension between my parents mount.  Three years after the car accident, they got divorced and I have no doubt the car accident caused it.  My dad had been taking the pain meds the doctor gave him but they kept having to give him stronger ones.  I didnt know why at the time but he was getting worse and worse, often oversleeping and not getting up in the evening to care for us.  They finally sent him away for treatment for his back although I know now it was rehab because he was using heroin.\n\nWhen he came back he was sober and in a much better mood but he still hurt really bad.  But, he started using the shredded leaf of a tree.  It looks disgusting but ever since I saw he start taking it he has slowly returned to the dad I grew up with many years ago.  He still has some bad days but now those are the few compared to the good.  He is much more active, he exercises again, he wrestles around with my little sister, he takes me out to do things, he stays on top of housework, he is always working on projects, and most of all - he started his own business and is doing well at it.  The only reason he is able to do this is because he found an oral supplement called kratom.  Without kratom, he would probably still be a shell of himself and he might have to go back to using heroin to get rid of the pain.\n\nIf you schedule kratom, I dont know what will happen to my dad.  His life will likely be ruined as he will have to face using painkillers or living with horrible pain.  The wreck was not his fault, his addiction to painkillers was not his fault, and this would not be his fault.  What kind of choice is that?  I know as I start my life as an adult, I will do so not trusting my own government.  How could I when it makes a decision that could destroy my dad's life by making leafs from a tree illegal to buy or possess.  I have read all the science behind kratom and there is no danger in taking it to anyone.  Dont ruin my father's life and do not ruin my faith in our government as I dont want to live my life like that.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13051","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom medicinally for over 4 years now and worked at 4 bars in the industry.

Many people use the herb, rather than narcotic opiates.  In addition, many addicts resort to crime to help finance their addictions. With legal Kratom use, those same \"criminals\" have found a natural herb to substitute for the opiates, which, as you know, are deadly in many cases. I'm certain that the zealots who are advocating the scheduling, are not aware of how many people consume kratom, to enable them to live pain-free, without physical dependence.  In addition, some people I know, use the herb recreationally, as one might use alcohol or coffee.  For instance, many people stop by an alcohol bar after a long day's work, to have a drink.  I know people, as well, who start their day with a cup of Kratom tea, for that little \"pick me up\" often associated with coffee.  Mark my words.  If laws are passed to make Kratom a controlled substance, tens of thousands of hard-working, productive members of society will return to prescription opiate addiction, or illegal street drugs, and lives of crime.  It seems ludicrous to me, that such a measure can even be contemplated by intelligent, reasonable lawmakers.  But then, my strings are not being pulled by, nor do I receive campaign donations from pharmaceutical companies that might see Kratom as a threat to their profit margins.  Do the right thing for the American people, rather than catering to the very people who ruin so many lives with synthetic LEGAL drugs.\nRespectfully Submitted\n\nThomas W Harrison","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7377","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Harrison","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has profoundly changed my life.

I understand the need to study these chemicals in Mitragyna speciosa, but the plant has far greater utility as a regulated dietary herbal supplement than isolating its chemicals as controlled substances.\n\nI first started using kratom on June 2015 and have been using it since. I use kratom in powdered form currently at a frequency of twice a week in the evenings mixed with orange juice. My usage has not increased, but I often stop using kratom for two weeks and find no problems with consuming it at the same dose after this time. I do not use kratom to self-medicate for pain or mental illness, but I use it much like melatonin and valerian root tea.\n\nMy interest in this plant began by reading Cato Institute articles about kratom, and I was motivated to write about kratom's scheduling after reading a Forbes article published on September 30th titled \"The Benefits of Kratom, And Risks of Kratom Extracts, From The People Who Use The Botanical Medicine\". While the article points out that anecdotal testimonies of kratom users do not tell the whole story about the utility of kratom, I support the author's viewpoints.\n\nwww.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2016/09/30/the-benefits-of-kratom-from-the-people-who-use-the-botanical-medicine/#64b2d3516fca\n\nBefore purchasing kratom, I researched companies online that sold kratom exclusively and found a supplier that provided excellent customer service and dependable quality. In the deregulated environment that kratom exists at this point, I have experienced no misrepresentations of kratom in my orders. I also actively communicate regularly with the company to give consumer feedback and improve their product quality.\n\nIn the past year of my kratom consumption, I have experienced no personal harms and will continue my use of kratom.

It's like coffee that affects my brain functioning rather than speeding up my body. I always bring some with me, but do not always need it. I use 1-2 shifts a week. I have not run into any health issues, or feel like I've formed an addiction. If anything, it has made me realize how much I was drinking out of habit, and curbed that urge quite a bit. Several opiate addicts I know have successfully used Kratom to kick their respective habits, and move on and excel in their own lives. I see no reason to make this plant illegal. Except that \"Big Pharma\" doesn't get a kickback from it. In my experience, it has truly helped change people's lives for the better..

I honorably left the Marine Corps in 2008 as a Captain. During my years in the Marine Corps, I started experiencing painful leg cramps at night and was later diagnosed with RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome). The symptoms of this vary but I can say for me this is a very torturous syndrome. On a nightly basis, my legs can feel like they are being electrocuted when I try to sleep. On a scale of 1-10, my pain is usually in between 8-10. I can sometimes not fall asleep until 4am when the symptoms usually subside. I have been on requip, levodopa, amitryptiline, and gabapentin. None of these worked except for requip for a short duration but with severe side effects such as a strong dependency on this drug. I quit all of these Doctor prescribed drugs and began searching for alternative cures. I decided to try Kratom about 6 months ago and was surprised by how well it works. It has worked 100% of time and it suppresses all symptoms the entire night! I thought this was too good to be true and there would be harmful side effects but there hasn't been any. I feel healthier than I have been in years and am finally getting some great sleep which has benefited my career greatly. Please do not ban Kratom, it should not be regulated since I feel like it is similar to coffee but with slightly more pain killing effects but with less stimulating effects. The American people deserve to have the choice to use supplements like Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16119","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am from Louisville Ky where adderal and pain meds are prescribed way too rampantly.

I have a family and a high ranking position in a corporate company. I cannot drink coffee due to being extremely sensitive to caffeine. I instead use kratom for the energy boost just as millions of Americans use caffeine. I put kratom in the same category when it comes to safety and consumption. Please do the right thing and do not let the pharmaceutical companies win by banning kratom. It will only make them more money and benefit their own interest.

There are times when I have major outbreaks of lupus and it makes me not able to wal,k hard for me to move my hands and extreme pain in my joints. My doctor solution? Opiates and steroids. Which makes me feel like I'm speedballing. Steroids make me have insomnia with major energy and the pain pills make me feel nauseous and lethargic. The two together does not bode well. I found kratom through an herbalist about 4 years ago and it completely changed my life. If I'm having a flare up, major joint pain, all I have to do is take this leaf that grows from a tree swallow it and I feel amazing. Do I feel high off of it? Absolutely not. I get no Euphoria whatsoever. I do not feel like I'm on opiates. What I do feel is pain relief. I'm able to stand up and walk I'm able to open and close my hands I'm able to go to work and have my career back which I've had for 25 years!

I have been a regular user of Kratom for roughly 5 years. I began using Kratom when I had been sober from alcohol for about a year. I sought out Kratom because I was struggling with an intense desire to drink combined with general anxiety and depression. I found consuming ground Kratom leaf as a tea to help greatly with the issues I mentioned above. I have experienced no negative side effects from Kratom, and strongly feel that it has been an integral tool in maintaining long term sobriety from alcohol. Kratom, along with therapy, regular exercise and meditation has greatly reduced my anxiety and depression.\nKratom should not be placed in schedule 1. It is not dangerous. Being in the recovery/12-step community, I know many others like me who use Kratom as a tool to maintain sobriety. I have several people in my family who use it to alleviate chronic pain issues. I feel that the health and well being of so many individuals has been put in jeapordy because of this proposed ban.

The DEA's propensity to classify things Schedule-1 does, has done, and or would do more harm than good when DEA essentially removes the item from routine study and criminalizes it. This DEA approach seems only to be based on a few negative  anecdotal reports and inter-alia  it causes criminalization as an unneeded side effect, and ignores centuries of positive anecdotal evidence.  It would be of considerably more benefit that academic  and medical researchers have easy access to substances like KRATOM and to be encouraged to assess the true situation through scientific measures and peer reviewed journals. In the meantime the public could obtain their KRATOM from possibly the local supermarket.

This plant based drug is safe and effective and can help those with severe drug dependencies. It seems to me the only reason you would make it a Schedule I drug is due to it's effectiveness and the fact that members of the FDA hold patents in the pharmaceutical industry and do not wish for drugs like Kratom, in it's effectiveness, to be on the market. Please do not illegalize this plant. We need our alternative natural medicines as pharmaceuticals are typically a band aid and do not help recovery and permanent cures. Kratom, when taken on a regular basis, increases brain functions and provides an alternative stimulant (allowing a slight increase in dopapine levels/release into the brain)... to drugs such as heroine and cocaine, a much needed remedy for those struggling with addiction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4391","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kim Anderberg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I wanted to leave a comment voicing my opinion that before the rash decision to reclassify kratom as a schedule 1 drug there be an objective scientific  look in to  its medicinal value.

I was able to get off of the addictive medications, and regulate my pain with this wonderful herb. \n\nI dont get high off kratom. I take just one teaspoon three times per day, which alleviates my pain and anxiety, to the point where I am a functioning adult once again.

I used to be prescribed Tylenol with codeine for pain and anti-depressants for depression. I ended up getting very tired from the pain meds and I gained lots of weight with the anti depressants. Those were just some of the side effects. I have a young child and did not like the negative effects the prescription medications had on me. It was hard to be a mommy and wife when I was so tired and in pain. Also, with the opiate abuse epidemic sweeping our country and spinning out of control, I was worried I would become addicted.  After doing some online research I came across kratom. I began taking it for the menstrual pain and noticed that it quickly relieved my menstrual cramps and I was able to still have energy and not feel out of it while parenting. I also noticed it had a profound effect on my depression. I noticed I was happier and full of life. I didn't get a \"high\" feeling that is typical with pain killers. I have continued to use kratom for almost 4 years and I don't know what I would do if the ban was placed on kratom. I feel like my daughter would lose the mom she deserves. I would also like to mention that I am employed full time and in the Healthcare industry. I have received several recommendations as well as months of perfect attendance at my work. Kratom has had nothing but a positive effect on my life, I ask that you truly consider not banning kratom for the sake of myself and my family and others with similar situations. \n\nSincerely,\n\nAvid Kratom User \nMV","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14783","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"hello, i think you have to research this drug alot more. this sounds like the perfect plant!  \n\nSincerely\n\nErik Arne Grong","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10598","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erik Arne Grong","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a wonderful friend who doesn't have Healthcare and can't afford drugs for her pain.

I do not use recreational drugs and limit my alcohol intake to 1-2 servings of wine, 1-2X a week.   In 2011 I had a laminectomy/fusion of the L4/5 vertebra to stabilize congenital spondylolisthesis.  For several years leading up to the surgery I was in chronic pain and under the care of my physician.  I followed the recommended treatments to attempt to avoid the surgery.  In progression - physical therapy, NSAIDs, epidurals, acupuncture, hydrocodone (Vicodin) and ultimately to morphine just prior to the surgery.  \n\nApproximately 1 year after the surgery, I began to experience weakness in my legs, shooting pain in my hips, and sore knees and feet.  I have a very difficult time sleeping and have had to curtail exercise.  I have never been able to tolerate opioid pain medicine well and experience significant gastrointestinal issues and I cannot function in my job, due to the side effect of opioid grogginess.  I am employed as a technical expert in the petrochemical and environmental industries and I have been in a continuous random drug-testing program for the past 29 years and must declare my prescription use to my employers HR/Medical Officer.  When I had to take opioids for pain, it precludes me from some functions where I might operate safety equipment or vehicles.  After the surgery, I have refused to take opioids and only use a Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS or TNS) unit and NSAIDs, but they do not provide enough relief to sleep through the night.\n\nDuring online research for pain management I became aware of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine (Kratom) and have been taking a night dose of 1-2 grams, for the last year, whenever I have a pain flare-up.  I am now able to sleep through an entire night and I wake the next day with a clear mind and do not experience the grogginess that I had with opioids.  After a year of use I have never experienced any craving for the natural pain-killer, and do not experience any side effects, nor any sensation of a \"high\" feeling, unlike opioids.\n\nI urge the DEA to refrain from classifying this as a Schedule I drug and recommend that rigorous clinical trials and triple-blind studies be performed at respected medical and homeopathic institutes as well and be subject to critical peer-review by experts. Ultimately, I hope to see Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine (Kratom) to be left as a non-schedule homeopathic treatment for pain, thereby allowing the American public to be able to make our own decisions on how and with with what natural medicine we use to manage our bodies and health concerns.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0080","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is helping keep me from a life of pain and depression.

I am a 25 year old white male. I currently work in retail and have some college education. I have been dealing with chronic migraines ever since i was 7 years old and still do. From the age of 12 to 22 I suffered from drug addiction. I mostly used a wide variety of opiates including the injection of heroine. However, I am also a recovering alcoholic and have used a vast array of other substances. I provide this background because it is important to understand why I started using Kratom. About three years ago i decided to get clean and entered a rehab, and from there a sober house and the AA/NA program. Without the tools provided to me through these programs I would not still be clean today. But it is important to note that Kratom played a very important part in keeping me on a straight and narrow path when i could have very easily relapsed. When i first got clean I already heard about Kratom through a friend who had used it before. When i felt the very strong desire to use opiates again, i turned to a local smoke shop that carried Kratom and purchased a small amount. In my opinion it saved my life that day because if i couldn't have gotten a safe alternative to opiates in the early stages of recovery i would have turned to heroine. In my opinion and from my experience, Kratom was a better alternative than Suboxone or Methadone, as I have tried both. Kratom does not have the addictive qualities or the type of effects that these drugs have. Now three years clean later I still use Kratom once in a while because I still suffer from terrible chronic migraines. I take medicine that works well reducing the frequency of the headaches, but when i have one I am mostly incapacitated, which has severely affected my ability to work. On those days i can take a dose of Kratom and it helps me get through the day. It can not go understated how much this has helped me live my day to day life now that i am a functioning member of society. In fact, It is because of Kratom that i can say that at all. If the DEA were to ban the alkaloids in Kratom, making it virtually impossible to use, my life would severely change for the worse and I don't know what i would do.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2374","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary Kaston","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has proved very useful to me in my withdrawal from Vicodin and Soma use related to my chronic pain from herniated discs in my lower back.

It has been extremely helpful with all withdrawal symptoms related to discontinuing these medications, which were beginning to have detrimental effects on my heath.  I have been able to sleep soundly after adding a very small amount of Kratom.  I used to suffer from insomnia and wake up once or twice during the night.  My health has greatly improved since weaning off of the medications.  I am able to function with clarity and cognition, which was not true when I was taking the medication.  I have not suffered any side effects or detrimental effects from the use of Kratom.  If anything it helps me focus more clearly, and also helps with the relief of the pain.  I have also noticed a decrease in my anxiety level.  It has been very healing to have my sleep cycle return to normal, including remembering my dreams again.  I am committed to this new level of health and would not consider taking any prescription pain medication or anxiety medicine in the future, but without the assistance of the small amount of Kratom, many of the detrimental effects (pain, anxiety, insomnia) would most likely return.  Kratom has proved to be helpful to so many and it would really be a step backward for people to return to prescription medications that would eventually prove harmful to their health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7954","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helped me immensely with my symptoms due to withdrawal from Benzodiazepines.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it!

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works... It uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies. http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes... Thailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects. http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

The virtual polar opposite of something illegal, and you want to make it illegal. You're all fools, and your time in power will be over very quickly if you do not start respecting the wishes of we the people. \n\nIf someone could just explain to me how kratom is somehow on par with heroin, in a way I cannot completely destroy (an impossible task, which is just my point), then I'd bow out. But you won't, because you can't, because bans such as this have nothing to do with public health, or safety, or anything, it's about government types like yourselves lording over people you no doubt look down on from your comfortable positions. If the concern is there being chemicals or pesticides in it, well, that should be an issue with the vendors, not the substance as a whole.\n\nThat aside, I've been using kratom for years, and I am still here, still healthy, because I shop organic kratom only, and if there ARE unknown variables in it, they've done nothing to harm me. I said it before and I will say it again, if you ban kratom, lives will be lost, not the least of which may be my own because the thought of not having access to it in times of need, when my physical pain is at it's worst, when my depression hits me hard, or just when I need extra energy to get work done in order so I can clothe and feed myself, is flat out horrifying. \n\nI cannot afford prescriptions, nor do I want them, they have awful side effects I experienced as a child. Kratom is harmless, you idiots just don't want us to be able to live outside your Matrix, God forbid we have alternatives to traditional medicine, God forbid we need not rely on the government to tell us what's good and bad for us, God forbid we make our own decisions. I don't care if it IS harmful which it isn't, it should be my decision, and you've no right to deny me that.

I pay more than my fair share in taxes and by most measures I am considered a very successful contributor to society. I maintain a good quality of life despite suffering from chronic neck pain (I have had two neck surgeries). Throughout three decades of chronic pain, I have tried many prescription medications that have been ineffective, have side-effects and/or have addiction risk (e.g., Vicodin).  However, beginning approximately three years ago, I found pain relief through the use a natural remedy - Kratom. I purchase Kratom powder from a reputable supplier and I make capsules that I consume. Kratom provides relief from pain and it doesn't \"get me high\".  I only use Kratom when the pain is at its worst. It has not been addictive whatsoever. It has been a Godsend to relieve pain while allowing me to function normally. The government should not take away my right to use this natural and safe remedy. Please, do not classify Kratom as a Schedule 1 substance.  Losing the right to use this natural remedy will very negatively impact my quality of life and my ability to contribute to society. Without Kratom, I will likely choose to live with constant pain. I do not want to use prescription opiates that prevent me from functioning at the level needed for my job.  Further, prescription opiates present an addiction risk that has not been an issue with Kratom. I also question whether the Executive Branch has the right to make this determination.  Isnt it the job of Congress to make laws and the responsibility of the Executive branch enforce them??  \n\nThank you for considering my situation as you debate this matter.

I have suffered with anxiety and depression as well as chronic pain for many years. These ailments have caused me a lot of suffering and pain and before finding kratom I was presecribed anti anxiety medications and battled with alcohol issues as well. Since finding Kratom I now have no problems with anxiety or depression. I have been taking kratom for over a year and I do not find any need to increase my dosage of 8 capsules a day and I have no withdrawal symptoms if I choose to not take the plant. I often take days off just because I am feeling good without it as well. There has been zero negative effects on my life caused by this plant and if it were to become illegal that would be incredibly depressing. I've seen so many friends stop using opiates, even intravenous heroin,  by using kratom.

Foolishly I tracked it down and ordered some online, thinking that since it's legal it must be relatively harmless. Boy was I wrong. Within a couple weeks I was physically dependent on kratom, unable to stop due to the severity of the withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, nausea, general discomfort, and more) which would occur within a few hours of missing a dose. I was spending upwards of 5 hundred dollars a month on this drug. Even more troubling, I have no idea what was actually in the drug that I was ordering online since it's not regulated by the FDA. For all I know, there were lots of harmful additives or byproducts in the kratom I was receiving. Anyway I finally reached out to family and told them I had a problem, and that I needed help to quit. I was able to quit the drug just by sheer grit as the horrendous withdrawal symptoms wracked my body for 3 days. This is not a fate I would wish on anyone (except possibly the numerous companies online and on the street that sell the drug with impunity). Please make this drug ILLEGAL.

I am a professional musician by trade. I have been taking kratom on a daily basis for 4 years now to help with my anxiety, as well as some physical pain from an old shoulder injury from years ago.  For years I tried different over-the-counter and prescription drugs to treat my anxiety, and i had varying success with what was available. When I learned from a friend about kratom and its benefits as a dietary supplement, I wanted to give it a try. Kratom has been nothing short of a miracle plant for me! It helps with my anxiety more efficiently and safely than prescription pills. It is safer than benzos and other narcotic anxiety medications, and it is non-addictive and natural. I can't imagine a better remedy for my problems! There is no danger of overdose, and the worse that can happen is an upset stomach if i accidentally take too much.  Kratom has been a life-saving dietary supplement for me.\nI absolutely oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. This would have a direct, negative impact on my daily life, and I would have to resort to pharmaceuticals instead of a natural plant remedy. This would be devastating, as I searched for years and years before i found kratom to be the best solution for my anxiety (and it helps with my shoulder pain, as i mentioned).\nI believe that kratom needs to remain legal and available to everyone who has found it to be helpful for any variety of personal uses.

This of course would require this plant not be categorized as a section 1 drug.

We must help our future generations by educating ourselves before demonizing beneficial plants.  More users and more testing can help demolish the stigma plants like Kratom and Marijuana have. I do not use either but I have tried several \"drugs\" in my youth and I don't believe any substance I've tried had a negative effect on my life.

Quality control was an issue, and also since Kratom is weak and not for parties, wholesalers added research chemicals to Kratom beginning in 2009, which is why Indiana was the first state to ban Kratom.  Enhanced Kratom, \"isolated alkaloids\".  I don't really believe enhanced Kratom had anything to do with Kratom.                          o-desmethyltramadol, a cleaner version of tramadol, was added I believe.  Who knows what else was added to Kratom to make it appealing to hedonistic drug seekers.  So banning Kratom is really trying to ban research chemicals imo.  -------  Kratom is good and bad, weak if anything, benign, but I found functionality with it and worked despite fibromyalgia, and extreme extremity pain.  Chronic pain, and I have feet problems.  I also abstained from alcohol for 13 years while using Kratom.  Kratom doesn't mix well with many things.  Kratom did make me euphoric maybe once a week or so with daily use.  I could not take it in the morning and experience euphoria.  It seemed to work better later in the day.  \n\nI doubt Kratom has ever killed anyone, it never caused me any respiratory depression.  Never any heart problems like some people want to suggest.  I can't say I respected Kratom always, so I can attest to it's safety.  I quit a year ago because I am living in a banned state now.  I didn't have any withdrawals.  I had mental cravings at times before a year ago.   Kratom is nice like a cup of coffee.  It is not strong, also it makes ones tolerance for nicotine lower so one uses less nicotine.  \n\n   It would be nice if Kratom was regulated like cigarettes are now, by the FDA, perhaps taxed as well, it would be worth it to me.  I hated getting bad quality Kratom.  Even bad Kratom was generally good though.  There are at least 10 different types of Kratom that has different effects.  I have never seen or heard of anyone going crazy on it as suggested by some folks who have no experience with it.  I have known quite a few professionals using it.  Kratom doesn't do much.  It also never seems to lose it's effectiveness over time, like months like other things do.  It does lose effectiveness in the short term.  It is much like coffee in that one gets diminishing returns quickly.  But also is like coffee in that it works for years. \n\n Thank you for reading.  The people that support Kratom are some of the nicest people I have ever known.  They all maybe have experience with harder things, but are willing to compromise for kratoms lack of hedonism.  Kratom doesn't do much at all except give a mild mood lift sometimes, make one work harder, make one friendlier if they are in pain, helps fibromyalgia.  It would be nice if herbs and such were regulated.  That there was a specific dose and quality checks in place.  Thank you for your time on this boring subject to you probably.  I don't know about fairness, and people having jobs and such... The older I get and the more educated I become, I get sour, hopefully you can make a good decision based on the American population and not Doctors prescribing chemicals that are patented, and people that benefit from the legal system.   Information and education helps society.  Most people want one sentence to sum up things, Kratom can't be summed up in one sentence.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2976","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant saved my son from addiction","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5198","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"kaye slimick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to give my story on kratom and how it saved the relationships I have with my family, friends, coworkers, and strangers. When I was a senior in high school I started to develop a social anxiety. I had a lot of friends and was generally pretty outgoing. My anxiety didn't affect my ability to talk to people or meet strangers. The social amxiety I developed was sweating of my buttocks. It started off in class one day my butt just felt hot and I didn't know why. To make a long story short, it started to get worse and it became something that occurred anytime I was around people. I still didn't know why until I did my research, it never happened when I was alone, only around people. I would worry about it, which would trigger it. It happened more often and became worse. The smell that it gave off was one that made eyes water. I became depressed and avoided human contact when possible. One day I discovered kratom. The shop I was in was a vape shop and they had a sign above the kratom saying it could possibly help treat pain, give energy, relax, or treat social anxiety (depending on the strain). I did some research on kratom and gave it a try next time I went to hang out with friends. The feeling came on fairly quickly and it was an overall relaxing feeling and made me feel at peace with my anxiety and who I am as a person. I now take kratom whenever I encounter a situation where the anxiety would kick in and it makes my mind not focus on my anxiety (which thinking about it was what triggered it). I have not beaten my anxiety, when not on kratom it still kicks in strong, but I have reduced its effects drastically and am still working to beat it. If kratom is made illegal I don't know if I could go on with how my relationships will be ruined. It's hard to act normal and enjoy yourself when you smell worse than a dumpster, even though I shower every day. I have heard plenty of stories of people relieving pain and kicking drug addiction with kratom but I haven't heard many anxiety stories. I just thought I should give a point of view on its other treatments. Kratom saved my life, I don't want it to go into shambles. Please don't schedule kratom. I have never had any bad effects in my year since discovering it. It helps thousands of people get their lives together when they would be a mess without it.

It became obvious that my opiod use was controlling my life and depression was becoming an issue. When I heard that this leaf could help the sickness I tried it and was amazed by the ease of it and the power that my mind had with the use of this herbal tea. I stopped taking oxycodone immediately and began a twice a day once in morning and evening tea from Kratom extract.\n\nI have taken suboxone in the past before the restrictions and now the hassle of getting to a special doctor and the expense of the drug was just not possible in my line of work. With three kids and a job I needed something that was not going to put me out of work.. This was a miracle and within a week I was able to stop the kratom and deal with the milder effects of my withdrawals after being empowered with confidence I could do it. It has now been three weeks I have a half a bottle of oxycodon in my possession and have no desire to take it nor do I have the desire to take Kratom anymore. My mood is improving and I was able to go on a work trip for 5 days with no pills or Kratom for the first time in over 10 years. My back is better and the oxycodon became a crutch that I needed to feel normal. Now I feel better and younger then I have for many years. my outlook on life is different also. \n\nThis is no placebo medicine or some mild herb but a miracle medicinal herb that needs to be treated as a cure to opiod withdrawals and researched. I do agree that if abused it can be a very bad trip and not much of a cure. But for us who are suffering from the effects of opiod withdrawals it is the best and most practical solution ever and can be administered in the privacy of ones home even with a stressful life at ones own time frame and determination. \n\nPlease remember that we who are responsible working Americans are out there trying to survive and just because one may abuse a substance like Kratom it is not a reason to out law it from us all. You can abuse salt or coffee or sugar and become addicted or sick too but this is a cure for the many afflicted with opiod dependence.  Thanks for your consideration on this very special tree that God put here in my opinion as a help support mankind's health and happiness. God Bless that tree.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1066","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Greg Holzman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Study this more..Research it more...Don't ban it...

I believe that kratom should remain unscheduled. I am a 37 year-old woman and I have a job in Data Entry as well as a licensed Master Esthetician. \nI found kratom after over 15 years on many Rx medications, in January of 2015. I only wish you could understand what is was like feeling that my life was not worth living, on a daily basis.  I lost my quality of life due to a car accident on the way to work in 2001. I used to take somewhere between 3 to 10 prescriptions per month ever since that accident. I suffer from severe chronic neck/back/ body pain, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, degenerative disc disorder, and Celiac disease, anxiety and depression.   \nKratom has helped give me my life back in so many ways, helping me to feel better and be able to get up every morning with my son for school, do dishes, cook dinner and many more mundane tasks that felt impossible. I am now able to do more than just lay on the couch, wishing each day away and hoping that I dont wake up in the morning. It is very painful to live with those thoughts, especially since I have a husband and child that rely on me. Kratom has also helped me to go back to work and with that, we have been able to stop using all public assistance, such as housing food stamps, and Medicaid. You cannot imagine the joy in my heart to be able to provide for myself and my family. Even being able to go out and venture around with my family instead of just having the two of them go out alone.\nI feel kratom should be able to be used by anyone that needs it, without any interference from the government. It is not dangerous, there are no deaths from kratom and it is far safer than any liquor or even fast food, available on every corner. \n\t\nThank you very much for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3544","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom seems like something that can be very helpful to people in harmful addictions to pills.

My name is Andrew and I am a 24 year old recent university graduate holding a 4 year degree in Business Administration. I am writing this in reference to \"Docket No. DEA-442W\". For the purpose of this comment \"kratom\" will be referencing \"Mitragyna speciosa\". First I would like to start out by stating my stance on the subject matter after which I will provide personal experience along with scientific evidence. \n\nKratom is a natural tree-like plant belonging to the Mitragyna genus of the Rubiaceae family, the same plant family as coffee [1]. Kratom is not a chemical, it is not a bath salt, and it is not a recreational drug. Kratom cannot be smoked, and has a foul taste.\n\nI am opposed to any scheduling of kratom. I believe kratom should be classified as a dietary supplement. The Center for Regulatory Effectiveness states their \"position is similar to the program in place in Canada where kratom is classified as a natural health product.\" [3]\n\nI have consumed kratom tea for 4 years to improve general wellbeing and to support healthy digestion. During these 4 years I have only experienced positive effects. I never had an adverse effect from the consumption of kratom tea. During these 4 years, I brought my body mass index from a 26.5 (overweight) to a 23.7 (normal) [2]. I have stomach issues from consuming coffee and thus consume kratom, in the form of a warm tea, as an alternative for an energy boost in the morning. Just as it would be unconstitutional to restrict some ones usage of coffee, it would be unconstitutional to restrict my ability to drink kratom tea as a natural way to increase my energy and productivity levels.\n\nKratom also helps me stay focused on tasks at hand. In these past 4 years I self-taught myself video game design, I created an artist persona and successfully released music, and created a YouTube channel that has brought in a small amount of revenue. Just as some people have benefits from one coffee in the morning, I get the same effect from kratom in terms of productivity. A few hours of lost productivity in a day might not seem like much. But in terms of a few decades, I truly believe this could amount to thousands if not hundredths of thousands of dollars I would be missing out on due to lost productivity, and thus decreasing my quality of life in the years to come. That is not fair, and I urge you to make the correct choice regarding this matter.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health \"reports no pervasive health issues attributed to the ingestion of Kratom products in Florida.\" [4] In a study financed by the Ministry of Health-Malaysia, that \"investigated the acute toxicity of standardized MS leaf aqueous extract on Sprague Dawley rats\" [6], no deaths were observed and \"the single oral dose of the extract also had no significant changes in the body weight, food and water consumption. The relative weights of the internal organs were also normal\" [6]. \n\nI would like to end with a quote from Dr. Walter C. Prozialeck's \"Update on the Pharmacology and Legal Status of Kratom\" article from the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association: \"After evaluating the literature, I can reach no other conclusion than, in pure herbal form, when taken at moderate doses of less than 10 to 15 g, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively benign in the vast majority of users\" [5]. Kratom is my dietary supplement which I consume in the form of tea. Kratom has increased my productivity, improved my general well-being, and overall improved my quality of life.\n\nThank you for taking my comment into consideration and God bless you!\n\n1.\thttp://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2094342\n2.\thttps://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/quick-guides/what-is-a-healthy-weight\n3.\thttp://www.thecre.com/forum11/?p=301\n4.\thttp://speciosa.org/official-statewide-intelligence-drug-report-kratom-and-the-impact-to-florida/\n5.\thttp://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524\n6.\thttp://speciosa.org/acute-toxicity-study-of-standardized-mitragyna-speciosa-korth-aqueous-extract-in-sprague-dawley-rats/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22727","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Dan Luke and I am a 29 year old parts manager at a local truck shop and a father of 4 children.\nI think Kratom should stay legal and should not be regulated by the DEA.

I unfortunately deal with chronic pain from severe scoliosis, and fibromyalgia. Scoliosis (on top of the widespread body pain from myalgia) causes my whole body to hurt- the main structure of the body is twisted and bent; the only outcome is for it to impact the rest of the body, knees, hips, neck- all out of \"whack\". Because of this EVERYDAY pain (5-9/10 on the pain scale), it causes depression. The only way I've dealt with it (both the pain and depression, self-pity and worry of my future integrity) was to trudge through the day with narcotic pain medication (prescribed)- and just sit on the couch after work. UNTIL I found kratom through an internet search for herbal remedies for pain- since I was desperate. It saddened me to think that at only 30 years old (with kids in my future), it would only get worse. I started with making a cup of tea with a few teaspoons of crushed LEAF. In 10 minutes I felt the aching pain just stop, and my mood was lifted. I all of a sudden had energy and focus all day long. I wasn't \"high\". I was \"high on life\"  and even more so when I was able to completely stop taking narcotic pills daily, and had the desire to get out of the house and be with people. It doesn't solve all of my problems; but it's the closest I've ever come. I hope to GOD that the DEA doesn't move forward with banning the LEAF. My life will drastically change- for the worse.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3052","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katie Dietl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"there is no good  reason to ban kratom  I have taken this herb  to relieve pain for years, it has no real side effects  as pain pills do if anything it helps people to get off drugs\n\nthank you James Davis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14916","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"james davis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This and all plants have medicinal uses whether you've found and evaluated them or not.

After about 5 years, I became very addicted to the prescribed opiates and also built up a tolerance to them. In trying to get off of opiates I tried going to a pain clinic, but it just traded the percocets and fentyal for methadone, which is just as addictive and deadly. I searched for a long time for something natural and safe to help with both my addiction and agonizing pain. That's when I read about kratom. I did alot of research and decided to give it a try. After 30 minutes of taking my first dose my pain had subsided to a level that use to be only achieved with 4 percocets and a fentyal patch, and there was no 'high' feeling at all. I actually cried for a day because I couldn't believe it. That was a year ago and I take  kratom 3 times a day with no side affects whatsoever, I have not felt any withdrawal when I stopped taking it, only the return of the pain. \nPlease reconsider placing kratom as a schedule one substance.

After visiting with my doctor, I was prescribed hydrocodone for pain. For several months I continued taking hydrocodone, but my symptoms were getting worse. The next treatment was a lumbar epidural steroid injection; this helped for a couple of months, but after those couple of months, my pain symptoms worsened. I started seeing an orthopedic doctor. Based off an MRI, my orthopedic doctor recommended surgery (to remove a portion of the disc that was bulging), and diagnosed me with degenerative-disc disorder. After having micro-discectomy surgery, I continued taking prescribed medicine for pain, but also during this time, read about kratom. When my prescription for pain medicine was empty, I had a choice to make, go ask the doctor for more pain medicine, or try a natural alternative. Instead of asking for another prescription of pain medication, I started taking kratom tea, as needed, for pain. \n\nKratom has helped me deal with nagging to severe back-pain. While taking prescription pain medication, I always felt brain-fog, lack of motivation, and lack of concentration. Kratom does not give me brain-fog, or lack of motivation, and I feel that it helps my concentration. Kratom has allowed me to function without the need for prescription pain medication. I do not want to go back to asking a doctor for pain medication. I do not want to deal with all of the side effects of prescription pain medication. \n\nConclusion: Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important uses and has changed my life. I fear any scheduling by the FDA/DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic. If there is concern over Kratom's alkaloids, please consider more research, and leaving this wonderful plant available to all, without prohibitive scheduling. I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without access to kratom.\n\nI have included links to information that may be helpful:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nNJyNf5WqQ7ixmvpkqsfA/videos\nwww.americankratom.org/aka_fact_sheet\nwww.businesswire.com/news/home/20150908006067/en/Experts-Speak-Benefits-Kratom-Mistake-Ban\n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18357","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Stevens","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was addicted to opiates for 12 years.

I have ectopic endometriosis that had eaten into some organs causing sickness and extreme pain. Doctors wouldn't treat me because I had no insurance. Eventually I couldn't deal with the pain anymore and nearly killed myself by ODing on Benadryl. \n\nYes, you can OD on Benadryl, but not on Kratom. \n\nThanks to my husband, I survived, and soon he came home and told me about Kratom, which he heard about online from a forum where a heroin addict had started taking it as part of rehab to quit. \n\nThat was two years ago. Kratom literally did save my life. I was able to get my career back on track and my family was able to go off welfare and get our own house. \n\nMy disease is not curable, barely treatable with frequent surgeries. the last one was five hrs long. Endo was in my gi tract, fused parts of it to my low back muscles and eaten into my sciatica, gallbladder, appendix, urinary tract, and internal abdominal wall.\n\nWith Kratom, I can deal with the pain, depression and low energy from my disease because it treats all of those things.\n\nThe statements made by the DEA are without merit, you cannot get high, hallucinate, or OD on Kratom. It is far safer than many prescriptions that treat these health problems.\n\nKratom is a tropical plant in the coffee family from Southeast Asia that has been used to support energy and focus, as well as a potent immune system booster.  Kratom is inherently safe and shares many therapeutic constituents in common with other widely recognized medicinal plants such as Cats Claw and Yohimbe, which currently enjoy wide spread and safe usage as dietary supplements in the United States and abroad. A simple Google search for Mitragyna speciosa will find over 1,660 search results documenting the potential medical value of Kratom. There are millions of people in America who use Kratom for depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain relief, energy and other legitimate health issues. \n\nPlease help keep Kratom legal and available for us.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4737","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lindsey Avery","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Currently we have an epidemic that has destroyed thousands of lives and Kratom gives those who suffer from chronic pain an option that is substantially better than what is available.

I strongly disagree with the proposition the DEA has put forward to ban the plant Kratom from the United States. I am a Kratom user and an active member of society who is accomplishing great things in my industry. I have struggled with Crippling anxiety my whole entire life since i was a kid. I have been suicidal, and self medicated with alcohol which nearly killed me a number of times. I know officers who work in the DEA  and have a lot of respect for them, but i just cant agree with this decision. Other than being a kratom user I have been a witness to lives being absolutely crushed by opiates. Families torn apart, death, destruction, crime. It is plain to see that kratom offers relieve for opiate addiction without the risk of death from respiratory depression. The reaction of the public in the first place to the DEA decision should be enough to just take off the table completely. I have educated countless people who agree and just dont speak up. Kratom Saves life's.. plain and simple! it saved mine. The pharmaceutical drugs are far more dangerous than kratom is and that is obvious just based on raw data that anyone can see. The DEA should embrace and be thankful for kratom because there job is to fight drugs that harm families and kill people and create industry for criminals.  I have a lot of respect for the DEA and i hope they listen to the people and make the right decision this time. I am a good and successful person and kratom has helped me immensely and saved my life and allowed me to go after my dreams and be an inspiration to my town. We need more time with this issue and more awarness about the benefits. The people DEA arent properly educated. I called my local DEA office and they didnt even know what kratom was or that the organization was moving to ban it! Kratom saves lives, it is not and opiate, its safer than methadone, and i Have seen to many loved ones die at the hans of prescription drugs... it is a crisis and why the DEA moving to rid the nation of a remedy that is safe doesnt make sense. It will certaintly haunt them if it does pass and drop DEA support from people substantially. I know i would lose faith in an organization i have for so long repspected.

Some of the many known benefits of Kratom are that they provide a natural moderate pain relief for people who have chronic pain, who refuse to rely on the far more potent and dangerously addictive pharmaceutical pain medication. It has also been proven to be highly effective for soldiers who suffer from PTSD, allowing them to live more normal lives and get through the problems they have experienced. And lastly, but not least, Kratom has been proven to help people who are addicted to pharmaceutical opiates to break their addiction, because in the altered chemistry of the addicts brain, the natural chemicals in Kratom help alleviate the sever pains and psychological cravings when they go into withdrawals. All of these effects that I have listed are coming from a wholly natural plant leaf, which does not get the user \"high\", which a vast number of people feel is vital in todays world.\n\nPlease take this very seriously, because if the DEA does schedule Kratom and make it impossible for people to\nobtain, thousands of those people will very likely have no choice but to return to using illicit drugs, begin suffering from PTSD,\nand those with chronic pain will have to go back to the highly addictive chemicals pushed by the medical and pharmaceutical networks.\n\nThe citizens of the United States, are demanding that you to listen to our voices, and the voices of Senator Hatch and many many other congressmen in his \"Dear Colleague\" letter to the House and Senate to stand against the DEA and their decision. Stop your continuation of your \"War on Drugs\" because it has NOT worked... it has only lead to thousands of people being thrown into prison cells and lives ruined for committing non-violent acts. And stop trying to hide your alterior agenda under the guise of \"public safety\" when you know that this plant, Kratom, in no way creates a public safety concern. This issue should not even have to be evaluated by the FDA... the people of this nation have individual rights, and you are not allowed to impede on those rights, unless someone has violated the rights of another or committed fraud against them. Stop trying to legislate your \"morality\" and your corporate interests. \n\nI appreciate your consideration, and truly hope that this information helps you to make the right decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0042","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking Kratom for roughly 9 months now and before that I was dependent on hydrocodone for 7 years. I started taking them for migraines and soon they stopped working for that and I took them for the euphoric feeling that they provided. However coming down from them made me irritable as hell and many times would cause more headaches! Kratom on the other hand works on so many different levels! I also suffer from anxiety and depression and Kratom helps with general and social anxiety, I take it for pain relief and it also gives me energy! Not once have I noticed any side effects from my consumption of the herb. I have never experienced a high feeling or hallucinations as some have claimed! If anyone ever has it was probably due in part to taking other drugs in which case no one can control! Kratom has bettered my life in so many ways, no more migraines, anxiety and depression!I've never felt addicted to Kratom like I was to hydrocodone. It is an amazing supplement and I don't know what I would look to for my health issues if it was banned. There is absolutely no reason to ban Kratom other than the fact that it does work for so many things and the pharmaceutical companies feel threatened by it cause it's natural, they can't make money from it and their afraid people will turn to natural remedies and they won't be rolling in cash like their used to. For Kratom to be listed as a schedule 1 substance is just stupidity! The DEA has no right to take away a natural substance that God provided for us. Focus attention instead on the thousands of deaths each year from pharmaceutical painkillers! But of course they won't cause there's too many people in the industry becoming disgustingly rich from the sale of painkillers irregardless of people's  health and well being.

This is rather painful and is the only thing that has made me cry out in pain after a lifetime of physical activity.\n\nBecause of my arthritic pain I started looking for a pain killer that would help me. After reading about opioid drugs I did not feel like that was a good route to go. I did start using Tramadol. That helped a lot. Tramadol does not impair my mental capacity, nor my co-ordination. This is good because I enjoy doing carpentry and that involves power tools. Unfortunately, my arthritis pain has gotten much worse in the past 6 months and Tramadol was not doing the trick. Maybe, I developed a tolerance for it?\n\nSo a month ago I read an article about Kratom. I was extremely wary about taking something new. My research however could not find any real issues. I read your warning that 15 people had died using Kratom. But apparently those deaths were complicated by other drugs in the victims. In addition the testimonials I read indicated this was actually safe and something I should try. In fact I wondered how many people died using aspirin. The answer was 15,000. That's a lot.\n\nI have been using Kratom for about one month now. I am not experiencing any problems. The only thing that happens is that my pain is gone and I am still clear headed and I can move with out any pain or coordination problems. I use a very small amount and it works fantastically. I hope that you do not restrict my access to Kratom. In fact, I hope that some research is done to determine scientifically what is good or bad about Kratom. I will keep you posted on my experience and you are welcome to contact me at anytime.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve Sembritzky","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello and thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak.

I have been an occasional recreational user for over ten years now and have experienced nothing but positive benefits from using the substance.   I have primarily used it as an alternative to anti-depressants and alcohol, both of which are far more damaging to myself and society at large. Apart from my personal experience, there is no conclusive evidence that the herb causes damage to the body, nor has it been solely responsible for the death of any individuals (outside of a few controversial cases).  Furthermore, scheduling this substance as a drug will create a tide of intended negative consequences.  Changing the legality will decrease quality, increase price, increase opiate usage, and create criminals from good working honest Americans.  It is clear that drug policy in America needs to be reformed.  All the war on drugs has managed to obtain is to cause massive violence and corruption in Mexico, our neighbors to the south.  We need to evolve our drug policy and one first step is to give the state's the power to make those decisions.  This is evident from the success of the legalization of marijuana in Washington and Colorado with California and Oregon joining the cause.  Lets stop perpetuating a failed approach in regard to drug possession and usage and put our efforts into education and treatment instead.  If you still feel it is necessary to schedule the substance than at least do your due diligence.  Conduct research studies, review existing ones, and provide an intelligent and thoughtful response to critics.  Trying to emergency schedule a substance based on the opinion of a few critics is totally and completely irresponsible in a progressive democratic society.  The community would appreciate a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the issue.  Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9193","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Michelson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nI whole-heartedly support a permanent ban, not a delay, on kratom.  \n\nWe should not further criminalize drug use that has proven medicinal qualities.  \n\nBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nWith an incoming presidential administration that's looking more hostile to equitable drug policies by the day, it's imperative for us to make the most of this opportunity to stop the senseless criminalization of millions more people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shannon Markley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use it for sleep ,I got a hip replacement and took some Lortabs and OxyContin as prescribed ,never took more than I was supposed to it took me a week of feeling like crap to get off of them,  i,didnt know about katrom,  then I had sleep probiems started with amben it didn't work doubled up on it didn't work. got prescribed 2 more kinds of sleeping pillsthey didn't work then I got some katrom in the mail and it relaxed me in 15 min.to were I could drift off to sleep the kind I use is red bali","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4982","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"MIKE TRAYNOR","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am NOT in favor of making kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance.

I was (or supposedly am) a recovering alcoholic (hospitilized), and also suffer from deep depression and anxiety. I have been sober for nearly 8 years now. The doctors had prescribed many medications to control my anxiety such as Zoloft and Valium, among others. The DAY I discovered Kratom was the LAST day I took a drink of alcohol or needed the prescribed medications for my depression and anxiety. I also had NO DESIRE to drink either!! With a cup of Kratom tea, I have been able to COMPLETLY control my anxiety (especially social anxiety), and have found I no longer needed the Zoloft either!! My depression was totally gone, and to this day has not returned. ALL the prescribed drugs previously mentioned have VERY real undesirable side effects, while the Kratom tea has none. This is the most beneficial and life giving plant that God ever created! I have found that there is NO tolerance buildup (as is not the case for the prescriptions). I use the same dosage daily that I did 8 years ago. I have been given my life back! I was on a VERY self destructive path, and my recovery is ALL due to Kratom.  I am also a type II diabetic and have found kratom tea very effective in reducing my blood sugar and keeping my A1C in check.\n   I fully understand that the profits of many big drug manufacturers will be adversely affected by allowing the public unrestricted access to this plant, but PLEASE let's keep our priorities straight.

The quality of my life has improved drastically since I started consuming Kratom on the birth of my first daughter 20 months ago.\n\nPrior to discovering Kratom, I was mentally and emotionally unstable due to my addiction to alcohol and prescription pain medication and cigarettes.  My addiction consumed my life and I became dependent on the alcohol and drugs to just be able to function on a day to day basis.  I was an angry and  a terrible human being if i did not drink or be high on pain killers.  I was emotionally unstable and was always confrontational with family, friends and co-workers because of my addiction.  When I learned that my wife was pregnant with our first child, I was desperate to make a change.  The joy of becoming a father motivated me to become a better person.  I knew I had to be sober.\n\nBecoming sober was more difficult than I had imagined.  The anger, irritability and depression snuffed out my will to remain sober.  I would relapse and chase down pain meds illegally and drown my sobriety in alcohol.  The guilt of being drunk and high pushed me to stop for a few days, but i would find myself chasing down more alcohol and pain killers to combat the irritability and depression.  My effort to become sober was a cycle of success and failures, until i discovered Kratom.\n\nKratom helped to uplift my mood and prevented me from falling into a state of depression and anger which always jerked me back into a life of drugs and alcohol.  Kratom provided me with a surge of positive energy and enhanced my mood.  It replaced the irritability and depression that was responsible for my failure to stay sober.  Kratom filled me with a subtle, but positive and effective energy that allowed me to maintain my sobriety.  I no longer have the urge to drink or take pain medication.  My mind is clear.  My heart is joyful.  I'm at peace for the first time in over 20 years.  Kratom has made it possible for me to be a better man for my family.  I'm proud to say that \"I am Kratom\".\n\nPlease consider all the benefits of this amazing plant  that has helped millions of people change their life for the better by becoming productive members of society.  People all over the planet are benefiting from the properties of Kratom.  I have never been \"high\" from Kratom.  It is impossible to get \"high\" from Kratom.  Kratom is a natural plant that simply provides positive energy to help people stay focus on becoming the best person they can be.  I truly believe that Kratom has made a positve impact in the world and will continue to help people regain control of their life.

It came at just the right time since I was battling servere pain from kidney problems, arthritis,  and a previously broken leg.  I am not into pain pills or other narcotics since I have family and friends who have struggled with addiction to them and I have been strong enough to not follow in their foot steps.  I was willing to try kratom because of how natural and simple it is,   ,how it has not been reported to have deadly overdoses associated with it, and people can still function in their daily lives while using it and not get sleepy or feel high. I bought liquid extracts and they worked great.  I only had to take a small sip once a week  for my pain and the pain relief would hold for a week, or even two before I would have to take another sip. The green leaf Maywood even helped even out my body pH levels and helped my diabetic acidosis.  Since experiencing the benefits of kratom, I have spread the word of it to family, friends, and even  strangers dealing with pain and/or hooked on narcotic pain pills, heroin, and methadone. They have all been thankful for the awareness and have experienced the benefits as well. Kratom should not be classified as a schedule 1 narcotic because you can't get high off of it like narcotics.  It's just a simple opioid with caffeine.    In conclusion,  kratom is a safe alternative to dangerous narcotics.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5768","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"shawn wood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI feel the drug Kratom needs to be further researched for the medical benefits it provides before any sort of classification is applied to it.\n\nGood day,\nBob Iannotti Jr","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10754","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ROBERT IANNOTTI JR","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 38 year old female who uses Kratom to manage chronic pain.

I have taken it for three years and it has been extremely useful in allowing me to work a strenuous job and take care of my family. After a bad car accident in 2009 I was put in pain management and supplied monthly with a hefty dose of opiates. At first it was helpful but eventually it almost cost me my family. The opiates left me in a fog all the time and I began to spiral out of control. After 3 years of prescribed use I lost my job, crashed my car and missed my daughter's important surgery as a direct result of the painkillers I was taking. I was given an ultimatum by my wife to get off pain pills or get a divorce. I have 4 children who I love and cherish and the answer was easy: to discontinue taking opiate medication. I was tapered by method of  Suboxone and I successfully quit the pain medication. However the results of my car accident came glaringly back into my life. I was in so much pain and discomfort that I was pretty much useless. I spent most of the day in the shower or in bed trying to catch up on lost sleep from pain. This went on for months after my taper and I started to become really depressed. I thought about taking pain meds again but realized that wasn't a viable option. I had had years of physical therapy including acupuncture, trigger point injections, coritozone injections and chiropractic visits. They could not relieve the pain I was in. So in desperation I tried to find something natural that wasn't addicting and wouldn't ruin my life. That's when I found kratom. Having been on daily on 4 morphine, 6 Norco and 6 baclofin I was well aware of how opiates affected me. When I began to use kratom I could find no comparison between the two. It helps my mild to moderate pain with no inebriation and no craving to keep wanting to dose. It does fall short of my acute severe flair ups but helps it to be more manageable. I have e now been working for two and a half years straight with no late shows or absents. My employer took me back after I explained I had been on opiates before and that was why I was extremely unreliable. I was graciously given a second chance and I have been productive, reliable and responsible. I can only attribute this to kratom as it's the only thing I take. My pain is manageable and I am able to focus on my job and my family. My wife thinks ita a godsend considering the hell she was forced to live in during my time on Rx pain meds. Recently she had a hysterectomy and had a difficult time refilling her Rx pain meds because the surgeon wanted her dr to fill it but the dr refused to get back with her and place the order. She took powdered kratom leaf in gel capsules to help ease the pain of her incisions and insides. It helped her to get through weeks of pain and discomfort. She stopped taking it with no problems what so ever. Though it is anecedotal evidence to use it is fact. Kratom has been very beneficial to our lives. We have had no negative impacts from taking it and a ban would be very harmful to our family. Please reconsider this action and be aware of the reality for many people who it has benefited. I and many I know would be willing to undergo examination to document the positive effects it has had with minimal negatives. Don't let my children lose their father to pain and depression because of sensationalized media stories. The truth is kratom has helped many many people suffering from chronic pain, and the evidence shows prolonged opiate use has far more negative effects than positive. You are well aware of the negative effects of Rx pain meds as the supply has been reduced , the process to get prescribed has been tightened and the scrutiny  of those prescribing is high. Let us responsible adults take our leaf in peace and enjoy being able to live life freely not burdened by pain.

I experience debilitating chronic pain, chronic fatigue and when I'm in a state of anaphylaxis, I experience severe anxiety. In my city, no doctors knows of it and the treatment I get is extremely limited and of very little use.\n\nKratom allows me to be functional. Without it, I can barely get around, let alone do the most basic tasks most people take for granted like cleaning or even showering.\n\nI have been using kratom almost daily for three years now, as of yet I have not experienced an increase in tolerance.\n\nI urge you to reconsider putting kratom as a Schedule I substance, preventing it from being studied. It helps so many people with debilitating diseases and seems so promising in terms of studies.\n\nFurthermore, the notice of intent filed by the DEA to temporarily designate Kratom (specifically its alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine) as a schedule 1 drug listed 33 footnotes/references, but the actual references themselves were not included in the document.\n\nSince, a FOIA request for all of the data and documents referenced in the 33 footnotes has been submitted, but was denied. This is extremely worrisome. If the data behind the apprehensions of the DEA are solid, why not have them open to social commentary?\n\nWhen there are substances like cigarettes and alcohol available to any adult, substances that have no medicinal value whatsoever and who can provoke well documented severe health issues, it is hard to fathom the reasons that could motivate the DEA to classify a fairly harmless substance like kratom Schedule I without fearing something more nefarious is at work, something else than the well being of the American citizens.\n\nPlease, in my name and the name of all people who suffer daily from terrible maladies, do not take away this precious plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7344","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Isabelle Chaloult","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Writing this letter to let you know I am a strong supporter of kratom. Kratom saved my life and gave me a normal life back. It is not dangerous and not addicitive at all compared to prescription opiates. I am a 30 year old recreation therapist who works for the VA hospital. I was started on perscription opiates at 22 years old for back pain. I became addicted in a few years and started seeking out opiates on the street as my supply from the doctor was no longer helping. When i finally reached my low point and began looking for a way out of the pain of opiate withdrawal i found kratom. It helped get me off the perscriptions and now helps me manage my back pain. Many Americans will begin dying when they run out of their kratom if it is made illegal and turn to opiates from either doctors (pills) or the street for heroin. Kratom helped me get off of deadly oxycotin. The opioid epidemic is real and kratom can help those people heal. Thank you for your time and help. As I mentioned before I work at the VA with veterans in a PTSD program and I see the affects of opiate and prescription abuse first hand. I have lost an ex boyfriend and another great friend due to heroin. Please help by researching how this plant can help end the opioid crisis. \n\nSincerely, \n\nJessica Conyers","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Conyers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We don't need the DEA to criminalize a plant that is helping Americans maintain their health.

Green Zombie and Super red Suma. At 10 my sister and I went to vote, took 15 almost to park... An hour plus of standing in line At 30 minutes my back started hurting by 45 minutes it got to a 6, by the time we got to the car I was at a 7. Normally on two tramadol I would have had 10-15 minutes, at the end of that time its severe and about a 7 plus. The pain going from my back down to my hips and down the front of my right thigh. I refused to sit down, I was starting to sweat and the trembling never started. My sister said I was moaning but I don't remember. BUT I made it so much longer, I am so amazed. I got home and took just the red and it knocked me out, which wasn't hard as I was up all night. OBTW, I was able to do a quick trip in Walmart too!**\n\nThat was my Facebook post from October 28, 2016\n\nThat was also the first time since early 2013 that I have stood or walked so long. I was completely amazed and happy. I have been taking Tramadol over two years and was taking 6 a day and never got relief like that. Even in the beginning I never did. After my surgery on Oxycontin I got some time like that but not once I was off of it.\n\nI never wanted to be on a heavy pain medication, Hydrocodone was too hard for me. I did not like Lyrica either. For pain/depression I was on 900mg of Neurontin, 90mg Cymbalta, 6 50mg Tramadol a day.  I slept almost 16 plus hours a day and when I was awake I was a zombie. I was confused, I couldn't put complete sentences together. I stayed depressed and suicidal.\n\nI have weaned off the Tramadol, tapered down the Neurontin to 300mg at night and Cymbalta to 40mg at night. I am in a lot more pain but mentally more stable and more alert. I can talk like a normal person mostly now too. \n\nI tried Kratom for my pain and it worked amazingly, better than I hoped for.  It worked on my pain without messing with my head. It did not leave me tired and fatigued.\n\nI have degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis in L3, L4 L5, had two laminectomies in L4, L5, 4 herniated disks, ostepenia , arthritis of the spine, degenerative spondylolisthesis, L4 & L5 are at a grade 1 as of last year. I have chronic migraines, I was shot in the head when I was 15 years old, bone fragments and bullet fragments still in. I have a deviated septum that causes chronic sinusitis. I have cubital tunnel and carpel tunnel in my right arm, just carpel in the left arm, TmJ, tinnitus, diabetes.\n\nAs a chronic pain patient I never wanted a heavy narcotic or opiate and Kratom fills that bill. Tramadol, Cymbalta, Neurontin, Lyrica and Hydrocodone have all messed with my mental abilities and left me tired. I do not even drink alcohol. \n\nPlease leave us this natural option!\n\nSincerely,\n\nKelly Ann Bortner","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3438","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kelly Bortner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a parent of an opioid addicted family member I am writing to request my government not to ban the drug Kratom.

Same with the ultimate PLANT known to man, cannabis. The only reason for this is to eliminate natural remedies for certain human conditions to allow the pharmaceutical companies and politicians to monopolize what a free human can ingest which ultimately lines their pockets. The prison system is then also funded by this as more individual free humans are locked up for ingesting a natural plant. True motives are shown when a group of elite individuals with numerous resources and power control and criminalize a P L A N T! A PLANT! Think about this !........a PLANT! Every free human being should have the right to ingest any substance, especially a PLANT, that they so desire. It is their body, their choice and their God given freedom. The govt has done their very best to demonize, liable and criminalize cannabis, the safest (ZERO deaths in the history of the world and proven to be nonlethal) most useful plant known to man (over 50,000 uses including stunting cancer growth) , and now this with Kratom.

Despite an excellent doctor and treatment with methotrexate and lefludimide I am still in considerable pain, especially when it is cold and rainy (like today). Until I tried kratom (at the urging of a friend who also has chronic pain) the only thing that relieved my pain at all was Vicodin. I didn't want to become addicted, or develop a tolerance and so I tried to restrict my use of Vicodin to times that were absolutely necessary. The result was a lot of missed work so I could lie in bed, crying from the pain.\n\nKratom relieves my pain almost as well as Vicodin. I take it maybe three a week, but it has allowed me to cut my opiate use by about 75% and still function. If it was made illegal I would have to go back to taking Vicodin 3-5 times a week, instead of the current once a week at most. I THOUGHT we had an opiate addiction problem and therefore the DEA would welcome a natural, non-addictive alternative. I don't know why the DEA is considering treating kratom like heroin. But if it is made illegal, it will be the DEA's fault if I end up addicted to opiates, since it will be the DEA that took away the only alternative I've found that works.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15134","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Annalisa Castaldo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a __ year old female who uses kratom for Fibromyalgia and for mood stabilzation as I have also been diagnosed as Bipolar.

I am 68 years old and I would like to share my experience with kratom. I have never taken it myself, but I believe that it should be made available to anyone who finds it useful. My son was in a terrible car accident years ago. He had many corrective surgeries and has suffered with pain ever since. The pain got to a level that he needed some sort of relief to be able to function as a normal person and to sleep. Norcos were really the only thing that worked consistently. Everything was fine for awhile, but the thing with opiates is you keep needing to take more and more for the same effect. At a certain point, the negatives outweigh the positives. But at this point youre dependent on them and its very difficult to stop. \n   During this time, I could tell that something was off. The light in his eyes just wasnt there anymore and I could tell he was depressed. He stopped hanging out with friends and family more and more. I didnt know what the problem was, but I should have pressed him harder. At one point he finally asked me for help and it all made sense. \n   I asked a friend of mine who had a son that suffered from addiction. She was the one who told me about kratom. After a couple weeks, I could see an immediate difference in my son. He said it helped the chronic pain about as well as the opiates did, but with minimal side effects. I am no doctor, but I could see the difference with my own eyes. I had my son back and all because of a simple plant.  \n   When I heard that the DEA announced they were going to ban this plant and make it schedule I, I thought it must be a mistake. With the problems that this country has with opiates, it is unbelievable that anyone would even consider doing this. Banning kratom will take it away from all the people who have turned their lives around from its use. Why would you ban something that has killed no one to force people back on something that we know does? At one point when we were talking about it, my son broke down and cried. He feared that this would ruin the rest of his life.\n   I do have hope though. The fact that you are taking comments and listening to the public in this matter is encouraging to me. It makes sense that you thought kratom was just a legal high sold in gas stations, and you didnt know the real side of it. Please listen to what thousands of us are saying and take advantage of this opportunity to study kratom and learn more about it. If it is proven to be dangerous, then I do not want my son to be taking it. But considering that in 2014, prescription opiates killed more than 14,000 people alone, I think the answer is obvious. You now have the opportunity to do the right thing and make a difference in this country. For the sake of my son and millions of others like him, please keep kratom a legal supplement available to all.

I was diagnosed with a severe case of restless leg syndrome, a symptom of a neurological disorder. I have been prescribed medication solely made for RLS, however it is only effective for a short amount of time. I was then prescribed tramadol, which took care of it, but it has severely addictive properties and even worse withdrawal symptoms. I got pregnant 2 years ago with my first child, and my PCP told me I had to stop taking it. I asked her for an alternative, however they did not offer one and expected me to stop cold turkey (which can be very harmful to the body, and cause seizures). When I spoke with my ob/gyn, Sh le told me that tramadol is not addictive. My RLS became unbearable. I had heard about Kratom, and decided to try it. To my surprise, it completely relieved my RLS. I was getting about 2 hours of broken sleep during the period of not taking anything, but with the relief I got from Kratom, I was able to get a full night's sleep and have exhaustion not interfere with my job (I work in an emergency department). The only other things that will relieve RLS are opiates, and I did not want to risk taking those and becoming addicted. Kratom is in no way like the drugs that are currently considered schedule 1 substances; it does not give me any sort of \"high\", because if it did I would be unable to do my job which requires a clear mind and my full attention. I just recently gave birth a week and a half ago, was given Tylenol 3, which provided no relief from the postpartum pains. Taking Kratom has not only relieved my RLS, but also the cramping I have been experiencing. \n\nPlease consider doing more research on Kratom, instead of banning it altogether based on poorly gathered evidence (patients who have passed while taking it, because in the 15 cases mentioned, they were on other substances as well). Kratom is a very helpful supplement that needs to be studied, not banned.

I ordered a small bit to see if it would help, and since I had no insurance for the first time in my life, going to the Drs. wasn't an option.

It is FAR safer AND more effective than legal substances like alcohol and tobacco, as well as EVERY single prescription medication used for similar conditions (oxycodone, paxil, Prozac, valium, Xanax, etc.)  Why would we prevent the American population from a safer more productive life?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15803","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rich Ferrara","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To  whom it may concern,\n Please keep kratom legal.

I am gainfully employed and I also go to school full time while maintaining a 3.8 GPA. A little background regarding why I started taking Kratom. I used to be a heroin addict and wasnt doing anything to be productive in society. Actually I was doing the opposite. Ive almost lost my life due to the depression that is accompanied by the use of heroin. Why should I go on living like this? My family disowned me especially my father. One day I came home to him telling me that I was kicked out of the house because I had stolen money from him. This was the last straw for him and he offered to drive me to a homeless shelter. This hit me hard and I made a decision that I was done with heroin. I called rehab facilities trying to find a bed open. No one seemed to have a bed open unless you had insurance, which I did; the only problem is that I had maxed out my mental health insurance because I had been fighting this disease of addiction for the past 4 years, spending time in and out of rehabs. All of them were telling me that I had to wait at least 30 days before they could get me in through the state. I finally found a rehab that would accept me but I had to pay for room and board, which was still $500 a week. I was in this particular rehab for almost 2 months and was on suboxone maintenance while I was in there. Around 10 days before they were to release me, I made the decision to stop taking suboxone because I didnt want to have to go through the withdraws outside of rehab. I didnt know if I would be able to do it without relapsing. I was released on January 10, 2014 and most of the withdraws were gone but noticed that I kept getting very bad headaches everyday.  One day I woke up with a different kind of headache. It felt like my head was being pierced by a hot metal rod and squeezed in a vice at the same time. I tried to sleep it off but was in sooooo much pain that I decided to go to the emergency room. They gave me some medication and released me without a diagnosis. The next day the same feeling came back and I ended up back at the emergency room again. Within those two weeks I was having headaches almost every single day, so I was forced to search for alternative ways to help with headaches. That is how I became familiar with Kratom. With the exercises that the emergency room doctor explained for me to do and consuming kratom, I was able to almost eliminate my headaches completely. There were some times that the headaches were there but for the most part they were gone. Back to the primary care physician. She had looked me over and came to the conclusion that I needed to go see a neurologist. I was written a referral to see a neurologist.I got it done and they forgot to scan me without the dye in my body so I actually had to have 2 MRIs done. The first one had an abnormal looking spot on it so they wanted me to get some blood work done, which I did and the major issues were ruled out. Thank God. The neurologist finally came to the conclusion that I was having migraines. Ummm no duh!! About $5000 later I got the answer that I already knew. The neurologist had prescribed me a blood pressure medication which I couldnt take because of all the side effects such as drowsiness, ED, dizziness, and vertigo.  I believe that without this supplement I would still be having those migraines, which I cannot afford to have because of school and work. An added bonus to consuming Kratom is that I am more active now and have lost some fat due to being able move around more, and am able to tolerate the pain in my knees. If this plant is taken away from us, it will do more harm than good. With the opiate epidemic out of control this country needs every little tool, every little stepping stone to get us out of it. By scheduling this plant, you are taking one of the most effective tools away from my and thousands of other people's hands. Just because it touches the opioid receptors you want to label it as harmful and an imminent threat to society. I have to disagree. I was very skeptical when I first started researching it, because I am an ex heroin addict and the image that was in the public eye was that it is a harmful drug. I can assure you that I wont go and rob someone to get kratom. I can assure you that I wont steal items from a store to pawn off for kratom. I dont want to have to go see a doctor to get prescribed something that is natural and effective for my needs. I havent found a better solution to my problem. I dont want to have to start over again, and possibly not find a solution. Keep this natural plant legal and add age limits, come up with a solution to this, where it has to be screened for adulterants and regulate it within reason, but to schedule it will do nothing but create another black market item and potentially create thousands of felons out of a society that seems to be mostly responsible consumers.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1424","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Penn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Simply put, it is objectively illogical to ban a plant as benign as Kratom. There is no legitimate reason to declare this substance as a greater danger than Methamphetamine. The true reason this is even being discussed is blatant - thousands have weaved off of prescription Opiates (which, by this logic, should be scheduled even more vigorously than Kratom) using Kratom, as it's mechanism of action takes place in the opioid receptors - to a much lesser degree than pharmaceuticals. The saddening reality is that their fight to vilify Kratom with their monetary influence has taken the large corporations this far. I truly hope that you, the reader, takes a good hard look at studies from a variety of sources. As long as a nonbiased comprehensive analysis is achieved, there is no doubt in my mind this Scheduling will be retracted. However, if the DEA does move forward in scheduling, the true priorities will be painfully obvious to the American people (which, I may add will lead to thousands of opiate addicts relapsing and even dying. Death that YOU could have prevented simply by truly evaluating the 'dangers' of the plant.). All I can truly hope for at this point is the overwhelming voice of the people will not be drowned out by the few that would benefit from the ban.

Kratom has been shown to  help numerous addicts find a safe alternative off of the particularly deadly opiates. They have been able to resume a normal life and achieve their life goals because of this plant. This plant that has not been proven that dying from overdose is possible. Also, Kratom is an amazing alternative to people that have pain management programs their whole life. People that have to take prescriptions of deadly opiates such as Oxycodone and hydrocodone, are now able to take Kratom to help allieviate their pain and can cut back or completely stop their need for taking opiate prescriptions. And this doesn't mean the pharmaceutical industry is going to lose their income seeing how everyone is taking Kratom. Because it doesn't help some people, people in surgeries still need stronger painkillers, etc. I live in Washington a marijuana legal state and I find kratom incredibly similar to marijuana. I cannot personally smoke marijuana which could help potentially with my chronic pain and anxieties except the reality is some people cannot smoke marijuana. Instead of helping with anxieties like it does for alot of people marijuana increases my anxieties 10 fold. Which is why I take kratom. It helps so much with my back pain and anxieties without me having to fear a hardcore addiction coming from it. This plant has been used for 1000s of years in Asian culture to help opium addicts, and help with pain without having to use the poppy plant. I believe we should keep kratom legal. I believe there should be an age requirement on it for those using it recreationally just like marijuana has one here. I believe you should be 21 to purchase kratom just like marijuana and alcohol.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8495","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason King Snaza","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement without the mortality associated with opoid use.

Though I took my Doctors advice and stayed on these medications for the better part of a decade - the positives only barely outweighed the negatives (terrible side effects that I forced myself to cope with, including ongoing issues with my testicles that ultimately cost me my sex-life (yes, I'm 24 years old and wasn't sexually active for most of the last 5 years). Out of all the medications my Doctor had me try, the ones which I stayed on still had these terrible side effects. I had no other options. Since discovering Kratom I was able to safely substitute this for all of my Rx medications. \n\nOnce again, I can't stress enough how safe and sound of a plant this is. \nThe proof is crystal clear how beneficial this plant is and the safety profile couldn't be any safer.  It is extremely low risk.  It is barely any different than green tea.  I make tea out of this every morning to start my day. I consider myself a very productive member of society. \n\nIt is clear that this plant is understudied.  Future studies Will confirm the safety profile of this plant. Given how safe it is, people deserve the right to make tea out of this Kratom as they please.  I used to drink a pot of coffee a day and take 5 medications before 9am, but now I have 2 cups of tea in place of all of that. Simply banning this plant would lack simple logic. \n\nI can't stress enough how safe and sound of a plant kratom is. \nIt has changed the lives of tens of thousands of people in the United States - and it will continue doing so for many years to come.

Kratom has been enormously helpful to me during my recovery from heroin and methamphetamine addiction.  Using Kratom has allowed me to deal proactively with my periods of craving and withdrawal from what are known to be dangerous drugs.  I've been sober for 21 months.  Before going to rehab, I was sober for maybe a handful of days during a span of about 18 years.  I had A LOT of adjustments to make in my thinking and how I related to the world.  Kratom has helped me feel 'normal' and has allowed me to meet the many challenges of newly found sobriety with strength and minimal emotional and physical discomfort.  I used Suboxone, under medical orders, during my initial phase of acute withdrawal; it helped enormously, but was not ideal for me for long term use.  Suboxone negatively affected my memory, sex-drive and emotional state.  Being on Suboxone for an extended length of time was nearly as troublesome as being back on heroin.  With Kratom, I experience NONE of the side-effects I had with Suboxone.  Kratom is nothing short of miraculous.  The only negative effects I've experienced from Kratom came from when I first began taking it, and being inexperienced, I took too much.  The result?  Nausea that lasted for a couple of hours, that's it.  Comparing the effects of Kratom to the effects of hard drugs is GROSSLY INACCURATE.  Hard drugs kill.  For that matter, caffeine kills, tobacco kills, alcohol kills- people even die from misusing sugar or water.  The dose makes the poison.\nScheduling Kratom will help no one.

This herbal remedy relieves my symptoms without the troublesome side effects I experience with pharmaceutical alternatives.

I use it 3-4 times daily. It's a helpful addition to my day, one I've grown reliant upon, but I do not suffer the withdrawals some associate with pharmaceutical pain killers or other drugs and I have certainly never OD'd nor known anyone who has. \n\nMany states, after evaluating all of the facts, have elected to keep Kratom legal, most recently North Carolina where lawmakers voted unanimously to only ask for an age restriction. It appears that the states and the DEA are in disagreement about the imminent danger of this herb.\n\nWhile the \"opiate epidemic\" is worrisome, this overreach by the DEA is tone deaf and unhelpful.

I dont personally use kratom or any other substances for that matter but I have a close relative who struggles with drug addiction. My sister has overdosed on opiates twice and is currently frequenting a methadone clinic. The problem with the clinic is that its incredibly expensive and its only open during regular work hours. Im not sure if this is the case with all methadone clinics but the one in her local area is only open for a very specific window of time. Sometimes her job interferes with her ability to make it to the clinic in the morning. This is where kratom comes in. She will take some kratom, not sure of the dosage but its a lot more affordable than the methadone. The kratom gets her through the day. Then the next day she makes sure to get to the clinic on time if at all possible.  I dont think she could have went directly from hard opiates to kratom but I do think that kratom could help her quit the methadone clinic. Which would in turn save her lots of money and maybe she could afford to get her son back. I believe that if kratom is made illegal my sister will either relapse on one of the days she misses the clinic or lose her job because she had to leave or come in late to make it to the clinic. Either way without kratom I dont expect shell be able to straighten out her life enough to regain custody of her child.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15492","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Baker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 27-year-old female who has struggled with depression and anxiety throughout my whole life. My family spent hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars in attempts to find different psychiatrists different medications that might make my quality of life something I could enjoy. Then in college I was diagnosed with Endometriosis. \n\nOnce a month I found myself in absolute agony for at least 5-days during my menstrual cycle and was taken to the hospital several times a year for being in so much pain I couldn't function properly. Even the laparoscopy I had done was a very temporary fix that ended up not working. Eventually my doctor proscribed me Tylenol 3 to help deal with the pain. I thought I had found the miracle drug that would finally allow me to live my life uninterrupted. But then I'd build a tolerance to them and they'd stop helping. So then he gave me percocets. Then oxycodone. \n\nEventually my life had become focused around pills and getting more of them. They were the closest things I'd felt to happiness and I wanted that badly. Those days were the most miserable days of my life. I was an opiate addict. I let those painkillers ruin my life for a few years until I finally forced myself off of them and decide I'd rather just live with the pain than be addicted to something. \n\nEventually I graduated, barely, and immediately moved back home with my parents and lived in pain, getting more and more depressed as I went through antidepressants that wouldn't work and dealing with constant cramps. I'd given up on things getting better. I often considered moving onto harder drugs since I knew I couldn't get painkillers anymore, but I hated that idea. There were several times where I honestly considered just ending my life. I was miserable and i was making the people around me miserable. \n\nUntil my mom suggested I try some tea she'd read about on the internet. That was Kratom, and that was 4 years ago. The last 4 years have been the best of my life, because I feel like I can finally live it... I drink a cup in the morning and a cup at night, and that's all it takes. Because of Kratom my depression and anxiety are under control. I've since moved out, gotten a job as a piano teacher, cleaned up my act and am able to say I'm happy for the first time in years. I don't need to take any pain killers for my cramps anymore, and the idea that I once considered moving onto something much deadlier before I found this plant scares me so much. \n\nKratom has quite literally saved my life, and I know I'm not the only one who has had this experience. I've never experienced any negative side effects. Taking away this tea would be taking away my ability to live a happy, pain-free, and productive life.

I first discovered Kratom in early 2004 while looking for an alternative to narcotic pain medication for treating chronic lower back pain and arthritis. At that time it was relatively unknown in the US and identified as being from the coffee family. I began using Kratom at that time and found that it actually was helpful for pain relief with none of the side effects of opiod pain meds. It is not a substance that has ever resulted in my being intoxicated. In smaller amounts it is mildly stimulating at best similar to coffee. In higher doses it may be somewhat relaxing, however I can emphatically state it is not at all comparative to prescription drugs I have used in the past such as opiods, tranquilizers, sedatives, etc..- I have seen this misinformation in the media and unless it is somehow being tainted with other substances or drugs plain kratom is nothing like those drugs. It has been almost 13 years of my using kratom, and the past 7 include regular and almost daily doses. I am very active and also extremely health conscious. I have regular medical check ups and lab work done every six months for thyroid/cholesterol as well as liver/kidney function and all tests have been in normal range. I have had two shoulder surgeries in the past 5 years and used kratom rather than opiod medication throughout the recovery. I must really emphasize that kratom does not impair you and something like Benadryl has a much more sedating effect than kratom in my experience. Although the significant benefits of Kratom are considered mostly anecdotal I have seen it proven to be nothing short of miraculous in saving several people I know personally from long term and severe addictions when no other treatments had been successful. It saved their lives. Please do not schedule this drug as planned. It has benefitted myself greatly but even more importantly it has actually saved, and will save the lives of so many others, especially with the current opiod crisis in this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4707","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant is a miracle, I imagine I would still be doing heroin if I hadn't found this alternative.

I am not trying to beat a heroine habit.  I'm a software engineer who suffers from chronic back pain.  I don't like to take acetaminophen because it's very bad for the liver, and I also hate to take ibuprofen because it gives me stomach aches.  A nurse friend of mine recommended that I try an herbal solution - kratom.  I rolled my eyes at the time because I assumed that a plant couldn't offer me any real pain relief.. otherwise I would have heard about it by now, right?  \n\nI take two caplets in the morning and two after lunch, and my back pain is gone.  Incidentally, I also found that it was a more effective stimulant than coffee, which offers much more severe side effects.  I have been living caffeine and pain free since I discovered this supplement and I am truly floored by the idea that we are even considering a ban.\n\nI had no idea that my government could reach into my cupboard and unceremoniously decide for me that I should have to live with liver damage, nausea, or back pain... because.. ?  I'm still not clear on the because part of all this.  Because it might act on the brain in similar ways to opiates?  Is this some horrific sin on its own, when it causes no demonstrable harm?  It was my understanding that the privilege of emergency scheduling was afforded to the DEA in order to combat the rapidly produced synthetic drugs that pose a clear and present danger to our public.  This is not happening right now... public opinion on kratom ranges from \"What's that?\" to \"That literally changed/saved my life.\"  The number of deaths that are 'linked' to kratom is laughable to anyone with a college-level statistics class.  \n\nI have done nothing wrong by availing myself of this natural form of pain relief.

The number of people killed by eating dishwasher detergent pods last year is much greater than the number (inconclusively) linked to kratom.  And hey ok.. folks are less likely to want to eat detergent pods so let's get away from the substance itself and talk about usage... You allow us to kill ourselves with alcohol and cigarettes, but you want to forbid us from the mild stimulant/pain reliever offered by kratom.

I can honestly say that without Kratom I would probably be dead, I would be on opioids for my back and I would be drinking to drown the noise in my head.  I can be there for my kids and my family and I'm able to show up for life, because of Kratom.  If Kratom gets banned I am afraid for my life, I am afraid that I will turn to the dark side.  I don't need a fancy degree or a scientist to tell me what I already know about Kratom and it's benefits.  It works and it works well for my issues and is a safe alternative to opioids and benzos.

These medications are somewhat effective at initially controlling a patient's pain, but continued use leads to several problems. The first problem is that the effectiveness is diminished over time. This is because new studies have found that opioid pain medications change the way the spinal cord and brain communicate. Unfortunately the narcotics cause an over sensitization to pain. This means that the patient eventually requires more narcotic medication to adequately control their pain. The patient in turn may be penalized as a 'drug seeker' which is also unfortunate for the patient. The patient is just looking to relieve their pain. A second problem is that a lot of these opioids also contain acetaminophen as an active ingredient. This acetaminophen takes it's toll on the liver, depleting it's supply of glutathione. Glutathione is a critical super antioxidant our body produces to ultimately keep our liver (aka our body's filter) running properly. Patients who take opioids containing acetaminophen for pain management can and eventually will develop liver issues or cirrhosis if use is continued. A third problem to this method of treating pain is that these medications can result in respiratory depression...where the breathing rate slows down and can ultimately be completely suppressed. To translate in layman's term, the patient stops breathing. This can happen in any patient. The patient can be taking it as prescribed and still run into this major problem.  Kratom is an effective pain reliever and does not have these dangerous side effects. I have witnessed a patient take narcotics to no avail of relief while I also witnessed the same patient have significant relief of pain after taking Kratom. This was a patient with multiple herniated discs. The relief was apparent with the Kratom and the effective time of relief  was longer than that of the narcotic opiods.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9919","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"C Allen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I believe that Kratom should not be a schedule-1 narcoic.

I also suffer from GI issues and abdominal pain from multiple hernias and an inoperable hiatal hernia. And I have been taking the herbal supplement known as Kratom for over nine years to help me manage the pain, depression and anxiety that come from having to deal with these issues on a daily basis. \n\nTo be clear, I have tried many doctors. I have undergone painful surgery, and have been prescribed powerful opiate pain killers like Vicodin, hydrocodone, and oxycodone to help me manage my pain. My medicine chest is overflowing with muscle relaxants, and prescription strength naproxyn, diclofenac and other NSAID pain killers. \n\nAll of these drugs come with an assortment of side effects that are well documented by the medical community. And the byproduct of all these medications, make it difficult for me to be an effective provider for my family when I am taking them. The prescription strength nsaids have left me with GI issues that must be treated with PPI drugs like omeprazole (prilosec), and ranitidine on a daily basis. Furthermore, the omeprazole (prilosec) causes me to have chest pain and tachycardia as another side effect. And my cardiologist recommended this year that I discontinue usage of all PPIs in this class. \n\nThis leaves me with very few viable options to treat my pain.  I can take the narcotics and suffer the slow, \"muddy\" thought processes, addiction, constipation, and difficulty breathing that they bring. Or I can take the nsaids and PPIs and suffer through the chest pain, tachycardia, ulcers, gastric reflux and irritation to my hiatal hernia.\n\nOR, I can take an all natural, and SAFE herbal supplement like Kratom that comes with NONE of these symptoms. I can choose to take low doses of this herbal supplement that has been used to treat pain for thousands of years and that has been proven to be safe and effective by the community of people who have used it as part of their traditional medicine.\n\nI have worked for the same company for over thirteen years. I am well respected by my customers, colleagues and my management in this company. And I have been responsibly using Kratom for almost ten of those years now - WITHOUT any of the complications or issues with addiction that have been reported in the news recently. Certainly nothing like the horror stories and narrative currently being pushed on the public by the DEA and FDA.\n\nKratom is a plant that comes from the same family as the coffee plant and is no more addictive than your morning cup of coffee. If this ban is ratified after December 1st, Kratom could be placed in the same class as HEROIN. At that point, the DEA and law enforcement agencies of the US will view me no differently then a Heroin-using street junky. I could go to jail!  Just for wanting to treat my own pain with a safe, herbal alternative to the powerful prescriptions that cause me horrible side-effects.\n\nI have been responsibly taking this amazing herbal supplement for almost a decade, and I do not drink alcohol, or smoke, or use illegal drugs. I do not even like to take prescription painkillers. Every morning, I get up, pain or no pain, and I go to work to provide for my three little girls. Because that is what a good Father - not a JUNKY - does for his family. I pay my taxes, I obey the laws of my country, and I am a productive, honest employee. And now the US government could classify me as a felon - in the same category as a Heroin addict? That is ludicrous!\n\nWhat is needed at this time is an EXTENDED period of responsible discussion with the medical community to properly address the debatable claims of negative side effects and rumors of danger to the public. The medical and scientific community need to be given time (and the funding) to properly research this amazing herbal supplement. What we do NOT need is a knee-jerk reaction to ban this herb due to the few debatable claims of death and addiction that have been associated with its use.\n\nIF, it is determined that some form of regulation is required during this period of discussion and research, then let's work together to find something less draconian then requiring a prescription or an outright banning.  For example, we could restrict the sale of the herb to minors - much the same as we do for OTC medicines, tobacco and alcohol. Furthermore, many of us in the community would welcome some form of quality control to ensure product safety for human consumption. The integrity of tobacco and alcohol products is currently maintained by the Alcohol And Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.  Why not do the same for herbs like Kratom?\n\nThere are so many other productive options that we could take instead of an outright scheduling or banning of this herbal supplement. Please keep the sale of this herb legal to adults and responsible individuals such as myself who depend on it for their daily activities and livelihoods.\n\nThanks!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6559","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Tatman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi please keep kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10745","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zsolt Kis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom allows me to alleviate my back pain without any real significant side effects.

I've experienced debilitating anxiety, trouble sleeping, and depression for over a decade. My life took a drastic turn about 5 years ago after a failed marriage and another dangerous bout with my addiction. At unequivocally the worst point in my life I found myself looking deep inside and wondering weather or not I would ever be able to turn my life around for the better. I had tried every recovery option known to man from abstinence based programs to maintenance programs. While researching yet another option I read about Kratom and decided to try it with very little belief that it would be able to help me. I had no idea that within a week or two this little known plant from Southeast Asia would have me looking towards the future with true hope and believe that I would be able to turn my life around for the better. I stopped smoking cigarettes, using any drugs or alcohol, and began eating better and working out within weeks. In the months after the first experience I lost about 70 pounds and have continued to work out to this day. I cannot speak on behalf of anyone else, but this plant literally changed my life. More importantly it saved my life. It wasn't a magic bullet but rather a vehicle to help me get to a more stable place where I could become a responsible productive member of society. I now do something I absolutely love to do and have not had a single relapse since my first experience with Kratom. My anxiety is tolerable, and my sleep patterns are the best they've been since I was a teenager. Kratom is not for everyone, but very little in this world is. Personally I believe regulation would be best as well as an age limit. The worst thing possible in my opinion would be to ban this life saving herb and put it on a list that makes it incredibly difficult to study and potentially save more lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18844","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Grant Hoover","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps with drug withdraws allowing people to deal with their issues in a  natural way........","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0778","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"john coppeta","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Just don't do it!

Eventually i was able to get clean using Suboxone that a doctor prescribed me. I have over four years sober now. However, at that point i was just addicted to the Suboxone. If I even missed one dose I would have terrible withdrawals.\nSuboxone is known to be very hard to get off of. I've had two different Suboxone doctors tell me there's a very good chance that Ill be on Suboxone for the rest of my life. And they haven't seen anyone get off of it who's been on it for more than a month or so. People also always told me that Suboxone withdrawals are even worse than heroin withdrawals, which I later found to be true.\nKnowing it would be tough, about 6 months ago I attempted to very slowly taper off the Suboxone. At that point I had been on it for almost 4 years. However when i was a few days into the taper, it was just way too hard. I couldn't do it. It was terrible.\nSo I got online to do some research and I joined a \"Suboxone Taper Support\" group on Facebook. Literally EVERYONE was saying that Kratom is by far the best thing to help. I researched Kratom and found nothing negative about it. Its all natural and there has been no overdoses.\nSo I bought some, and started to taper off the Suboxone again, but this time on Kratom. I cant even begin to explain the difference it made. The Suboxone withdrawals weren't too bad at all on Kratom, where without Kratom it was impossible for me. It's amazing.\nI also want to note that I wouldn't consider Kratom to get you \"high\". It does put me in a better mood though. There are no negative effects whatsoever that I got from Kratom.\nHonestly, even if Kratom didn't help people like me out, it would still be ridiculous to make this harmless supplement illegal. But its not just that. If Kratom was illegal, I gaurentee I would still be on Suboxone to this day. Kratom helped me so much and I know I'm not the only one. There will be plenty more people just like me who will need Kratom. Please don't take that away from them.\nThank you so much.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12405","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tyler Owyen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom needs to stay legal, it helps a lot of people and is completely natural! \n\nSincerely, \nDebra Timko","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21827","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Debra Timko","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"   Kratom leaves when used properly are in fact harmless.

I am speaking for thousands of people but I am going to try my best to keep this factual, logical, and on my own person experiences. This is a personal outcry. I ask the DEA to read this with an open mind and a realistic understanding of the situation. My message that I want to articulate are reasons why Mitragyna speciosa, which is a cousin to the coffee plant. Should not be a schedule 1 controlled substance. This letter must be brief so I will do my best to convey my message clearly and logically.\n First I would like to say that I use Mitragna speciosa. It has helped me in my life more then I could ever describe in a short letter. My family will attest to this. I have been on pharmaceuticals since I was a kid for depression, anxiety, adhd, and others. I have struggled with chemical dependency for many years. It all started with the medicines the doctor prescribe for these disorders that I was diagnosed with. It eventually lead to the use of other narcotics. When all hope had seemed lost and I hit my bottom, I seeked help/treatment for the many problems that I was struggling with, including chemical dependency. I did not want to start taking the pharmaceuticals again that led me down a horrible path in the first place. So I turned to Kratom, I used it as an aid throughout multiple step of my road to recover. I would go into further detail about how it help but let's just keep it simple, it helped. I have now been sober(drug and alcohol free) over 6 years. I am finishing up my chemistry/biology degree and am going to persue med school. Through out this whole time from the start of treatment to now finishing up a college degree I have used Kratom for its many benefits. I would not be where I am at without it. In that time I have gone for yearly labs and checkups and have had no deleterious affects.\n Now that I have told you a little about my own expierances I would like to go over some facts as well as logical ideas pertaining to this topic. I would love to give detailed ideas and work cited pages but I do not have enough room in this letter to do so. Let's start at the top. I have just told you how beneficial Kratom as been for me and my life. Tens of thousands of people also attest to the same benefits and many more. Scheduling this as a drug and making this medicinal endemic herb uneccesible to the people and scientist, will cause major strife. You will sever any type of progress for a new medical benefits that could come from this. What if we are able to reduce drug addiction, which is now an epidemic in our nation. As well as have an organic pain/anxiety medicine that does not depress the respitory system to deadly levels. These are all possibliities for this plant. Lets look at how well it went over making marijuana illegal. Or how about prohibition, need I say more about how unsuccessful those cases where. Yet we have a plant that has been shown to have wonderful medicinal properties but our government is saying that it doesn't and are welling to make it uneccesible. As well as charge and incarcerate people if they are in possession, without providing substantial evidence that it is harmful. With that being said lets talk about alcohol, a drug people drink for fun, kills thousands every year, destroys families, and has little to absolutely no medicinal benefits. Yet we are going to incarcerate and patronize a person that is using an organic herb to try an alleviate ailments that they have. But a drunk stumbling fool is considered normal in our society. Lastly there was a time in this country where the idea of our government telling the citizens what they can and can't put in their body would have been absolutely unacceptable. Now a days we just rip the rights of people away. Tell them what they can and cant do. Even if you have no first hand expierances with the benefits of Kratom please see that this is not the American way. Telling people they cant consumer a herb that they find to so beneficial that it has given them their life back and made their life worth living.\n Please I beg of you to look at this with an open mind and take this into consideration. You will not only be saving lives but making people's lives better if you allow this herb to be easily accessible to people. We can find a proper middle ground. Set age laws(like 21+), when proper testing has been done give Information on packaging. Like warnings or proper dosages. Tax it, state and federal. Have fda make a certain standard that needs to be met, such as all organic or of a certain quality and safety. These are some ways that maybe you will find a compromise for the people that need this herb. Thank you for your time and I hope come December 1st you will tell the citizens of the is USA that you are not going to criminalize this wonderful herb.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13863","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In reference to DEA Docket Number 442-W: My name is Kyle Simkins.

This is what I can tell you about Kratom. You CAN NOT get high using Kratom in the raw herb form. A tsp. dose has a mild stimulate effect for about an hour of first taking it which equals to a cup of strong coffee, no more. A tbsp. dose begins acting as a sedative. You CAN NOT overdose on Kratom in the raw herb form. If you happen to take too much you WILL vomit it back up immediately. It  DOES NOT damage your liver, kidneys, heart, etc. Check the thousands of researches that has already been done. It WILL and DOES control pain better than most opiates AND it WILL help you get off of opiates and illegal drugs if you are addicted. When you run out of Kratom there is NO withdrawals like you have with everything else that you would use for pain. You just run out and within a day or two, the pain comes back. It is VERY EFFECTIVE in controlling PTSD, anxiety & depression, just ask my clients. It not only STOPS a migraine but continued timed scheduled use of  Kratom prevents you from having them. I have serious back issues & have had numerous surgeries & once walked with a cane. I no longer do so and unlike opiates that made me feel and act like a zombie, Kratom as given me my life back as well as it has with the numerous clients that I have. When you the DEA announced in Sept that you were going to classify it has a Schedule 1 drug, I called my clients to tell them I could no longer supply them and it brought a few to tears and that broke my heart. I've suffered from migraines since the age of 10 and I am now 58 years old. Since I began taking Kratom my migraines have slowly went away and I haven't had one in over a year now. Yes, I am a better and happier person without having to deal with so much pain and the fear of when the next migraine was coming. I do realize that others mix Kratom with illegal drugs, alcohol & energy shots and drinks and its those idiots that are messing things up for us the users and prescriber's that us it in the raw herb form. I totally understand that, but please DO NOT let those idiots control your decision and please DO NOT take our Kratom away from us. I would be forced to go back on the opiates and I do not want to go back to that miserable life again. So please, please Mr. DEA don't do this to us. \n\nSincerely,\nRuth Hood","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8018","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ruth Hood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing in reference to the recent plan to ban kratom by the DEA.  I am a college educated professional who works in the field of education. I had a serious spinal cord injury in 2008 and due to a heart condition am unable to take traditional opiates. At the time of my injury my heart condition was not yet diagnosed.  I was prescribed vicodin by my doctor after my injury but due to the symptoms I was having with my heart thought I would wait to take the pain meds until I saw my electrocardio physiologist.  My appointment was scheduled weeks ahead so I could only suffer in severe pain until I saw my doctor.  When I saw my heart specialist he told me about the dangers of prescribed opiates with respect to my condition. He also told me that the stress caused by my untreated pain was dangerous for my heart.  I discussed alternative pain med options with him. I found out about kratom not long after my injury and it has helped me in so many ways. \n\nI originally used kratom to help with my PTSD starting in late 2008 and it was clearly a miracle that it not only helped with that, but it also helped ease the extreme pain from my spinal injury. It allowed me to stay a productive working citizen because it kept the pain from my injury at bay and permitted me to keep teaching. I was not forced to take prescribed narcotics that make it impossible to hold down a full time job,  not to mention one that requires a clear thinking brain. We were also able to keep our home which we would have lost without an income.\n\nI had spinal surgery in 2013 and do not need kratom daily for pain but I do use it occasionally to help with other things like my PTSD.  I had no problem stopping kratom and I am convinced it is a safe herb based on my extensive experience using it for many years. According to an article https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161128132148.htm posted by ScienceDaily on November 28th, 2016, kratom may be a safe opioid alternative. These professional opinions must not be overlooked.\n\nDue to the tens of thousands of deaths yearly from opiates, it is totally irresponsible for the DEA or any government agency to ban a plant that has been safely used for thousands of years and has not been directly tied to one death.  I am convinced that if kratom was not available to me, I would have been forced to take prescribed pain meds that would have killed me.  Please do not ban this safe plant because I am convinced that that act alone will kill thousands more a year.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21461","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a hard working mother of 4.

I am currently working on my bachelor's in Philosophy, to further my education by choosing this bachelor's degree for Law School afterwards. When I am not going to school and studying, I am a business owner for a very professional and growing company that my husband started in 2013.\n  I'd also like to start off by voicing my opposition to the DEAs Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin, which Kratom is far from! It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. I appreciate this comment period that is happening, so myself, along with thousands of others can tell our stories about why Kratom should be legal.\n   I became familiar and a true supporter of Kratom at the beginning of the year, 2016, when it changed my life forever and for the better. Due to medical health issues, I became addicted to opiate pain pills that doctors were writing to treat my medical conditions. These opiates were prescribed to me for a couple of years. No one ever thinks that you can get addicted to pain medication when obeying your doctor's orders, and I especially didn't ever think that. Being addicted to pain medicine turned my live upside down and it changed me as a person. I lost relationships, quit school, became unhealthy, and much more. In the beginning of this year, I started doing some research because I wanted desperately out of my addiction and to help my everyday life get back to normal, and so after much research I came across Kratom at a health food store while looking for vitamins to help my health. I saw an elderly couple purchasing it in front of me, and was curious to what it was. Asking about Kratom that day was the best thing I could have ever done. From the moment I began taking Kratom as a supplement for my health, it changed my life for the better and made me turn back into the smart, loving, outgoing person I once was before having an addiction to prescribed medications. I still continue to use Kratom to support my pain when needed, but I am happy to say I have never been addicted to it. I feel healthy, and more alive like I used to be. I am a true supporter that if it wasn't for Kratom, then I probably would have continued going down a nasty path from being addicted to prescribed pain medicine, and there is no telling what could have happened to me.\n   Kratom has given me my whole life back. I almost lost everything due to my addiction from pain medicine that a doctor prescribed me. Before discovering Kratom, I didn't ever want to leave my home. I felt trapped because the medicine took over, and I relied on it to get through everything. Since discovering and starting Kratom, my life turned one hundred percent around. I am running a business full time with my husband, while also pursuing an education to become a criminal lawyer. The Kratom was a miracle, and the best thing is I am no longer addicted to anything anymore! What a blessing. I truly believe God showed me. Kratom to turn my life around to the right path that was always meant for me. I have always been someone since a child who was completely against any prescribed medicine. I didn't believe in it. I still look back, and I am shocked I even agreed to being prescribed pain medicine. I am saying this because I did lots of research on Kratom before just trying something, even when starting new vitamins I do the same. If you search Kratom, you cannot find anything hardly negative about Kratom. Even the claimed side effects are nothing compared to prescribed medications. I have never had one bad side effect from it. I am not addicted to it like the DEA is claiming it to be. You can search Kratom in Google and just see ALL of the thousands and thousands of people that use Kratom for specific/different needs. It helps thousands of people from addiction, to an alternate source for pain, anxiety, depression, and much more. There is no one who even abuses it like the DEA is claiming it is used for. It cannot even be abused.\n Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I normally would never get involved with such a big controversy, but you could be effecting my life if this is scheduled and not kept legal. I want to tell you my story so you see how Kratom effects me. I fear you, the DEA, will cause issues by making Kratom anything but legal the way it","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12049","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Britt Taylor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Morgan Wokoun and I am 27 year old father of three children and I use kratom daily. I first got introduced to kratom three years ago by my wife the night before I went on terminal leave from the Army. While serving in the Army, I injured my back, both of my knees, and also started dealing with overwhelming anxiety and depression. I remember my first time taking kratom extremely well because that night was the first night, in over a year and a half (at that time), that my anxiety wasn't controlling me and I was pain free. I had made the decision to leave the comfort of having a salary and guaranteed housing in the Army because all the pain I was in, mental and physical. For the first time in a very long time, I didn't know what I was going to do next in my life. Life in the Army was very easy for me because all I had to do was listen to what my leadership said to do, and I would receive a paycheck every two weeks. At that time I had two children and a wife who depended on me to survive. Immediately after getting out of the Army I started my treatment and saw a civilian doctor who just kept me on the same medication I was on while serving, multiple pain meds along with antidepressants and antianxiety medication. The medication wasn't all that effective but at that point I was on pain meds so long that I became dependent on them and knew that I was addicted. I had put all my faith in the healthcare system and my families future depended on me being a functional member of society again, but that system failed me and instead of looking to fix the issues, they covered them up with medications causing addiction. Fast forward a six months later and I moved my family back to our home state of Massachusetts and had no healthcare coverage but still had an opiate addiction. My addiction grew and within two months was using heroin intravenously, and because of it almost lost everything, including my children. To keep my family together I had to get sober and without a doubt I would not have been able to do that without kratom. To me, kratom is much more than a way to battle withdrawals, because of kratom I don't need to take anymore of the medications I was on before. Because of kratom I am no longer crippled by my anxiety and back pain. Because of kratom I am an active member of society. That is why I am reaching out and giving a quick run down of my story, because without kratom I am truly scared of what will happen. Kratom has the potential to benefit millions and millions of people and banning it will only make our countries opiate epidemic worse. With all that being said I would like to thank anyone who reads this for their time and I hope in the end kratom will remain legal and more people can find out how beneficial the plant really is. \n\n-Morgan Wokoun","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7484","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Morgan Wokoun","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

I am an accountant/business owner. I'm also a mom, volunteer, animal welfare advocate and avid runner. I've been taking the supplement Kratom for over three years now and it's changed my life. For decades I've suffered from depression and anxiety and resulting social awkwardness. I realize now that I've been searching, forever it seems, for a healthy alternative in the plant family that would help with my issues as listed above. Nothing seems even close to kratom. I found out about Kratom by watching many many testimonials about the benefits of this wonderful herb. So I decided to try it myself. Since that time my life has forever changed. Over the past three years I've experienced great energy, a positive highly motivated attitude. I've become much more comfortable in social situations. I've experienced such a relief from my past negativity and experience great joy just from living life to the best of my ability. I no longer take any prescription medications for depression which is an added plus.  I would hate to see this wonderful discovery disappear from my life. Please consider my comments as well as others who really enjoy kratom's benefits. In conclusion, I've learned through my own experience that kratom is safe, and self-regulating. You simply cannot take too much without feeling a bit nauseous. This alone deters a person from taking more than they should. I think the benefits of Kratom cannot be ignored based on my testimonial as well as the tremendous public outcry to keep Kratom legal.  There are many people out there who use kratom to relieve chronic pain. They simply do not want to take any prescriptions but rather prefer to take something that grows naturally and has no significant side effects. Please care enough for the people of America and keep Kratom legal and available to the public.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0865","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Barbara Moscato","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me get over long term alcohol abuse.

I'm against the DEA's intent on scheduling the actives in Mitrigyna Speciosa. First off I want to reference a paper published in JACS (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.6b00360) which notes the novel action of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine in its G-protein-biased  partial agonism of the mu-opioid receptor, which do not recruit -arrestin following receptor activation, giving them a binding pose at the mu-opioid receptor that is distinct from that of classical opioids. This novel action is something that the people who take kratom have come to know from experience. Its vastly different from any illegal or pharmaceutical opioid. In my experience and echoed in many others testimony, it is very tame and free of side effects, much akin to coffee or aspirin and should be treated as such. But unlike coffee it can have a dramatic impact on peoples lives who suffer from chronic pain like me. Having gotten off of prescription pain meds due to dependency and side effects over 5 years ago I was struggling with debilitating pain that kept me from working regularly and enjoying life. My primary care physician suggested I go back to pain management. That was the only option she gave me and completely unacceptable. I did my own research and found Kratom. It has change my life for the better and I can say it is unlike any other opioid. It really is on par with coffee. I get a mild reduction in pain, just enough to function, mild stimulation less than coffee, and if I take too much it just makes me nauseous, a self limiting property of it, and if I take it too often, it just loses effectiveness. It truly is just about the most harmless substance there is yet with huge benefits for millions and potentially many more. My friend just got off heroin with it and is working again. My mother takes it occasionally for acute pain. As it is right now it is an easily obtainable remedy for the common person. Scheduling it or over regulating it would be a tragedy at this point with so many depending on it and with only more harmful and deadly alternatives. Thank you for your time.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9702","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"A V","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was addicted to opiates for the past 13 years including heroin.

It may sound like an innocuous ailment, but it is not.  At lease 2-3 times per week (and sometimes for several days in a row), I lay down at night to sleep and feel an itching sensation that I can only describe as ants crawling on my leg bones.  The only way to relieve the itching/crawling feeling is to stretch my legs, pump them in the air, and otherwise move them -- somewhat like rubbing my muscles over my leg bones to \"scratch\" them.  It doesn't matter how tired I am, I have to move my legs in such a manner to relieve the itch.  This goes on for hours -- sometimes lasting until morning.  Other parts of my body such as my rib cage, back and arms, have frequently been affected as well.  The sleep deprivation due to RLS has affected many areas of my life, and my constant movements at night have also caused my husband to lose sleep.\n\nI consulted my family doctor, who prescribed Ropinirole, a common treatment for RLS.  It provided some relief at first, but then actually exacerbated my symptoms so that it progressively became much worse and happened more frequently.  Upon joining the Restless Legs Foundation (www.rls.org) and chatting with other members, I found that the exacerbation of RLS is fairly common with Ropinrirole.  I also supplement my diet with magnesium, potassium, iron, and other minerals which seem to provide some relief.  I am in good health otherwise, and do not imbibe in recreational drugs.  I rarely drink alcohol, as it seems to trigger my symptoms.\n\nOn the suggestion of some members of the Foundation, I tried Kratom.  The first time I used it, I was overcome by the immediate cessation of the itching sensation in my legs.  Unlike traditional opioids, which Kratom has been compared to, the relief wasn't centered in my brain.  With opioids such as hydrocodone, often a patient can still feel pain, but the \"high\" caused by such a drug makes it so that they no longer care about feeling pain.  On the contrary, Kratom does NOT make me feel impaired and, instead, immediately acts on the source of my discomfort -- the itch in my legs disappears entirely.  In the morning, I have absolutely no residual symptoms such as grogginess.\n\nFor the past few years, I have taken about 1 teaspoon Kratom whenever I have symptoms.  On e nights I do not take Kratom, I do not suffer from any withdrawal, nor do I ever crave Kratom. In this amount of time, I have not had to increase my dosage at all in order to consistently provide total relief from RLS symptoms.\n\nPlease do not take away the only supplement that has ever provided relief for my restless legs.  My experience with Kratom has demonstrated that it is no more dangerous than traditional pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.  While my education in Chemistry and Forensic Science (as well as Mechanical Engineering and Law) have enabled me to have somewhat of an understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the main constituents of Kratom, including mitragynine and its derivatives, it is evident that much more research needs to be conducted on them.  As a regulatory agency committed to the health and safety of citizens, you should encourage medical research on Kratom since it clearly has medicinal value for RLS, as a pain reliever, and most likely other uses as well.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21392","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nellie Kaufman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I wholeheartedly disagree with the potential ban against Kratom for the following reasons.

I think it is very obvious that the scheduling of Kratom will lead to more opiate related deaths.  \n\nWhen the announcement was made that there would be an emergency scheduling of Kratom, one of the key arguments was that Kratom has been linked to 15 deaths.  Once I started looking into these deaths I found that there were chemicals added to the kratom itself (bad manufacturing), or it was in combination with other drugs.  In some cases it seems likely the death would have occurred if you completely took Kratom out of the equation.  For example, in one case a lady died with kratom and phenazepam in her system.  Phenazepam is a dangerous drug.  Phenazepam has contributed to 9 recent deaths in Tarrant County, Texas alone.  It seems unfair and bias to blame cases like this on Kratom. \n\nRecently, I saw an interview with a San Francisco cop, speaking out about Kratom.  In the interview he states many Kratom users will go back to using other drugs, like opiates and heroine.  Between 1999-2014 more than 165,000 people have died from prescription opiates in U.S. and 10,574 died in 2014 alone from heroine in the U.S.  It seems like some kratom users will be pushed to using drugs that are actually dangerous.

I wanted to state how kratom has helped me with my life. I first want to state how I have no impulsive desire constantly to take this supplement  as it does not get you \"high.\" It simply causes a slight mood lift. I also do not have any so-called \"withdrawal symptoms\" upon discontinuation as even coffee causes more of a \"withdrawal\" effect than kratom ever has in my experience. Kratom is not a substitute for any type of prescription drug nor medical care. The FDA disclaimer applies to all the comments I am about to make about kratom as it does not cure, diagnose, treat or prevent any form of disease. Kratom supports my health in many ways. It relieves occasional sleeplessness. Helps me focus and stay on task. Reduces anxious feelings and obsessive compulsive behavior. Relieves very minor pain from mild injuries. Helps restore mental alertness when experiencing mild, occasional fatigue. I believe kratom should be classified as an herbal supplement that needs to be unregulated as all other herbal and non-herbal supplements are. Kratom is not at all recreational in my opinion, nor is it a substitute for medical care. I am not self-medicating with this in place of prescription drugs. I'm simply using this to support my health and well-being.

It is not any more dangerous than caffiene. I was addicted to opiates and could not cut down for the life of me. But when I discovered kratom, it helped with the withdrawal symptoms tremendously. Without kratom it would be impossible to wean off. I would get sick and miss work and it would just be unbearable. And kratom has not given me any bad side effects and I do not go into withdrawals if I don't have them. If the purpose is to keep people off drugs, then making kratom illegal is just going to make things worse because people will just go back to taking addictive drugs like painkillers or heroin, etc. It is just a horrible idea! And in reality, ANY substance can be fatal if a person ingests too much of it. People have died from consuming too much WATER! We cannot punish everyone because of a few people who decide to go completely overboard with things. If alcohol is legal, then kratom should definitely be legal too!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is charles Scott i think kratom should remain legal it just is to vaualble to be banned and let noone use this wonderful plant to help themselfs i know from personal experience that this plant helped me rid myself of opiates and i belive it  can for others as well as keep them off of them","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18810","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles Scott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA\n\nI am a law abiding , tax paying citizen of these \"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\" and as such I was under the impression that the government was supposed to look after my best interests, but when the DEA proposed to place kratom as a schedule 1 drug , my confidence in the government's ability to be rational was skewed somewhat. To place kratom in the same classification as heroin , and cocaine is ludicrous and reaching at best. I have been taking kratom for about 2 years now , I have severe pain issues associated with my lower back and degenerative disc disease. I have gone the traditional route with orthopedic doctors and therapy as well as taking narcotic pain medication under the advise of a physician mind you, and none of those measures have produced a positive outcome for me, and we all know that taking prescription pain medication for a lengthy period of time can certainly lead to a physical and mental dependence on those medications. I too was skeptical of kratom at first, and didn't think it would do anything for me , but after a couple of weeks of taking two servings a day , a serving being one cup of tea made from the plant, my pain started to dimish significantly and has been manageable ever since . I don't find myself ever craving kratom , but it definitely has worked for me. I am in the medical field and I see what drug addiction looks like on a daily basis at the hospital, and I don't know of anyone who has come into the hospital with a kratom related issues ever. In my opinion , this is nothing more than BIG PHARMA trying to corner the market on a natural remedy because it is taking away from their profit share bottom line. I sincerely hope that the DEA will look into all the comments and all the the research that has been done as well as additional research in the future. I truly believe that if more people with pain issues would give kratom a chance there would be far less opiate related overdose in this country, and if kratom were to be placed in schedule 1 category, there will be far more opiate related overdoses I'm sure.

I developed it in June from too heavy of weight lifting and not listening to my body. It's a nightmare to deal with. Constant dull pain I feel every time I breathe, brutal, debilitating pain waves that bring me to my knees. The only pain control I knew was Ibuprofen and Aleve. I built a tolerance so quickly that taking 3 would only give me 1-2 hours of pain relief. I knew it was damaging my liver and body but I didn't care, anything to stop the pain. I didn't want to step up to anything more addicting either so it seemed to be my only choice. \n\nI reached out to friends who had gone through similar experiences and one suggested I try kratom. The results have been astounding. I do 4g in the morning and get 7-9 hours of almost 100% pain relief. Then I do 4g in the evening when the pain starts to kick back up again and it carries me through the night. I went from taking 20+ Ibuprofen/Aleve a day to zero. I'm still in shock how well it works for just being a plant. I like the fact there really isn't a tolerance with it either, I stick with the 4g and get the same pain relief every time. I don't really feel a \"high\" with it, it's more akin to a coffee buzz. It doesn't impair me physically or mentally in any way, at least the amount I've experienced it at, I haven't gone any further than the 4g. And I know for sure my liver is thanking me.\n\nI can work at the computer and not have to take a \"pain break\" every couple hours and lie in bed with an ice pack. I can drive my car around and not worry about how the twisting of the wheel is going to mess with the pain. I can head out and not have to be concerned if I brought enough Ibuprofen to last me through the day. \n\nI might still be unable to lift weights but at least I don't have to deal with the vicious pain. I never really understood the struggle that people with chronic pain go through until I developed costochondritis. Luckily my pain is only temporary, I couldn't imagine having to deal with this every day for the rest of my life. I just wanted to offer the viewpoint of an athlete working through an injury. For pain relief it is simply the best of the best! \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7503","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tony M","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not escalate the failed War on Drugs.

The amount of time off they take because of hurting has been reduced to about a quarter of what it was before.  I think they both drink it daily like coffee.  I tasted it once and it was horrible, but if it keeps my guy able to think and be safe on the jobsite and reduces his pain from previous injuries so that he can work then it's a good thing to me.  When he was on painkillers he seemed out of it, and you have to be aware when working on a jobsite so that was a bad thing.  Kratom seems to keep him thinking and able to work and provide for his family.  The longtime user works in the office and I have yet to see any disadvantage of her taking Kratom, and even though she goes a week or two without it sometimes I haven't seen any withdrawal symptoms at all...it is much worse when she is dieting and avoiding sugar!

It has been a very valuable tool to help with the process of overcoming my mental struggles, and I can happily say that my conditions have improved significantly over the course of time that I've been utilizing Kratom. Despite it being a very effective plant, I haven't had any cravings for it or withdrawal effects when I go off of it for months at a time. By comparison, its effects are in the range of coffee in terms of intensity, in my experience. That meaning, mild-moderate effects that become counterproductive and unenjoyable at any high dose, mostly due to nausea. By that I'm saying that it's not a plant that opens itself to abuse/dependence unless the person simply abuses anything they get their hands on.\n\nGiven how much this has helped people, and that it has done significant harm to essentially no one, banning this plant would be foolish, and would do nothing more for the DEA than to further promote the disrespect of the people for irrational and unscientifically knee-jerk policymaking. Huge numbers of former heavy pain pill and heroine addicts would be forced to go back to their old habits to manage chronic pain and other symptoms if this plant were to be banned, inevitably resulting in thousands of more deaths to add to the tens of thousands in this country that already die every year from heavy opioids and opiates. This plant needs to be accepted as the therapeutic tool that it is. It needs to be researched to determine the different effects of various strain compositions, as well as to determine a set of best practices for effective and safe use.\n\nTo be frank, the policies of the DEA have already done more harm than good to the fabric of society in this country. If you want to turn the tide and prevent the obsoletion of your agency, you have to start making policy based upon actual evidence, mechanistically based risk, and scientific method, not some fear-based authoritarian control freak tactics that are the hallmark behaviors of ignorant and insecure people. Otherwise, intelligent and informed people like myself lose all respect for your authority because it's akin to being conceitedly told how to eat healthy by an obese person who eats Big Macs every day and has never read a single book or science journal about nutrition.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13951","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick Hughes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"to all concerned,\n I discovered kratom about one year ago.

I'm sure you've heard the following. I hope you will take it to heart. \n\n- Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n- If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n- Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\n- Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n- Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n- Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nSirs/Madams, we have placed bans on substances that never had any business being banned in the first place, causing us, as a country, to be behind more forward thinking countries. Hemp is one such substance. I'm glad to see the U.S. opening up to all the potential uses for hemp, as they are myriad. I honestly don't know a whole lot about kratom, but I do believe that we need to think of ALL the possibilities before we take any actions such as banning a chemical that is useful.\n\nThank you for paying attention to what we, the consumers, have to say.\n\nSincerely,\nDebbie Schlinger\nP.O.

Please do not restrict Kratom to  schedule 1 controlled substances for which it is slated to be.\nI had a bad hip at thirty five years of age and received a now known defunct hip from Depuy. It caused an amazing amount of metalosis which created arthritis, and enormous pain.  Tried for years to believe what doctors were saying that it was all in my head but my ability to think clearly had also been compromised.  I lived for years in pain with depleted motor skills and increasing immobility. My Drs advised a revision hip. It took some of the pain away from the first surgery yet referred pain had set in from trying to cope for so many years with an injury that went unaddressed. See they refused to believe I was in pain until Depuy recalled their hips for leeching metal into people's bodies, also as a result of trying to cope I injured, my knees, ankle and back along with the other hip. My Drs gave me norco, which worked for a while. When it felt as though the pain was only being masked with norco as well as aspirin could mask it my Drs suggested oxycodine. I said no, I can live with a certain amount of pain I will just take aspirin. My life became endless days in pain in bed, when I thought enough time had passed my resistency to norco will have subsided I thought about trying that again and found it difficult to function in society as it makes me sleepy, a friend recommended Kratom and my life changed, I am able to get out of bed and function in society on a level I have not seen in years. I was so amazed with its effectivity and the fact that it had ZERO side effects. Unlike tramadol which made me hallucinate, feel as if I had pneumonia, gave me a depressed anxiety, I told a Dr I had this effect with tramadol so they prescribed me nucynta, which is basically tramadol in a new bottle, I became so afraid of Drs and their inability to do what is correct for a patient I sunk into an enormous depression, I lived for two weeks  trying to detox my body and mind from what my Drs assured me was safe when I remembered the Kratom was in my drawer, this is not an exaggeration, less than one half an hour later my anxiety, depression, fear and pain had subsided after taking Kratom, I am afraid to say what may have happened had Kratom not been there.   My pain is extreme and seems to get worse as I try to push thru it, but with Kratom I am at ease and a lot of the pain levels off allowing me functional fully for parts of my day. Please do not consider this a drug and also I agree it needs to be monitored because I understand unscrupulous people have taken advantage and manipulated it into something it is not intended to be.  But so many of us will live in darkness, live in pain, turn to heroin because we have lost faith in the fact that pharmaceutical companies have taken over the medical profession. Believe me when I tell you that should you go ahead and place Kratom on schedule 1 a frenzy of heroin addictions and overdoses will ensue along with suicides by people like me who refuse to be a part of the human experiment big pharma is performing and refuse to be pushed into the heroin conformity also taking place. We can no longer pretend what is happening is in our best interest. It happens for profit sake, period. We are aware and will continue to educate and rewrite laws to suit a kinder society... I no longer believe you operate in our best interest. Or with science and facts to back up your actions... we have science and facts and numbers of voting citizens who are hoping and praying you do what is right for the citizens.

I am a law abiding, tax paying, professional citizen, father of three with no criminal record. I am not a deviant in any sense of the word. \nThere is a lot of literature out there framing kratom as a treatment for opiate addicts and a possible treatment for addicts of many other drugs including alcohol. I have no drug or alcohol abuse issues but I can testify that when I use kratom it certainly reduces any desire I have to drink and so I can imagine that property would carry to other drugs as well. There is also a lot of literature regarding its analgesic properties to which I can also testify. \nThat being said, neither of these are the reason I use kratom. I use kratom in the same way that I use coffee and kratom may be called a drug only with the fairness that allows coffee to also be called a drug. I do not drink coffee to achieve intoxication and I do not drink kratom tea to achieve intoxication. In the same way as you can drink too much coffee and feel uncomfortable, so it is with kratom. It is self-regulating. \nCoffee is used not to intoxicate but to augment ones consciousness, as is kratom. Both of these plants contribute to ones sense of well-being and neither one is more dangerous than the other. That is to say that neither one is dangerous to any degree which would give an informed reasonable person concern. It boggles the mind that the federal government is considering placing this unadulterated plant on a schedule which criminalizes it alongside heroin. This proposition is either being explored as a result of extreme incompetence and willful ignorance or as a result of special interest influence in the effort to eliminate a plant that could serve as natural, safe, and inexpensive competing product to existing or planned pharmacological products for pain relief, antianxiety, and or depression. I much suspect the latter. \nProhibition and criminalization in regards to any drug has never been a successful solution and has always caused and continues to cause more problems than it solves. Weve made many mistakes in our drug laws in the past and the legacy of these mistakes has been new and dangerous forms of these drugs in ever concentrated and impure forms, a thriving black market to distribute them, and mass incarceration and destruction of lives that would otherwise not have been destroyed. Had the DEA criminalized the coffee bean in the past, they would have created an indestructible monster with all of those properties of dangerous concentrated impure forms, the thriving black market, and a class of incarcerated souls and destroyed lives. \nKratom is a ground up unadulterated leaf as it exists right now. It helps millions across the world and harms a statistically insignificant few. If they choose, the DEA can create an indestructible monster out of this leaf, as they have done with the poppy and the coca leaf, or they can in the 21st century make a different decision informed by those past mistakes and let harmless leaves be harmless leaves. I do not break the law and I do not wish the law to break me.\nThank you for considering my opinion on this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14729","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Cole","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We, as the citizens of the United States of America, have rights which are meant to be secured by the government of which derives its just powers from the consent of the governed.

I am 40 years old and work at a marina doing various manual labor and electrical jobs on boats, mainly sailboats.  I am writing to state my opposition to the proposal of placing kratom on the list of Schedule I controlled substances.  Doing so can only have negative results- not only for me but for thousands of others who rely on kratom for various different issues.\n\nI began using kratom about 2 years ago. Before that, I was taking a prescribed narcotic pain reliever but was experiencing side effects common to those types of medications- drowsiness, upset stomach, anxiety, and withdrawal symptoms are just a few examples of what I lived with daily while taking Norcos.  Needless to say, these side effects not only had detrimental impacts on my own life, but on my work and relationships as well. I needed a different way to control my chronic back pain.\n\nI began looking for more natural pain remedies and came across information on kratom.  I decided to do some research and give it a try.  Kratom has made a HUGE difference in my life for the better. It eases my pain without any negative side effects.  There are absolutely no withdrawal symptoms- it doesn't matter if I miss one dose or five. While it has not cured me, taking it as a supplement has significantly reduced my pain levels while allowing me to stay alert and less anxious.  I am able to do my job efficiently and have more energy to spend time with my family.  In the two years that I have been taking kratom daily, I have never experienced any hallucinations or feelings of intoxication from it nor had any feelings of addiction that are so common with Norcos and medications similar to that.  These are just a few of the benefits of kratom.  According to a recent Forbes article, Kratom research could, in fact, lead to new, less dangerous painkillersbut it will happen a lot faster if the plant isnt banned. The rest of the article can be read here.\n\nKratom has quite simply saved my life.  Before kratom, I was taking prescribed opiate pain relief, was unemployed and depressed.  Kratom has helped relieve my pain which made finding a job easier.  I am able to do any job asked of me at work and know that I don't have to stick to a strict medication schedule, worry about withdrawals/side effects and can work with less pain.  If I hadn't found kratom, I could very well still be unemployed, draining my state by collecting disability and/or assistance payments when I am young and healthy enough to work and support myself and my family.  My mood is better,  my energy higher and my pain lessened.  Classifying kratom with highly addictive opiates without fully understanding it's positive properties is not only unfair, it is irresponsible.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20510","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Hildreth","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am in opposition to the scheduling of any  plants in their natural whole form and am especially against the banning of Kratom.\n\nI am a 37 year old  marketing executive from southeast Michigan. I have been successfully using Kratom for four years.\n\nIn the past I suffered from pain both physical and emotional resulting in periodic bouts of depression. Because I am a high performing, high functioning adult I do not have the luxury of wallowing in bed for days when depression comes on. (taking to to my bed was becoming a too frequent habit.)\n\nI first obtained Vicodin via prescriptions after surgeries. They worked so well that I began using Vicodin periodically  due to physical pain that was psychosomatic, e.g. so distraught emotionally that my back would lock up and be inflamed and physically painful to the touch. I obtained these Vicodin both legally via doctor prescription and illegally from friends and family members. I prided myself on the fact that I never bought or stole Vicodin but I was aware enough to recognize that at any moment I could have slipped from a casual self prescribing user (about 1-3 a month  on average) to an addict.\n\nIncreased reports regarding the danger of Vicodin led me to pursue alternatives, that is how I discovered Kratom. Kratom has been a wonderful addition to my life. I am no longer dependent on Vicodin and now rarely use Kratom. The Vicodin dependency was probably mostly psychological for me. I was always anxious that  I would run out or not be able to get Vics if I had an episode and needed them. Kratom is readily available so there in none of this anxiety. I've experienced several years in a row of good mental health, (for the first time in my adult life) and so don't have much need for any opiods or opioid like products. I will say that without access to Kratom and Vicodin I most likely would not have entered these years of stability.\n\nI am a trained herbalist and plants are magic. As you know most of our pharmaceuticals are derived or synthesized from active ingredients from plants. These plants have been placed here by God and it is our divine right to access them unencumbered. I do not want to have to  go to a doctor and get a prescription for Kratom, nor do I want it banned so I am forced to use pharmaceuticals It is unnecessary and unfair and a boon to only the corporate class and big pharma.\n\nLastly, I was under the impression that we are the most free country in the world. I demand to keep my right to care for my health needs as I see fit and not be treated as a cash cow and forced to take artificial medication that is bad for me instead of my preferred plant medicine. I am comfortable 'being the captain of my soul' and having the final say of what is and isn't harmful for me and my family. If you are truly concerned for the public safety you the FDA and NHI can team up and conduct studies regarding efficacy, active alkaloids, dosage, interactions etc. and dispense the information so we the public can be accurately informed of plants and their properties, benefits, and dangers. Let me be clear publicly funded studies not ones backed by corporate interests (bigpharma) which are easily and usually manipulated. You can also move to ban synthetic version of Kratom, Marijuana and other plants such as bath salts, and unschedule ALL natural plants.   If you are truly concerned about safety don't worry there are consumer protection laws that can apply to mislabeling and the like. Also you could scoot Kratom to dietary supplement status then the corresponding laws would apply. Under NO circumstance is the best option to shcedule Kratom.\n\nBe on the right side of history the JIG is up no one  with  more than 3 brain cells to rub together trusts you the FDA or bigpharma. Course correct and become an actual benefit to the public you supposedly serve. Let I also remind you that you and all government officials serve at the pleasure of the people and you are to take your direction from us!

Kratom has been used safely for years by thousands of people - please do not remove our ability to turn to nature to remedy everyday problems. \n\nIt seems as if the move to schedule kratom serves the criminal justice system by justifying its existence, especially as marijuana becomes legal, and the pharmaceutical industry, by removing a natural and inexpensive alternative. In a free and just society, this is unacceptable. Americans should have access to safe herbal treatments. There is no crisis or imminent danger; not a single death can be attributed solely to kratom. Compare this to prescription drugs and even common household items, common causes of illness and death.\n\nThere is no justifiable reason to make kratom illegal and unavailable.

I am currently a kratom user and oppose placement of kratom on the Schedule 1 list or any legislation that would prevent kratom being sold as a dietary supplement.\n\nI first used kratom in 2014 when looking at different supplements for back pain stemming from a lingering injury. I found information on kratom and the additional effects of relieving anxiety and having a calming effect also sounded appealing. I conducted research on online vendors to find the most reputable ones. I also researched responsible use of kratom as a dietary supplement and made my first purchase in the Spring of 2014.\n\nMy research paid off as I consider the dietary supplement quality to be very good as well as the instructions on how to take kratom. My goal was simply to see the effect on back pain and my mood that kratom would have.\n\nI work in mental healthcare which can be mentally draining and results in social burnout. I interact with patients with persistent mental illness on a daily basis for my job. Kratom not only helped my quality of life and job performance by reducing back pain as my injury healed but it also improved my general mood as well, resulting in better time away from work to rejuvenate myself mentally. Kratom is valuable to those struggling with social anxiety.\n\nI have used kratom off and on in the last couple years, finding no adverse side effects from use or quitting use of kratom. I have gone from once a day use to quitting completely with no issues.\n\nPlease consider this testimonial during your evaluation of kratom as a valuable dietary supplement. It is not merely a recreational substance but a dietary supplement that improves the quality of life for the average citizen.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20764","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Milo Bennett","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Greg. I am 47 years old and have struggled with alcohol dependence and generalized anxiety disorder for the past 30 years. I have spent much of the last 20 years either in jail for alcohol related offenses or in rehab facilities. At one point I was homeless and addicted to alcohol and many illegal drugs. In 2007 I entered a rehab facility and came out drug free but have never been able to stop abusing alcohol completely. In the past decade I have been able to achieve 30 days of sobriety at best despite innumerable attempts. I always found my way back to alcohol to cope with my personal struggles including extreme anxiety.\n \nI started using Kratom 1.5 years ago. I first tried Kratom in small doses hoping to help curb my alcohol cravings while at work and it helped to a degree. Then six months ago I entered a 7-day detox facility and when I came out I researched more about Kratom to learn more effective ways of using it and developed more appropriate dosages. I started to supplement daily with Kratom and am proud to say that I have now been alcohol free for six months, the longest period of sobriety I have ever been able to attain. Kratom has been invaluable to my success and it scares me to think about where I would be if it were to be banned or scheduled .\n \nNot only does Kratom help me remain sober it also helps alleviate pain associated with past injuries allowing me to work on my feet for extended periods of time and remain productive. I know many other people who find significant pain relief through Kratom instead of using prescription medications which have proven to have so many dangerous side effects. Being prescribed such medications has turned them and every other person using them into a potential opiate addict. Kratom helps so many people I know to avoid active opiate addiction and escape becoming a tragic statistic in the opiate overdose epidemic that this country is currently battling.\n \nKratoms potential for abuse is not as perilous as some would like us believe. For me (and many others I know) Kratom has a ceiling effect since large amounts will cause nausea well before any enhanced euphoric effects. Sure there will be people who consume Kratom in a less than responsible way much like many overdo things they find good in their life such as food, coffee, soda, etc. but I believe that responsible use can be achieved via educating people better without using the types of propaganda and fear tactics that have been repeatedly presented by the government.\n \nThe known adverse side effects of Kratom seem pretty benign. Withdrawal is possible with abrupt Kratom cessation, but the symptoms are pretty slight, with headache, runny nose, and restless leg syndrome being the worst. That is quite harmless compared to withdrawal from opiates or alcohol and are not a good reason to schedule Kratom and take it away from so many people who find it helpful to them for so many reasons allowing them an increased quality of life. The benefits of keeping this plant accessible greatly outweigh any alleged negative aspects. \n\nPeople have reaped benefits from Kratom for thousands of years and in that time it has shown nearly no potential to cause death. 15 deaths are being attributed to Kratom worldwide in the history of its known use. In all but one of those there were other more dangerous prescription and/or illegal drugs involved and those 15 deaths pale in comparison to the number of deaths every day involving alcohol and tobacco which are legally used both responsibly and irresponsibly by adults in great numbers. Increased calls to poison control concerning Kratom over the last few years are more likely due to its increased popularity as more people learn about it and how it has helped so many people. I can't recall one case that involved anything more serious than the complaint of nausea and headache.\n\nSo I strongly urge you to not schedule Kratom in any of the 5 categories. Doing so will make it harder or impossible to obtain for so many people who can and do receive tremendous benefits from this plant. Perhaps some regulation is needed but scheduling this plant could potentially result in increased alcohol and opiate abuse, if not many unnecessary deaths from overdose of prescription/illegal opiates.\n\nThere is also information about some requests through the FOIA that are not being fulfilled regarding the footnote information in the original intent to schedule. This information is supposed to be accessible to anyone who requests it, and yet it has not been released to at least one individual upon request. There seems to be no transparency when it comes to this information. To be fair I hope that all requested information be released to anyone that has gone through the proper channels to obtain it.\n\nSincerely,\nGreg Jackson \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Greg Jackson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I found kratom 3 years ago when a friend who suffers from fibromyalgia recommended it as an alternative to opiates. I've suffered from fibromyalgia, neck arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome for 12 years. I've been on various prescribed drugs over the years,  including addictive opiates that have inherent dangers. Kratom research shows that kratom does not have the same dangers as opiates,  in fact, Scientific American calls kratom the perfect painkiller because it lacks the dangerous respiratory suppression that can lead to death. Kratom is 55 times less potent than morphine, yet it lowers my pain levels considerably. I never have had to increase my dose to achieve the same effects. Personally,  I have never experienced any withdrawal symptoms when I have run out of kratom, nor has my roommate who I helped in her withdrawal from alcohol and prescription drugs. I have helped people online successfully in their withdrawal from heroin addiction and saw them be able to become active members of society. Without kratom,  they were on the road to death. Please allow ample time for kratom to be further studied by the medical community. For more information on the study I made reference to in my statements, go to https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kratom-drug-ban-may-cripple-promising-painkiller-research/ Please keep Kratom legal for chronic pain patients and drug addicts who wish to be free of opiate addiction. The science mirrors my personal experience. I appreciate your willingness to learn how kratom has helped me and my friends. Before kratom, I was bedridden.

I've suffer with severe bipolar disorder and Chronic Pain in my back and knees. I began having issues as a teenager. I have been prescribed Paxil, Zoloft, anatriptaline, Valium, Depakote, and a few others. Nothing helped me. I had a motorcycle accident that severed my foot from my leg. I was prescribed perscription opiates. They helped for a very short time. A few months into using the prescribed opiates and they stopped working. So I was prescribed stronger higher doses, and that was the pattern for awhile. I tried stopping the opiates, which was the worst thing I've ever been through. The pain I was going through and the mental agony I experienced was tremendous. So now on top of my bipolar, I was dependent on opiates. I would feel good one month and another month or so I would go into a deep dark depression. I was either way up or way down. Which to me at the time was better than being severely depressed all the time. Either way, I was unable to take care of myself or my family with any kind of consistency. This pattern went on into my 30s. At the age of 32 I was introduced through differing support groups to plants and herbs that others claimed had helped them with similar issues. I tried quite a few and did quite a bit of research. Many did help. Then I began using Kratom. I found a combination of green vein, and red vein leaves that began to help me considerably. Once I found the strain and proper amount to take, I noticed and family members noticed an enormous improvement in my wellbeing in general. I've been taking Kratom Four years now. I feel stable and balanced and just plain capable. Im well into a career now as a CNC department supervisor. I've been working the same place for two years. Prior to this job I haven't been stable enough to maintain employment for any longer than 6 to 9 months. My family wife and children all attest to the difference this plant has made in my life. They feel as though they can depend on me, and they can and do now. I feel as though I'm clear minded, goal oriented, motivated, happy more times than not because of my using kratom. My level of chronic pain and fatigue has all but disappeared. Many other aspects of my life have improved as well I could go on.   That plant changed my whole families welfare not just mine. I beg you to keep this plant available to the public. Age restriction I agree with. Schedule of any kind I strongly disagree with. Hundreds of thousands of people benefit from this plant. I've seen testimonies from mothers that use this plant  and can now manage their families when before they found kratom they could not, fathers that have put down heroin or prescription pain killers and now lead productive lives, Teachers that suffer from fibromyalgia return to work, elderly whom suffer from severe arthritis become active and lead healthy lifestyles because of the benefits this plant has provided for them. Research must be allowed to continue. This plant must not be taken from the people. Our country is experiencing an opiate and pharmaceutical epidemic. This plant has brought many out of the grasp of that epidemic and shows great promise to do so for more. The pharmaceutical companies already have the alkaloids in the kratom plant researched and patented. They want to synthesis it, make it into something they can sell to the public. Everything they touch turns bad. Let the people choose to take this plant in its natural form. The pharmaceutical industry will make something bad out of it, and raise the price on it so much that it will cause hardships. This plant helps people in its natural form. I know my family and I's lives will be turned upside down and many others will also if this plant becomes inaccessible. Addicts will return to street drugs or pain pills, people will have to quit their jobs, vendors will lose their businesses, vital research that's going on right now concerning this plant will be halted, overdoses from heroin, and prescription drugs will spike tragically at very high rates, children will lose their mothers and fathers. There are dire consequences to taking this plant away. Please do not take away a plant that has the potential to thwart the opioid epidemic. \n\nI","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9489","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Davis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nI have been using Kratom for the last 3 years to manage my IBS/Crohn's Disease.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it!

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression.

Kratom has given me a quality of life back that addiction and phychiatric meds took away. I no longer take any medication and I have been able to remain clean and sober from all drugs and alcohol and this is all due to the benefits of kratom. I have not once ever felt impaired or high from kratom. Its nothing like a schedule 1 drug and shouldnt be banned. Ive never craved it when I dont have any and have never experienced withdrawls. There are so many medical benefits we can all gain from this tree that is in the coffee family. If it is banned, addiction, overdose, death, torn ripped apart families and a surge in the opiate epidemic will surely happen. I sincerely ask of you to please not take this away from myself and the many that use it. Thank you very much for allowing the public a chance to comment on something we are so passionate about.

I have had these conditions for 10 years, so I  have tried everything to help my conditions. This is my story.\n\nI was prescribed Methadone, Oxycodone, Tramadol, Ambien,  Lexapro, Valium, Gabapentin, Simvastatin and Tramadol to be taken daily. This was just my most recent cocktail of toxic medications. I have been on every antidepressant and medications in the last 10 years.  I would sleep 14 hours a day most days, unable to do anything. I would fall asleep at the wheel driving 140 miles round trip to my pain management clinic. I had numerous car accidents because of the medication. I came down with a severe case of Palmar Plantar Pustulosis (PPP).  PPP is a form of Psorisis where you have pus filled blisters on your hands and feet. I had it on my feet so bad, that the blisters burst opened, oozed, cracked and bled. The blisters were even under my toenails. I could barley walk and when I could, I cried in pain.  I had this condition for 2 full years and had a add a Dermatologist to my monthly visit in the 140 mile trip.  Between my therapist, pain management doctor, dermatologist and all the medications listed earlier, plus the creams and pills for my feet, I was spending close to $300.00-$400.00 a month.\n\nDue to my health problems, I was fired in 2013 and had to file for disability.  In April 2015, I no longer had any insurance and could not afford new insurance. My pain management doctor basically wouldn't taper my medications unless I could pay the full office visit, which I could not. When I called my pain management Dr.'s office as I was worried going off all those toxic medications cold turkey would be dangerous, the office simply told me I would not die. My only option was to stop all the medications . \n\nGoing off all the opiate medications was unbearable. It was pure agony and I was seriously considering taking my life. I didn't sleep except for 2-3 hours a day for 3 full months.  The only thing at the time that was wonderful, was that after 2 weeks of stopping all medications, my feet completely cleared up and to this day PPP has not returned. My spouse and primary doctor were astonished and that led us to believe that  my PPP was due to all the toxic medications I had been on over the last years. My Fibromyalgia and other conditions returned full force.\n\nI found out about Kratom, a natural supplement in June 2015 on a Chronic Pain board after I told my story.  She private messaged me and gave me the information and I researched it and decided to give it a try.  If it hadn't been a natural plant, I would not have taken it. My spouse and myself were amazed at how well it worked  for me.  It gave me a clearer mind, eased my anxiety, pain and fatigue away for several precious hours and I started living again. I wasn't sleeping all the time, I wasn't so whacked out on pharmaceutical medications. The most I felt was the effects of a good cup of coffee. It eased my muscle pain so I could sleep at night without feeling as if I was sleeping on a bed of rocks and tossing and turning all night. It was also inexpensive and I could afford it. I have used the same amount as I had a year ago.  I could walk my dog without almost collapsing, I could spend time with family and friends again after not leaving the house for almost 3 years. It literally gave me my life back, as it has for so many others.\n\nPlease do not take away my quality of life by making Kratom any other thing except for what it is, a natural plant and supplement.  I do support keeping it for age 18 or 21 and older, however, I can't see any one wanting to use it for recreational purposes as it doesn't give the user any type of reward or high.  I also support taking it out of head shops, gas stations or any other retailer that promotes it as recreational.  I fully support keeping it online and through legitimate herbal and supplement businesses that follow guidelines. My greatest fear is that I will no longer have access to a supplement that gives me back my quality of life, lets me be with family or have the price marked up so much that I will no longer be able to afford it as both my spouse and myself are on Social Security and have limited funds.  \n\nThe economic fallout will also be great if Kratom is drastically changed from a supplement to banned substance. From the farmers in less fortunate countries to the mom and pop businesses that have put their life savings in chasing their dream and opening herbal store fronts or online businesses. We are also in an opioid epidemic that we are drastically losing, we cannot afford to have a plant related to the coffee plant placed in the same category as hard drugs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJudy Steffen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10577","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Judy Steffen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am of the opinion that kratom should stay federally legal. It is unfortunate that kratom has been grouped together with substances like synthetic marijuana and bath salts. Kratom is nothing like either of those. I personally used kratom to come off of Suboxone and I was amazed at how well it worked. The medications (Suboxone and methadone) that are currently available to help addicts just make the person addicted to those substances. Just trading one for the other. Kratom is natural and does not have those same addictive properties which make the choice obvious. I understand if some states want to ban it, that is just the way things are sometimes, but I really hope that people can see kratom for what it really is and not just the hype around it.

I am a professional 48 year old mother and grandmother who has no arrest record and no previous issues with any type of addiction. I have never been in treatment, never missed a day's work, never failed a drug test. I am a person who takes the law seriously and believes that it is important to be a mindful citizen. I am also an occasional Kratom user.\n\nIn my case I have two autoimmune conditions: Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and Pernicious Anemia.  Additionally, I have markers for Fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis.  These conditions are the result of an overabundance of inflammation in the body. Where possible, I manage them by taking care of the body appropriately. However, there are times with the inflammation flares up and the end result is deep joint and muscle pain, extreme lethargy, and an insufferable brain fatigue.  When these conditions flare up, I am sidelined. My quality of life is greatly impacted, my personal productivity comes to a grinding halt, and I am not myself.\n\nI can go to my doctor to have prescriptions written for NSAIDs or for narcotic pain relievers to manage these flare ups; however, my personal research shows me that NSAIDs potentially damage the liver and narcotic pain relief carries a high risk of dependence. Neither of these is therefore a suitable option for me.\n\nEnter Kratom. In researching potential legal, safe, effective alternatives, I learned of this plant.  It has been a godsend. I use it as needed, never use more than needed to manage my pain and energy levels, and discontinue use when I am not in an active flare up. As such, my risk of physical/psychological addiction is extremely low and my ability to manage my autoimmune symptoms remains effective. Moving Kratom to schedule I would leave me in a lurch. I would effectively have no known way to effectively manage my conditions without resorting to methods I've already discarded.\n\nIn addition to my situation, there are hundreds perhaps thousands of people just like me, who have found relief through what has always been a safe and legal natural substance.\n\nI would like the DEA to consider six unintended consequences for placing this product on Schedule I.\n\n1).  There will be a black market created where one did not exist previously, complete with all the negative side effects of any black market.  Best case scenario, people who legally rely on the import and sale of Kratom will have their incomes impacted greatly and tax revenues from the legal sale of this product will disappear.\n\n2).  Potentially thousands of otherwise law abiding citizens will suddenly be converted into criminals and will suffer the consequences of their criminal behavior.  Loss of income, loss of jobs, housing issues, loss of respect in their communities, family disruptions and other natural consequences of criminal activity will result.\n\n3).  Law enforcement and correctional communities, already stretched, will have to accommodate a swell in dockets, swell in jail populations, and swell in overhead and processing costs in managing this new class of criminal.  Our infrastructure is already bursting at the seams and we are already the most incarcerated nation in the world.\n\n4).  Resources used for far more deadly drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and meth will be diverted to find and prosecute Kratom crime.\n\n5).  Since Kratom is used as an abatement and alternative to more harmful drugs such as heroin, more people will be driven back to heroin to manage their true addiction. States like Alabama, who have banned Kratom are already recognizing that impact.\n\n6).  Lastly, the DEA and FDA have already suffered much in the court of public opinion for government overreach. While this citizen recognizes these agencies have the unenviable task of securing public safety, it is difficult to understand the DEA's position here. \n\nAcetominophen overdoses that result in deaths claim 150 American lives yearly, and yet, Tylenol is an OTC medication found in almost all households. The DEAs claim of 15 deaths (14 of which in conjunction with other drugs) over a 5 year span is accordingly hard to fathom.\n\nAs a result of the above, I respectfully ask the DEA to reconsider not placing Kratom on Schedule I.  With heroin running rampant in our communities it is clear where the real demon lies and we need to fight it on many fronts. Removing a substance related to the coffee tree that has been used for hundreds of years effectively and safely throughout the world is not the answer. I am living proof that it can be used responsibly and for a legitimate purpose without any negative implications.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0889","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cheryl Allen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In reference to Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nMy name is Levi Beers and I am strongly against the placement of the herb Kratom into any schedule of the United States Controlled Substances Act. I'm a responsible 34-year-old father of 3 children (ages 4, 3 and 2), loving husband to a Registered Nurse and the owner of my own web development company in Pennsylvania.\n\nI suffer from Degenerative Disc Disease and Spinal Stenosis. In 2014, genetic testing confirmed the \"HLAB27\" antigen, a marker for Ankylosing Spondylitis. This agonizing condition causes my spine and hip bones to inflame to the point of paralysis for a period of hours to days. My treatments have included opiates, steroids and invasive surgeries.\nOpiate therapy was a disaster to my life. For years doctors prescribed morphine IR after surgery and 10mg hydrocodone tablets for daily pain management. These caused me to spend a majority of my time so impaired that I could not work or do anything of social value.\n\nMy first born son died in 2009 from a Congenital Heart Defect. Unable to handle the emotional pain associated with his death, I began drinking to avoid facing reality. This developed into a 5-year addiction to alcohol. I lost many relationships and at my worst, I was unemployed, receiving welfare assistance and completely homeless. Even after an arrest and conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, I still could not stop drinking. After my 2nd probation revocation I was sentenced to 120 days in jail.\n\nBefore beginning my sentence in 2014, I discovered Kratom. Taking Kratom as a supplement to other natural vitamins & minerals along with a healthy diet enabled me to engage in physical exercise and greatly improved my quality of life. I found that the symptoms of my alcohol withdrawal became easier to manage. In 2015, thanks in part to Kratom, I was finally able to break completely free from the nightmare of my 5-year hard alcohol addiction. I am currently 1 year sober without relapse.\nOne of the many benefits of Kratom for me is that unlike opiate or steroid therapy, I do not have to take it every day regardless of my condition. Frequently there are days where my initial morning natural supplement regimen (which includes devil's claw, Kratom, turmeric and a number of minerals) is so effective that I do not take any additional supplements for the rest of the day. When I do not take Kratom on a strict schedule, I am not bothered by distressing withdrawal symptoms like the ones I experienced when doing the same thing with hydrocodone or morphine. With those prescription medications, skipping even one dose would cause severe flu-like symptoms. While I do disagree with the placement of Kratom into any schedule, I agree with actions like those taken by the Health Department in Denver, CO requiring businesses selling Kratom to comply with strict regulatory guidelines.\n\nThese regulatory measures require: \"A consumer advisory is on all applicable menus for Kratom products served for on-site consumption in Denver stores; A consumer advisory is affixed to all Kratom products intended for offsite consumption that are sold in Denver stores; Labeling is affixed to products intended for offsite consumption to identify the product (e.g. ground Kratom leaf) as well as the packager/ manufacturer; Kratom products must be handled in a manner to prevent contamination from poor personal hygiene, unclean equipment, toxic chemicals such as cleaners, and other sources of contamination (www.denver.gov)\" Perhaps an additional public advisory could include directing people to visit fda.gov/alerts/kratom for additional information.\n\nKratom has significantly benefited my life and the lives of my wife and children by allowing me to optimize my physical health with the help of a natural compound. By supplementing with Kratom, I do not have to take dangerous and addictive prescription medications like hydrocodone and morphine. Since I have begun using Kratom, my dose has actually gone down over the last year. Currently, with specific strains and direct suppliers from Indonesia, I am able to take as little as 1 dose every 48 hours and no more than 3 doses in 24 hours in conjunction with other natural supplements and minerals.\nKratom is not a cure and it's not a stand-alone treatment. However, when Kratom is combined with other natural and healthy steps towards a better life, it can significantly aid the user in achieving and maintaining sobriety as well as reducing chronic pain, anxiety and depression. Many people would benefit from more studies being done on Kratom. Quite possibly we could find that Kratom is the key to unlocking this country's opiate epidemic. I request that the DEA/US FDA approach Kratom scientifically by performing studies to help further explore the use of Kratom in the United States while allowing it to remain available to people during that process.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0757","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Levi Beers","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nLet's check it out before we ban it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21836","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robin Pappas","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"While this drug might be beneficial and non addictive to some people, for others it is highly addictive and makes them mean a few hours after they have ingested it and the next day when they don't have any.

My doctor did not want to prescribe addictive painkillers, as I agreed. My blood tests indicated high liver enzymes, most likely caused from the Tylenol, as indicated by my doctor. I  found Kratom on the internet. I researched as much as possible, as well as presented the anecdotal evidence of efficacy to my Doctor. I made a reluctant decision to order some. I was pleasantly suprised with the benefits I had obtained from the Kratom. My doctor recently ran blood tests and was pleased to see that my liver enzymes have returned to normal. I feel better than ever.

He was a great athlete, great student, well liked by everyone, and when he had kids, I saw how good of a father he was.  Several years ago he was injured in a car accident and hurt his back really bad.  While it made him less active and less fit, he was still himself for the first year. However, as time went on and the doctors put him on stronger and strong opioid painkillers, he started to fade into a shadow of his former self.  He never looked rested, he rarely smiled, he talked less and just did not look well most of the time.  This kept getting worse and worse and he finally moved onto harder opiates like heroin.  He used heroin for two years until it got so bad we had to send him to rehab.  He went and go out but he still needed to manage the pain but instead of painkillers he found an herbal supplement called kratom.  Not only did it allow him to manage his pain but it gave him energy, allowed him to focus, he was smiling again and it allowed him to feel like himself for the first time in years.  \n\n\nOver the last two years, he has returned to the big brother I always looked up too and a big part of that is being able to take kratom to manage his pain.  When the ban was proposed, he was scared to death and so was I.  I am still scared because I dont know what happens to my brother if this ban goes through.  I just know he needs something for his pain and supplements are better than narcotics.  No matter what you classify kratom as, it will be nothing more than an herbal supplement.  Except for some reason, you may decide people should go to prison for it.  If he has to go back to pain pills, he will wind up taking heroin again because those with pain get to a point where the medications do not work.  Is that what you want?  To make the opiate crisis worse?  Because this is how you do it and if you ban, someone will end up dying from an overdose that had previously been clean.  I not only worry that will happen but I worry that my brother may be the one and I dont want to have to see his daughters lose their father because their government made an awful mistake.

Based on my research, it doesn't appear that there is sufficient justification to make kratom illegal (or a schedule one drug).  I found that there is a dearth of information about kratom within the scientific literature.  In my opinion this lack of information kratom should not be used as a basis for making it illegal or a schedule one drug.  A lack of information about kratom is not evidence of kratom being dangerous.  To the contary I have spoken with about a dozen people who regularly use kratom.  Many of these people use kratom because it helps them stay calm and reduces their pain so they can get through the day.  Many of these people were taking prescription opiates that had extreme risks of dependency and made them feel groggy in a way that kratom doesn't (since it's effect is allegedly extremely mellow).  Many of these people have been benefiting from the medicinal effects of kratom for years and in some cases over a decade...to take that medicinal benefit away from people without sufficient evidence of a danger posed to the American public by Kratom is a miscarriage of justice.\n\nTo be 100% clear, I have not used kratom or any illegal drug for that matter...heck I generally tell my doctor not to prescribe me anything because I will refuse to take it unless it is absolutely necessary and not being prescribed for palliative reasons...I barely drink coffee or alcohol.  So I don't have \"a dog in this fight.\"  \n\nWhether you ban kratom or not it will not effect my life in any way but I recognize that a kratom ban will likely HURT some of my fellow Americans.  On that basis I cannot in good conscious sit idly by without saying something about this.\n\nThis country and society is clearly moving to a rationalization that while highly dangerous drugs should remain illegal, relatively safe recreational drugs (or supplements such as Kratom) should be legal.  Let's be honest with each other Marijuana will be nationally legal within 12 years for recreational/medicinal purposes.  There is no need to double down on the failed policies of the past by banning a substance that has clear medicinal benefits with essential zero risk of serious side effects.  (Yes, I read about the 15 deaths over the last 2 years, the vast majority of which appear to be due to a cocktail of drugs and/or suicide).\n\nThe arc of history is long but it bends toward justice.  Throwing people in jail for using and selling kratom will not make this country safer, it will not help anyone.  Rather, it will literally hurt people, who benefit from the medicinal benefits of kratom, and you'll create a new class of non-violent, otherwise law abiding, offenders.  Please, don't create more injustice by establishing a regulation that will result in honest/hard working people going to jail for a non-violent offense.\n\nIn closing, please don't double down on the mistakes of the past by banning a substance (schedule 1) that has clear medicinal benefits with little, if any, serious side effects.  Further, there is no rational/factual basis for banning Kratom.  Wait until there is sufficient scientific research to draw a factual conclusion about Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12430","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Philip Hammarberg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Health Benefits Of Kratom Leaves\n\nSome of the most interesting health benefits of kratom leaves include their ability to lower blood pressure, relieve pain, boost metabolism, increase sexual energy, improve the immune system, prevent diabetes, ease anxiety, help with addiction, eliminate stress, and induce healthy sleep.\n\nKratom Leaves\nNative to Southeast Asia, kratom is a tropical deciduous tree that is widely used throughout the region for medicinal purposes. The scientific name of this evergreen tree is Mitragyna speciosa, and it has had a very interesting history, including being banned in Thailand (despite being indigenous there), as it was a natural substitute for opium, thereby affecting the economy of the country. It does have many morphine-like effects, but that isnt where the benefits of kratom leaves ends. Also, there is no addictive quality of kratom leaves, which is very valuable given some of its long-term applications for human health.kratomleaf\n\nThe majority of the health benefits of kratom leaves are derived from the unique chemical compounds and nutrients found within the leaves of the plant, including a wide range of alkaloids and other organic substances that affect many of the organ systems of the human body. The plants leaves are widely chewed in countries where the tree grows naturally, and some high estimates suggest that up to 70% of the male population of Thailand chew anywhere from 10-60 leaves each day. The calming, soothing effects, as well as the undeniable health benefits of the leaves, are clearly positive in nature, which is what causes such a controversy. Essentially, kratom leaves are a substitute for opium, a highly addictive and dangerous drug, yet these leaves are seen as perfectly harmless, as regular as having a snack between meals. Now, lets take a closer look at some of the fascinating health benefits of kratom leaves.\n\nHaving experience kratom myself, I can attest to this information. \n\nSource: https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/other/kratom-leaves.html","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17907","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Shopen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be made illegal.

I bought some on a whim and was very impressed with moderate boost to energy and focus it gave me. I've often described it as the best cup of coffee you can find. I find it to be a complete and total replacement to coffee and energy drinks in the morning and a great addition to trail mix while out hiking. This is the crux of the matter, kratom is merely a small step above the many energy promoting products already on the market. From coffee, to caffeine pills, to yerba matte and the many things in between kratom is really no different. Like anything I'm sure it could be abused, but so too can caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, computer duster, markers, cough syrup and God knows what else that is sold on the shelves of super markets.\n\nWe are adults and we deserve the ability to choose what we put in our body particularly when that material or product is so incredibly safe. Especially in comparison to they many, many things that are clearly not safe yet are readily available and easy to attain.\n\nRegards,\nDrew Morris","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20994","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Morris","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The Protection, safety and wellbeing of the American people is first and foremost it's paramount However the last thing this glorious Republic needs is another regulation, a true free Republic with true free independent citizens doesn't need you to decide for them.

I am requesting that you please NOT put kratom on any list of schedule 1 controlled substances, as it has been a miracle to me in management of pain from arthritis, disk degeneration in my spine, and the cumulative effects of injuries from a collision with a car. ( I was 15 at the time, and riding a bike. )  I am an artist, and before I began using kratom 3 years ago at the suggestion of a friend, my pain usually prevented me from getting around very well, and had gotten bad enough to even prevent my doing yard work outside in my yard. I had been using prescription pain medicine, but as time passed, the pain killing effects lessened, and the horrible effects of addiction to the medication forced me to find a natural alternative, and once I tried kratom, and up to this very moment, I am amazed at the safety, affordability and effectiveness of it, in literally 'returning my life to me' after years of debilitation and misery. An artist needs concentration for his work, and before kratom it became increasingly difficult to do my job, as constant pain in my joints and back prevented this, and I began losing jobs because I could not meet deadlines. Upon using kratom, I got back a pain free life I hadn't had in many years, and was able to concentrate on my work once again, as relaxation and motivation returned to my life. I have never had adverse effects from the kratom, only benefit. It has given me my life back, and I desperately don't want to return to the hell of prescription pain medications. Please, I implor you, keep kratom legal, as it's been a 'God send to me.  Thank you for hearing me.

I am an approximately 40-50 year old professional who owns his own company. We employ a number of people in the professional services (HR) industry.\n\nI am opposed to the DEA putting kratom on the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances. I started using Kratom about 4 years ago. I have been treated for \"Attention Deficit Disorder\" (\"ADD\") for decades, and eventually grew weary of depending on Adderall, or Concerta, or Ritalin, Vyvanse - all of the pharmaceutical options for treating ADD. Those are *okay* options and I'm grateful they exist, but I never really felt fully healthy when taking them.\n\nI wanted an herbal or natural alternative that would leave me with few or no side effects, that I could quit taking periodically without feeling withdrawals, and which the best evidence I could find would indicate no short or long-term damage. \n\nThe pharmaceutical options are relatively safe, but would leave me fatigued, if I wanted to stop them, I would experience withdrawal, and the verdict is out on whether my long-term use caused any damage (doubtful). Their effect would fade as I built up tolerance and I felt like I was just kind of poisoning myself.\n\nKratom has treated my symptoms in a subtle way and allowed me to go without pharmaceuticals. I've tried Kratom WITH pharmaceuticals, and without. And don't need the pharmaceuticals. Perhaps because my doses may be low, but I don't feel fatigued after taking it, withdrawals are no concern when I stop taking it, and it helps me keep the focus I need in order to run and co-manage my business. I take 1.5 tsp every 4 - 5 hours and for ME it provides the same therapeutic relief as the pharmaceuticals. My dose does not change, nor does its' effectiveness seem to.\n\nAs I have combined Kratom with my other life-style processes, I have a solution that works for me. I imagine there are many others in similar situations as mine. I do not want to go back to pharmaceuticals as a long-term solution to my needs, and believe me, I have taken \"non-medicine\" ownership of my \"condition\" and it is working.\n\nI have read studies describing both the benefits and negatives of it; for me it works, and again, I hope you do not make it a Schedule 1 controlled substance, to me it doesn't seem to fit the criteria. And I hope that research monies are committed somehow (though not your domain) to fully researching it's potential, if it is made a Schedule 1 substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9657","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John W","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi,\n\nI am in favor of keeping Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13968","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Franklin Torres","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern\n\nMy name is Peter Woerner.

I have been using Kratom for about a year. It has drastically reduced the amount of migraines I get per month. I was not functioning before taking Kratom. I would get about 20 migraines per month. I tried many different pharaceuticals to prevent them. I am prescribed Imitrex, but only allowed 9 a month. I used to go through 9 and try to buy imitrex from a friend who has migraines. I lived in fear of the next one. My husband was resentful, my kids were sad that I was always sick. No I get 2 m migraines per month. One with ovulation and the other menstruation.  Kratom has changed my life for the better. I am forever grateful to this plant. I now feel strong enough to start working and going back to school. My 82 year old mother tried it and loved it. It helped her get off heavy pain killers like Oxycontin and Vicodin. But she has since stopped because she is afraid it is going to be legal. She is back on the pills again. When she was off the pills and on the krater, it was like having my mom back again. She was vibrant and sharp. Please, please don't make this illegal. This could help so many people. Its uses haven't even begun to be fully known. Think of all the heroin addicts that could be helped! Or people like my mother! Or me. Kratom has saved me.

The only reason why someone would try and ban this herb, like coffee is because it takes away from the profit on such dangerous drugs , and maybe some like Advil too , but it is far from a narcotic and as a matter of fact, it only works if you work it.  I had a friend in recovery who was just about to go back to her doctor after to get her \"legal\"  prescriptions of oxycodone , because she was in pain , so I decided to try and see if she would drink a cup of Kratom tea.   She drank two, and felt nothing, and she complained and said it was bullshit , just like anyone else who doesn't use it to be better because it doesn't even offer a high feeling .  When I had it for the first time, it felt like maybe my first cup of coffee but then it becomes just like coffee really.    I entered recovery 4 years ago because I didn't like what the drugs do to me, not because I was scared to die or wasn't having a fun time.   I wanted to feel whole again so I wouldn't be drinking a cup of Kratom tea if I got anything more out of it .   Please, help us keep the Kratom .  You will be saving lives.   This world has gone too far to the point where people are dying, kids because they don't know better.   The more real things taken away, the more people die.   I know first hand because in 2006, I got introduced to oxycodone because Vicodin was hard to get .  Next thing I know, I was wishing I would even be able to feel a Vicodin because it became too weak.  People are doing heroin because it's cheaper, and oxycodone is hard to get now.   More people die now, because when you take real heroin away, people get fake heroin, which equals death.  There has been a huge mistake down the line to help people , please help it not to be worse\nI believe in a good system , but if Kratom gets banned, I will be staying away from ANYTHING FDA approved because I just won't trust it.   I speak not only for myself, but mostly everyone I know who uses Kratom.   I like how , and when I purchase it , so if it needed a prescription, i wouldn't use it      thank you for your time,;please someone do the right thing , and just leave things alone.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9809","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Curcio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In 2008 when I began taking kratom tea and capsules as a possible therapy for clinical depression and debilitating anxiety.  Previous to that time, Id been treated with 3 different SSRIs - Paxil, Zoloft and Celexa - all of which had negative effects, and one - Zoloft - severe side-effects, including a marked exacerbation of my symptoms to a point in which I was almost hospitalized. I was especially concerned with Celexa because the FDA has issued a warning concerning long QT syndrome at doses of >40mg.\n\nSince taking kratom at a daily dose of 3 grams and rarely exceeding that level, my depression and anxiety have subsided markedly.  I can function, I feel better equipped to deal with the dark forces of depression which have dogged me for years, and I was essentially medication and drug free now.  I should also note that prior to kratom, I had been abusing alcohol on a daily basis but my cravings and urge to drink now are completely under control. During the past 2 years, Ive lost 40 pounds from a previously obese weight of 213; I cycle 30 miles and run 5 per week, and Im in the best physical condition of my life. I am absolutely convinced that these positive changes are directly and unequivocally linked to kratom. I am thus urging the DEA to seriously reconsider its decision; I am greatly disturbed by the prospect of not having legal access to a healing plant which I am convinced has given me a new lease on life and frankly, I would find a return to anti-depressants a nightmare scenario.  And I also strongly urge the DEA to allow, at the very least, public input from citizens such as myself who have not only used kratom for years with no ill effects whatsoever, but who have also responsibly and intelligently reviewed the available evidence, finding no hard scientific facts which are any cause for concern whatsoever in the free choice to take this God-given plant.

I am a 27 year old entrepreneur, currently running a successful video production business in California. I live a healthy, active lifestyle, work to preserve our environment and try to promote peace to those around me and also through my work. In addition to all of these attributes, I am also a regular user of Kratom, or Mitragyna speciosa. \n\nI am writing to you today to share some of the very positive effects Kratom has had on my life since I began using it in July of 2015. I first looked to Kratom as a healthier alternative to coffee because of its stimulating effects while not containing caffeine. And since then, the use of Kratom has vastly improved my sense of motivation, alertness and most noticeably my work ethic. For me, it truly does promote a sense of well being and encourages a positive outlook on the world. Now the true redeeming attribute is that Kratom can do all of this in small doses without any sedation or noticeable side effects. Since I started using Kratom, I have become exponentially more productive, my business is thriving, I am getting amazing reviews from coworkers and my romantic relationship has become more stable and loving. All of this, plus kratom has virtually eliminated my past habits of consuming alcohol and smoking cigarettes. While it could seem that I now simply take Kratom regularly instead of these other common vices, but it does not serve the same purpose as these other vices did, which were inherently indulgent and became habits through physical addiction. And now, the huge list of negative effects from these other habits has not only been eliminated, but has been replaced a slew of very desirable attributes.\n\nIt is my firm belief that Kratom should not only be kept legal, but intensely studied for medicinal purposes and hopefully promoted in the future as a method of rehabilitation for individuals addicted to drugs, alcohol or cigarettes, depression and overall low energy. It seems to me that this ban of Kratom could lead to a repeat story to that of Cannabis, where a potentially lifesaving natural substance was illegalized before its full medicinal potential had been discovered. I also fear that placing Kratom under Schedule 1 regulations will force the product and ultimately the industry into the hands of criminals who will undoubtedly try to continue importing Kratom, which will promote more international crime activity. \n\nI know that I am not alone in my support of Kratom use. And I know I stand with thousands of constructive members of society that are able to reach their full potential and positively impact the world around them with the help of this organic substance. Similar to coffee or yerba mate, Kratom has the potential to positively impact the economy of the rural areas where it is produced and therefore improve the quality of life for not only individuals, but whole cultures around the world via fair trade systems.\n\nSo today, I plead with the members of the DEA to keep Kratom legal, and do this with the consideration of those whose lives have been changed for the better because of this plant and in consideration of those who will be positively affected by Kratom in the future. Think of all the junkies that could be saved from their addictions, the aging grandparents who find new vibrance in life, or the sharp entrepreneurs who are better equipped to promote their  businesses and create more jobs for the future --  these are the people who will make the worth of Kratom much greater than the sum of its parts.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21608","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Seth Naugle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Normally I would not get involved in something like this, but I feel so strongly on this topic that I don't think I could live with myself if I did not speak up.\n\nKratom is an incredible plant with a myriad of potential benefits to the medical community. I don't claim to be a doctor, but I do try to stay as informed as possible on topics that I think are important, and kratom is no different. Through the many hours of research I have done on kratom, it seems pretty clear to me that the benefits of this plant far outweigh the negatives. The preliminary research on kratom shows its tremendous potential in areas related to mood stabilization, anxiety, depression, opioid maintenance, opioid tolerance reduction, PTSD disorder, and many more. For the DEA to make kratom a schedule 1 would be doing the American people a severe injustice, and I beg them to do their due diligence on kratom before writing it off as completely devoid of medical uses. If a layman researcher like myself (and I have always prided myself on my objective nature, so I am not a \"kratom fanboy\" by any means whatsoever) can find such promising data on kratom and it's medical uses, then I have no doubt the brilliant folks at the DEA can find it as well. Being the optimist that I am, I tend to believe the DEA does in fact have the American public's best intentions in mind, so I implore you, the DEA, to please give kratom the chance to undergo the necessary research before you destroy that opportunity forever by placing it on the Schedule 1 list of drugs. \n\nTo close the above thought, I would like mention a few destructive substances that, if they were illegal, would most definitely make the schedule 1 list. Those two well known substances are alcohol and tobacco. According to the Center for Disease Control, alcohol and tobacco together killed 120 times more American's in 2013 than all other drugs combined (I will provide a link to the source at the bottom of this document). This to me is a staggering statistic, and a group for which kratom does not belong. Kratom is closely related to the coffee plant, and while some reports vary, there doesn't seem to be a single death related to kratom use ONLY. All deaths supposedly related to kratom almost always involved other drugs, or in a few instances, substances that were passed as kratom but were in fact something else entirely (like the research opioid, O-Desmethyltramadol). In my opinion, if something should be considered a schedule 1 drug, it would be alcohol. I have seen first hand the destructive nature of alcohol, tobacco, heroin and cocaine, and kratom DOES NOT belong anywhere near this group of destructive substances. So, again, I beg the DEA to look at statistics like this and truly consider the ramifications of making kratom a schedule 1, because doing so would eliminate the possibility of further research into a plant that shows such promise. \n\nLastly, I would like to touch on my personal experience with kratom and how it positively affected my life. When I was 19 I had to have surgery for something called Meckel's Diverticulum. Due to the immense amount of pain, I was administered high doses of powerful pain meds during my time in the hospital. To help ease the transition off the pain killers, I was discharged on 10mg Percocets administered 3 times daily. \n\nThis ultimately kicked off a multi-year prescription opioid addiction, and one that I could not get salvation from. That is, until I found kratom. Where everything else had failed, kratom succeeded. I used the plant for roughly 3 weeks and then stopped. Miraculously, the withdrawals were mild and manageable and I successfully detoxed off the opioids I could not seem to kick.\n\nToday, I am a full time college student who is nearly finished with my B.S. in Computer Science from a very accredited Michigan university. I am on track to graduate with honors, and my plan is to complete my graduate work at Northwestern University in Chicago. I can say with 100% confidence that this would not have been possible without kratom. It literally saved my life. \n\nI am not a current kratom user, but I still have such a great respect for it because of what it did for me. Please, DEA, I beg you to try and look at kratom from a completely objective viewpoint. I strongly believe that banning this plant will be detrimental to not only the American people, but the medical community as well. Thank you. \n\nTobacco, Alcohol Deaths:\n\nwww.mysanantonio.com/lifestyle/health-family/article/Drugs-contributed-to-over-515-000-deaths-in-the-6073450.php\n\nPotential Medical Benefits of kratom:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161128132148.htm","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21372","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick Kelly","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello. I am writing to you on behalf of kratom, an herb that has greatly enriched my life since i started consuming it. \n\nFirst off, i am a 19 year old full-time college student who works part time as well. I started taking it in the summer of 2015 simply as a curiosity. I realized that i could use it both for a clean, energizing boost during the day as well as a way to relax and unwind in the evening, depending on dose and strain, of course. It allows me to be more productive and focused, perfect for studying or being at work. It also helps reduce symptoms of my ulcerative colitis, which i take additional medication for (lialda).  I have experienced no negative side effects aside from occasional mild constipation which is easily reversable.\n     What infuriates me the most is how the dea classifies it as an 'opiate' or 'opioid'. IT IS NOT DERIVED FROM THE POPPY PLANT, NOR IS IT SYNTHETIC. I have taken vicodin and codeine. There is a huge distinction between between kratom and opiates; namely, that kratom is not intoxicating, nor is it addictive. It provides a calm, non-jittery energy boost that i prefer over coffee or adderall. And, unlike adderall, kratom does not have a 'come down', probably because of how benign it is :)\n\nAll that said, it is in my opinion that kratom should not be banned, but rather it should be regulated so that dubious vendors no longer adulterate it or call it a 'legal high.\" Thank you for reading!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2859","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Tuskey","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is James Estes (70) and my wife is Diana Estes (68).  We are both retired.  Our son, Jonathan (36) is self-employed.\nOur position is that Kratom is a natural, God given botanical substance that has too many medicinal benefits to be outlawed for American adults use.  Not only should it not be put on the DEA Schedule 1, it should be removed from the watch list and be allowed to be freely available to the public as any other supplements without a doctors prescription.  In addition, FDA restrictions in every form such as import limitations, customs scrutiny and holds, as well as restricted access to bank services for vendors should be abolished.\nMy wife has used Kratom for a couple of years, ever since she became aware of it to relieve terrible back pain and fibromyalgia, as well as to once again enjoy renewed energy.  Our son has used it for several years for anxiety and depression, as well as recurring muscle pain.  Neither have experienced any negative side effects from the various strains they have used.  \nIn addition, I have personally heard from many other users that could not do without it.  They have found that it has dramatically helped them to overcome opiate addictions caused by abuse, as well as medications given to them by medical doctors for pain after surgeries and accidents (i.e., automobile, industrial, and the like).  Without it they have no non-drug alternative to stay off substances like opiates and heroin.  It is a certain death decree for some of them if it is banned.  Others tell how they have used it for migraine and everyday headaches.  One banker shared how his boss was out of aspirin and he offered him some Kratom.  Within minutes his boss came back in and told him his headache was amazingly gone.  And, others tell how they used it effectively as a sleep aid, for relaxation, and mood enhancement.  These are not hearsay, but actual emails from people we know.   And, interestingly, there was no discussion of negative side effects from long-term users, just praise for the good they experienced.\nIn September 2016, the DEA stated that Kratom should be put on Schedule 1 because of supposed related death and calls to emergency services.  Since then it has been proven that other hard drugs were involved with the cited deaths, not just Kratom.  Calls to emergency per year were about a 135 average over five years.  However, these statistics were not shown or considered in comparison to other substances such as alcohol, sugar, and peanut butter to only mention a few which make Kratom stats insignificant.  And, what about 78,000 calls a year about bad reactions to Tylenol?  There was no comparisons at all to legal addictive drugs prescribed by doctors.\nThe DEA/FDA needs to forsake chasing after the low-hanging fruit of Kratom in your war against drugs.  Kratom is a dietary natural supplement, not a drug.  It can help fight the upsurge of opiate and heroine addictions.   It has been used for centuries around the world, and for decades in the US, for medical purposes.  Yes, any substance can be abused.  Case in point: look at alcohol to only mention one, and there are many more for which you have statistics, but they are not on Schedule 1!   Before Kratom is put on Schedule 1, or even left on the watch list, there should be supportable and comparable statistical, scientific evidence that it is in fact a dangerous substance.  What has been put forth so far does not meet that criteria.  It makes Kratom look like an amazing botanical, that it is, and should be available to all Americans.\nThere is a mass amount of literature about studies that have shown Kratom is safe for uncontrolled use by the public.  Canada undoubtedly has a library of literature as well as to why they made Kratom a legal supplement available to everyone north of our border.  The DEA/FDA has already received the epistle from the American Kratom Associations attorney as to the chemical makeup of natural Kratom leafs, which is similar to coffee, and other related facts that differentiates it from an opiate drug.  You are a government agency that has access to data and research capabilities way beyond our comprehension.    It is now time to step forward and abandon pharma and western medicine lobbyists influences, partisan pressures, and personal beliefs.

When I was 22 years old I was admitted to ER with severe abdominal pain. I found out that I had a condition know as Pancreatitis, where cysts had developed along the organ responsible for both regulating blood sugar and breaking down carbs, fats, proteins, etc. Pancreatitis is a notoriously painful condition and treatment requires heavy doses of painkillers. I was hooked up to a Dilaudid pump, which injected concentrated doses of a pain killer stronger than morphine directly into my blood stream. The pain in my abdomen was so intense however; that I needed to take Hydrocodone in addition, to simply mitigate some of the pain. Recovery from pancreatitis was a long and difficult journey. I lost over 20 lbs in 9 days in the ER and an additional 15 lbs throughout the next few months. In all I lost more than 35 lbs from the terrible condition. The pain from pancreatitis lingered for months and I continued taking opiates to simply find a degree of relief. My body grew dependent on the medication inevitably.  I eventually began experiencing withdrawal-like symptoms and sever depression if I did not take the medication. I was subsequently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder to which I credit (in part) the role that opiates played in deteriorating my well being. I was introduced to Kratom by a friend and was initially uninterested as I had assumed it was some \"legal smoke-shop drug\" that you hear about on the news. I was told that it was a natural plant and that it was completely safe, which sparked my curiosity. After some on my own research I concluded that Kratom did seem to be an alternative worth trying. I was willing to try almost anything to alleviate the dependence I had on the pain medication that was having such a negative impact on my life. Not only did Kratom alleviate the pain I experienced from Pancreatitis, but it also did wonders to restore my enjoyment and ambition that had been deteriorating. I take Kratom on a regular basis for its array of benefits. It has helped with my mood in a profound way. It comforts my physical ailments, whether pancreatic pain or a common headache. It has helped boost my appetite and restore my weight. I have never experienced negative side effects from Kratom, other than drowsiness which could also be beneficial on occasion. I have stopped my consumption of Kratom on multiple occasions and I can attest that my physical dependence on Kratom is relatively non-existent compared to that of the opiate medication. I can't understand why anyone would think that prohibiting an adult from taking care of their own mind and body with natural remedies is acceptable. Kratom is a wonderful plant with numerous beneficial qualities. I truly hope your Department honestly and fairly considers the evidence. Kratom has made my life and the lives of countless others, profoundly improved. Listen to what the people are saying. Listen to what the facts are saying. Listen to what nature is saying. Please save Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3027","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Betts","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am against the scheduling of Kratom.

It helps gently improve my mood with no side effects or increased tolerance.   \n\nI am extremely against the classification of Kratom as a controlled substance.

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nI'd hope that you'd know how it works, being as the organization is trying to supress the herb, but, here's how Kratom works: Kratom uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6. In the long-run, if someone's getting a pay-off for stopping Kratom, they could eventually also make money from Kratom.\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes that Thailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects. Here's a link to use for that: http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v.\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But, it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms (as in opiates). Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I am 37 years old and am married with children. In 2015 I Jade ACDF spine surgery. I did not recover well but wished to limit narcotic medications they make me feel unwell and depressed if taken for more than a few days at a time. Kratom allowed my pain to be controlled while remaining active and able to not feel drugged or sleepy. It truly increased the quality of life. Then in February 2016 the unthinkable happened. \n\nMy ACDF from a Mayo Clinic surgeon failed- my hardware had broken and I developed an abcess and perforated my esophegus. I had several weeks in the hospital with a central line, feeding tube and muscle flap repair. I was medicated on heavy narcotics while in the hospital but with the subsequent emergency surgeries I was left with debilitating chronic pain.\n\n I've pursued all the avenues offered to me by modern medicine that I feel comfortable with. Trigger point injections, vitamins and diet, excersize, physical therapy. One thing has kept me active and has helped me regain a normal life by offering a mild, clean feeling, non sedating pain control : KRATOM. I order from online vendors I trust and also pick some up at the local cigar shop in Minnesota.\n\n I am busy with my ladies Bible study's, Church group, my children's school activities, and have even regained the strength again to do gentle sports like canoeing and archery. I'm too young to be on dangerous narcotics like fentanyl or oxycodone. The withdrawl is horrible and being on narcotics leaves me feeling like I'm not present mentally or physically. And they are dangerous. Kratom needs to stay legal in all 50 states. I've never had one negative reaction in the last year and a half of taking it. I couldn't drive on narcotics. I am well.

I live with my 85-year old Mother, who is my primary caretaker, and have been unable to function in the workplace for the past 8 years, my only source of income being Social Security Disability.\n\nBy way of extensive Internet research of depression-related forums, I learned of the plant-based psychotropic substance Kratom. After my very first use of this substance a little over a week ago, it was if my chronically and severely depressed brain was 'reset' --- an observation made by my psychotherapist for the last 9 years. He compared my outcome from that very first Kratom ingestion with that of ElectroConvulsive Therapy (ECT). During my first visit following my initial use of Kratom, I genuinely smiled twice during our session, a facial expression my therapist had never previously seen during our many years of working together. \n\nTraditional psychiatry has failed me on every occasion in terms of brightening my mood and alleviating my persistent sense of dread, whereas Kratom pulled me out of the depths of MDD after only the one usage of the substance.\n\nI plead with the DEA to end all efforts to label Kratom as an illegal substance. I was in an unrelenting and downward spiraling of my mood, and truly believed that were it to continue, I would have no choice but to end my life. Kratom has literally eliminated that sense of impending doom. Placebo effect? Extremely unlikely for 2 reasons: 1) I have had high hopes for a number of new medications I have been on only to experience failure, and 2) I did not have much confidence at all that an herbal remedy could outperform thoroughly tested and FDA-approved medications. \n\nTake away Kratom, and I fear I would once again fall into the downward spiral that had but one eventual, and tragic, action to escape the clutches of severe, chronic, and treatment resistant depression.\n\nRegards,\nGary Mordini\ngary.mordini@gmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12636","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gary Mordini","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not believe that this new regulation is necessary or appropriate.

In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

The only people who have ever died from Kratom have had other dangerous drugs in their system as well. Kratom alone has never killed ANYONE.\n\nThank you for your time and thank you for your service to this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21474","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Lee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Without kratom i would not be a functioning member of society.

A little over 10 years ago, I attempted suicide 5 times in one year. The pain, anxiety, and depression got to be more than I could tolerate. I thank God I was unsuccessful, however, now what? I asked myself again and again? The Rx's were not working and made me terribly ill. One morning, after the boys got on the bus, feeling the most destitute I'd ever been, I searched for a way to \"make it look like an accident\", but found Kratom instead. Searching for a way to end my life, turned into a way to save it. This beautiful plant had preserved my life and gave me back to my family. However, this proposed ban, will put me back into the line of fire. Please don't load the gun! I cannot go back to this life. The prescribed medications have terrible side effects and make it difficult to be a productive member of society or to find joy in life. With Kratom, I am active, healthy, hopeful, present, productive, and happy for my family. I'm terrified to return to my pre-Kratom life. \n\nIn my opinion, Kratom should remain where it is now. Legal, all natural, \"over the counter\", and in a place where it can be properly researched and/or studied. Why change it? It's helping people get clean and sober. It IS saving lives now. It's currently helping, not hurting. It isn't addictive, nor does it make you 'high'. Kratom has never the sole cause of overdose, nor is it dangerous. It's never, alone, been responsible for any deaths. I'm afraid if Kratom is banned or scheduled, the opiate epidemic numbers will go up exponentially. Our veterans rely on Kratom to help them with PTSD. I'm afraid for my friends' lives. I'm afraid for my life and what it will become without this plant....","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1038","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laurel Eaton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you very much for withdrawing this motion against kratom.

I used to be a massage therapist, professional pianist, photographer, and video editor. However, my condition affects my right hand, arm, and shoulder and I am no longer able to keep up with all my previous professions. Kratom has helped me so much and has nearly negated my need for opioid prescriptions to function. It is less expensive, less harmful, and the effects are even more beneficial. \nI am so grateful that a friend with back pain told me about kratom. Our prescription drug use has plummeted and I have also stopped abusing alcohol during mood swings and times of anxiety. I am also treated for bipolar type II and my use of benzodiazepines have also plummeted. \nPlease continue to listen to the pain community as you have.

Last year, around this time, I was hit off of my motorcycle by a distracted driver who swerved into the opposite lane, hitting me head on at 45 mph. Despite being properly geared, I still suffered multiple injuries that included a broken leg, arm, hip, and pelvis, all of which currently have had hardware put into them. I had to learn how to walk again, and use my arm correctly, and while I am on the road to a full recovery, every day can be a struggle because of the pain these weak points give me. I was prescribed oxycodone, hydrocodone, and Flexeril to deal with these problems, and they certainly help with the pain, the side affects greatly outweigh the benefits. The thought of addiction scared me so much, as I've lost close friends and family members to it. \n\nThis is where kratom comes into play for me. For a while I forced myself to deal with the pain until it was unbearable, and then I seeked alternatives. I found kratom and while I was a bit skeptical at first, I was blown away by how well it works at actually making me feel like I can function in every day life without pain. That, and without a high or withdrawal that prescription painkillers can give you. I only take kratom two or three times a week, only when needed, and it would devastate me if my right to have it legally would be taken away from me. I am strongly against a ban, as I'm sure is obvious in this comment. I believe that if there is concern in the eyes of the DEA, then more research should be done before doing anything like an emergency scheduling. To whoever reads this, thank you for taking the time out to hear me out, I am definitely hoping for the best as I do not want to be forced into possible addiction. America is in an opiate crisis as it is, I don't want myself or those I love to become statistics when there's something out there to help them in the same way as prescription drugs without risking their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17282","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Peter Quist.

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety , post traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, and pretty severe stomach pain from a handful of ulcers and iliitis.\n   At 14 my Mom died in my arms... At 17, in a blacked out state from alcohol, I stumbled into someone's home and attempted to take food out of their fridge because I was homeless. On my way out I attempted to steal a 72 in. television and dropped it, waking the home owners that chased me out with a hand gun. I was sentenced to 16 months in the Michigan Department of Corrections. I ended up doing close to 3 years. To this day I have nightmares of stabbings and death. I watched and partook in things no 17 year old should have to. I was at a point where i didnt care about anything. Losing my Mom, my best friend, my life, put me into a bad state of mind. I gave up.\n    I was released from prison in January 2015. For about a year I was still acting foolishly and getting into trouble; I was scared, and I was lost. \n    Since then, I feel like I have found myself in a sense. And since then, I discovered Kratom. I've took Kratom daily for almost a year. I couldn't have imagined I would be where I am today a year ago. I wouldn't have thought a leaf could help me so Substantially! My PTSD is still pretty bad, but it is remarkable how much Kratom had helped it. I have not drank alcohol in almost a year either thanks to the help of this amazing plant. It dulls the sharp stomach pains I get on a daily basis.. and the depression/anxiety is almost unnoticeable these days. \n   My life has literally turned around since I started taking Kratom.

It improves lives by helping recovering addicts compensate with a harmless supplement. I use it to relax after a stressed out week in place of alcohol because it makes me more social and I don't feel bad in the morning. I have never been addicted to it, nor do I see much potential for addiction. Yes, I like the way it makes me feel, but taking more will not elicit a stronger feeling. In the morning I feel refreshed, but I don't feel like I need to have more or crave it. When I heard it was going to be illegal, I easily abstained from consuming it for 2 months because I wanted to conserve the little I had left. \n\nI think people get the idea that kratom enthusiasts take a bunch of it and then \"veg out\" for hours. At least for my friends that enjoy it and myself, kratom is just a way to improve experiences. The well-being experienced while taking kratom helps introverts overcome anxiety to talk to new people; the enhanced positive feeling helps ingrain memories more deeply, from simple acts like riding a train with friends to ice skating. \n\nKratom is also very safe. There have not been hospitalizations in which kratom is the sole contributor to the pathology; it is always a case of mixing kratom with \"hard drugs.\" Adding a warning to not consume kratom with other drugs should be sufficient to assure its safety. There are hundreds of over-the-counter drugs that can have serious interactions when taken with other OTC drugs, but warning labels are all the FDA requires. For instance, nearly 500 people died in 2015 due to acetaminophen-induced liver failure with thousands more hospitalized, but no one is crying for tylenol to be taken off the shelves. I can confidently say that kratom is safer than most OTC drugs on the market, which shouldn't make safety a concern. \n\nIn conclusion, kratom improves the lives of thousands worldwide. It has a low potential for abuse and addiction, and is safe. Banning it in a time when drug laws are increasingly getting more lax with substances like THC makes no sense, and moving it to schedule I makes absolutely no sense. Keep kratom legal; let people enjoy their lives a little bit.

Simply put, kratom is a benign substance. It is a completely safe and natural plant that has provided not only myself, but innumerable others with a better quality of life. Additionally, kratom is not an addictive substance or one that is in any way a risk to public safety. If the DEA continues with their plan to schedule kratom, it will not only erode trust and relations between citizens and the DEA, but will detrimentally effect thousands of law-abiding, contributing members of our society. \n    I began supplementing with kratom two years ago. I had overcome one the most difficult times in my life - - a drug addiction. In treatment, I was prescribed an opiate maintenance drug known as Suboxone. I had taken Suboxone for around a year, but there were many side effects which hindered my quality of life and ability to perform day to day functions. As an opiate, Suboxone also carried with it the risk of overdose through respiratory depression and potential for abuse, along with being equally as physically addictive as other opiates. Not long after, I did not want to be on Suboxone. I wanted to live a normal life; however,I found that getting clean from my prescribed opiate maintenance drug was even harder to quit than my original drug of choice. I didn't want to be on Suboxone anymore though, so I did some research and found a natural supplement called kratom. Kratom was a miracle for me. It allowed me to get off of Suboxone without having to miss work. I found that I could lead a normal and productive life with the help of kratom, with no risk of harm to my health and no risk of addiction. Without kratom, my life would in a much worse place. I finally finished up my bachelor's degree, am looking into graduate school for a doctorate, and have a great job bartending and managing a restaurant. \n     I understand that the DEA's ultimate goal is to help protect US citizens. It's a difficult and admirable job; however their efforts to schedule kratom are misguided. Kratom is a wonderful alternative to potentially harmful substances, and have provided countless people with a new lease on life. This scheduling effort represents an unprecedented overreach of the DEA and the federal government, and following through will damage relations among the DEA and the general public. Together, we can prevent immeasurable hardship on thousands of people by allowing kratom to remain legal. We can mend and strengthen relations between the general public and government agencies like the DEA if we listen to common sense, scientific/empirically backed data, and public sentiment. Ignoring those key factors in an effort to overregulate will only hurt law abiding citizens in the Kratom community and further tarnish public perception of the DEA. it's time for the DEA to focus its efforts on the actual dangerous substances and leave Kratom alone.

She has everything to lose and nothing to gain by the illegalization of kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3772","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Abigail Feria","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA, I would like to take this opportunity to write you in opposition of your upcoming decision related to the use of kratom in the US.  I was seriously dependant on opioid pain killers from a injury I had sustained while on active duty military.  there are several bad things with that as you well know. I started to seek alternative natural ways to deal with my chronic pain. That is when i found kratom. It allowed me to safely wean myself off of the prescriptions I was receiving from the VA. In my opinion it works better and lasts longer throughout  the day for relieving my discomfort without the feeling of being under the influence while on the job as a millwright at a sawmill.  I feel that it is not nearly as addictive, doesn't have as many side affects, and has benefitted me positively for several years now.  If you make it illegal for me, and others like me would create a severe hardship, and doesn't seem necessary.\n\nIn conclusion please make the right decision, and educate the public, and not take away this great natural, and safe herb.    \n\nSincerely,\n\nJeffrey P.

I also was hesitant to take OTC paint relievers because of potential damage to the liver and for relief and had to take double dose to even get a little pain relief. I was desperate to find something and came across kratom. It was a lifesaver!! I felt no high just normal without pain.\nNow I'm helpless in getting help for pain and I cannot physical therapy due to cost not to mention it did little if anything to ease my pain. Please please don't take away the only safe relief I have.

I strongly encourage the DEA to abandon all attempts to place kratom on a list of controlled substances (emergency or otherwise). Kratom has been used by humans for centuries and, for centuries, it has been safe and effective. Only in recent years have deaths or adverse reactions been attributed to Kratom usage, notably in the Western world and when used in the presence of pharmaceutical drugs. Indeed, the hysteria around the alleged deaths attributed to Kratom have been easily disproven. Even if the numbers were real, however, the amount of people who have had serious side effects from Kratom are miniscule. \n\nIn addition, Kratom has provided an avenue of escape from addiction for countless individuals. The number of people using Kratom to break the cycle of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, alcohol, and many other drugs is staggering. For the DEA to ban Kratom would be incredibly hypocritical and counterproductive for an agency that prosecutes the war on drugs and claims to want to rid the country of addictive and allegedly harmful substances.\n\nFurthermore, Kratom has been very important for many people in the control of pain and other health conditions that pharmaceuticals could either not control or produced too many side effects to use rationally. Many individuals suffering from Fibromyalgia and other chronic forms of pain are having their lives returned to them because of Kratom. \n\nLastly, in the United States of America, it is abhorrent that the DEA can even consider banning a plant and/or medicinal substances because of fear, misinformation, and paranoia. Free individuals have the right to consume plants if they so desire. If they are not free to do so, then they are not truly free. \n\nI am asking for rationality and reason to be applied to this decision and for the DEA to immediately back off its plan to ban kratom. We are not looking for a ban and further research nor are we looking for legalization with a prescription from a doctor. We are looking for what we have had all along  free access to a safe, effective, plant that has returned so many lives to people who had previously lost hope.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20158","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Turbeville","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not put a ban on Kratom plant.

It is not distilled or refined, just as these other herbs are not distilled or refined.  \n\nIt is not dangerous. Every report that I have read about kratom \"deaths\" has actually involved other dangerous drugs. It is impossible to say that kratom caused these deaths, when any injury is more likely to be related to one of the other substances that the person had injested. Alcohol is a very, very dangerous substance. It kills many, many people every year. Yet alcohol is not scheduled. People are allowed to take their own risks with alcohol, which is really only consumed socially. People should also be free to take their own risks with herbal remedies, such as kratom.\n\nThe War on Drugs is a failure - and plans to schedule kratom are an extension of this failed war. Many people enjoy kratom very much, as a normal cup of tea, or as a replacement for coffee. If you make kratom possession a felony, some of these people will simply choose to risk becoming felons. This will contribute to a further decay of our families. Children need parents, brothers need their sisters, and we all need each other. Kratom consumers are very normal people with jobs and families. Incarcerating them for consuming a tea made from a leaf will destroy more lives than this tea leaf ever could. These sorts of policies lead to urban blight, cultural vaccums, and high crime rates. I do not support any of these things.     \n\nI believe that the DEA has been bought by pharmaceutical companies. This is not democratic. Pharmaceutical companies have contributed massive amounts of money to fight against medical marijuana campaigns. Regular citizens cannot keep up with these expensive campaigns. Seeing yet another herb banned because pharmaceutical companies do not like it is morally wrong. The compounds in Kratom are in the process of being patented. That indicates that they are valuable. The pharmaceutical industry does not want to lose this value. They want to take this herb away from Americans for their own financial gain. I am sick of our government selling us out to these corporations, and destroying our communities in the process. \n\nKratom is already a large industry. My hometown, St Petersburg FL, has 8 tea shops which sell kratom almost exclusively. Forcing these businesses to lose such a large source of revenue will likely cause them to shut their doors. These are small businesses run by regular Americans. It is unethical to jeopardize their businesses so that some pharmaceutical company can cash in on its patents. I am consistently shocked at how anti-small business our country actually has become. The DEA is now looking to play its part in shutting more tea houses, vendors, and putting more sales people out of jobs. I am very disappointed. \n\nSome claim that it is a powerful aly in the fight against opioid addiction. Opioid addiction is claiming many lives. I belive this to be the direct responsibility of pharmaceutical companies (who have pushed pills which were known to be addictive and death-causing) and the DEA. There are high recidivism rates among drug users because the prison system is not effective at helping or curing people of their addictions. The DEA simply arrests people and incarcerates them into a broken system. It destroys the families of those suffering from drug addiction, instead of helping them back into society. These people do not want to  be addicts. But they are not being helped in any way. Instead of addressing this issue, the DEA wants to make another herb a criminal offense, continuing this cycle of addiction and pain. SHAME on the DEA! \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0458","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie Alaimo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We don't need to create more criminals to prosecute and imprison for consuming a plant when opiates are a staggering problem.

After hearing the potential ban of Kratom, a supplement I have been using for well over 2 years, I was devastated, and could not understand why this wonderful plant could ever be defined as a schedule 1 narcotic. Kratom has helped me in many aspects in my life. Most importantly it has helped with my chronic back pain, that I have been experiencing since I was 17 years old; my injury was due to a weight lifting accident. I was a collegiate football player, and continued being active by running, and lifting weights well pass my college career. This passion to stay active has put me in the situation where pain is mandatory and inescapable. I have been through the standard painkiller prescriptions, and found no outlet that was beneficial to my life; in fact it was detrimental. Painkillers are extremely addictive, and not the solution for people who have chronic pain. Not to mention that I have had friends die from painkiller and heroin addiction. Painkillers are the gateway drug for heroin, which I am sure you are aware of. Kratom is not a drug, and is not addictive. It is simply a plant that is a relative of coffee, and has stimulating and painkilling side effects; it is not an opiate. If there were to be a ban, I don't know what my options would be to treat my pain. You would put me in the uncomfortable situation of wanting to break the law or live with crippling back pain. I know life isn't always fair, but I can't help but think how unfair it would be if the DEA decided to make Kratom a schedule 1. I can't make sense of it, and it selfishly feels as if life is out to get me. I would kindly ask you to not punish people for your lack of experience, and information about the plant. We fear what we don't know, so please educate yourself on Kratom, and I know you will feel similar to what I feel. Hopefully this plant can positively effect your life or a loved one, as it has done with me. Please do not ban Kratom, it has been a life saving, life changing supplement that many more people should be aware of. By allowing Kratom to stay legal you are literally saving lives. If you ban Kratom you will be putting many lives in danger. Again, please listen to the people in this comment period, and continue your knowledge on the subject. I would like to thank you for allowing the comment period, and I hope the Kratom community is being heard.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1633","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Maxwell Morris","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Before Kratom I had to go on a medical leave from my job due to severe anxiety and ptsd.

After 2 years of being physically dependent on opiates for back pain, I was switched to Suboxone for 7 years. When I quit Suboxone, it was a roller coaster ride from the abyss. I had severe physical and mental withdrawals for nearly 60 days and once those were over, other issues that I'd never had before taking Suboxone, lingered. It was very difficult dealing with the long term effects the Suboxone had left me with. Even after 2 years of being off Suboxone, I was having terrible insomnia, digestive issues (IBS), depression, lethargy, irritability, severe lack of motivation, anxiety, heart palpitations, high blood pressure,  and many other symptoms. Because I was TERRIFIED to take another prescription to try to counteract all these long term effects, I started researching online to find some relief in a natural, safe, healthy way. I had come across Kratom on many forums, but was reluctant to try this as I didn't want to end up back in the same boat I was with Opiates and/or Suboxone. But I was literally at my wits end. I made the decision that I would at least try it and see if I could get some relief. It was simply amazing how it turned everything around within a few hours of taking it the first time.  The first thing to go was the lethargy. I felt like getting up and getting started on projects or chores I'd been putting off for months or even years. Then I noticed the irritability and anxiety subsided greatly enough for me to want to start interacting with my family and friends again.  Basically, I got up off the couch and became productive and social. I hadn't had this in many, many years. It was a major undertaking just to get into the shower and go anywhere, besides work. I didn't feel like my thinking was clouded as it was on opiates/suboxone and I didn't have a craving to take more within a few hours.  To make this a schedule 1 drug is beyond comprehension to me. I can honestly see how people who have been physically dependent on opiates, might turn to Heroin to find relief.  Although I never went down that path, I cannot judge people who have because I \"Get\" what they're going through and desperate times cause people to take desperate measures. I truly believe this is a proven alternative to help those that may not have the resources or ability to take themselves out of the game, and enter a re-hab facility.  As a whole, we need more resources to help with the growing epidemic of opiate use, heroin use, etc.  Not to mention, this is great supplement for many who just need help with dealing with the things that might cause them to search out ways to fill voids; such as depression, anxiety, true physical pain, etc. I have not suffered ONE side effect from taking this natural supplement and I can go long periods of time without taking it and don't go into instant withdrawals like I have so many times before when taking prescription opiates. I truly pray everyday for an \"epiphany\" moment by the agencies that want to take this out of game. It will be extremely counterproductive to the end outcome.  This is about people's lives and should no longer be about who can make money off this God given plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13329","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nMy name is Bobby, I am 34 years old, and an ATM Repair Technician\n\nMy best friend for the last 28 years has always been one of the most fun, active, and joyful people I have ever known.  But, several years ago he hurt his back and it put a dent in that joyful person I knew.  But, he adjusted and went on until they kept giving him more and more painkillers and that person completely faded away until he was barely the man I had always known.  He finally decided he had had enough and got some treatment and off the painkillers.  But, he still had to find a way to kill that pain.  He found kratom, an herbal supplement, that is nothing more than a leaf off a tree that people have used for hundreds and hundreds of years.  \n\nWithin weeks he was back to the person I had known for the bulk of that 28 years and all it took was an inexpensive supplement that he could take everyday without side effects or risk of overdose.

The reason I was attracted to it is because I thought it could curb my desire to booze after work b/c I feel like that has become a habit I need help breaking.

I can think clearly and am alert, but have a slight euphoric feeling. The plant is super tame and a great alternative to cannabis, which for me, causes nausea and paranoia and I don't enjoy it at all. I think schedule 1 is much too severe for this plant.

I am unable to work as a paramedic while taking narcotic medications for obvious reasons. In researching options for inflammation and pain control, I discovered Kratom. The active ingredients in Kratom allow me to work and live a full life by addressing the painful inflammation and joint swelling associated with RA. If Kratom is scheduled, I will be forced into disability and will not be able to work in emergency services. \n\nAs a paramedic, I see the horrific crisis our nation has with narcotic pain medications. I see very young children overdose. I have had to tell a mother her son was dead, due to an opiate overdose . I do not feel comfortable having those drugs in my home and available to my children or their friends. While I have never suffered from addiction, I see numerous people that have become addicted to illicit narcotics, following a legal and necessary prescription for opiate pain medication. \n\nI completely disagree with the decision to include Kratom in to a C1 class. This tree has been safely used for thousands of years. I wish to maintain the freedom to choose natural, plant based therapy for my health conditions. Please careful consider this decision. There are literally millions of Americans that have chosen to use this plant. To date, there are no deaths that have been attributed only to Kratom. There is no evidence of respiratory depression associated with Kratom. There is little evidence of addiction. The same statements cannot be made of opiate based medicine.

There is no evidence that a user experiences any form of withdrawal when stopping Kratom abruptly. The same cannot be said for opiates. \n\nFinally, Kratom is not an opiate or benzodiazepine and should not be considered as such. There is no scientific evidence to show anyone has ever overdosed on Kratom. This is a safe and effective natural option for numerous conditions. \n\n\nSincerely, \n\nAllison Nelson, NRP","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7889","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Allison Nelson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello there!

I went three days cold turkey and was desperate to try to get my personality, sense of worth and life back. That's when I heard about Kratom.

When working long hours I use a low dose of this wonder plant to fight fatigue and provide a mood lift to give me a push for the day, however nothing compared to other recreational stimulants which have proven far more dangerous than kratom.  The Mitragyna speciosa deserves further research before jumping to ban it, as the only down side of this plant I have experienced has been dizziness and nausea and vomiting at a large dose, that being said, kratom deserves to be used with respect and moderation just like any other legal substances.  I have read an article that claims kratom is also in the same plant family as coffee! Another harmless (in moderation) brew enjoyed by many American and across the world alike.  This herb perhaps deserves a slight recognition instead of a jump to ban, with stimulating, painkilling, and mood lifting properties an little to no known related health issues from use.

In fact, I have several acquaintances who have discussed their issues we me at great length.\n\nIn each instance, these poor souls were weened off of opiates with other opiates or synthetics that emulated the effects of their chosen opiate based drug/s.\n\nThe acquaintances in question all began their sad journey by first taking prescribed medications. Some did so at a PCP's/GP's/MD's behest, to quell some acute or chronic pain they were suffering from. However, all of them, barring one [4 in total], eventually turned to black market heroin.\n\nAs you well know, there has been a sharp increase in the demand for black market heroin and the streets are now becoming littered with cheap and dangerous versions of this drug. \n\nAs we continue to see legalization of the harmless drug cannabis, cartels are turning to alternative sources of income, one of which is the growing and processing of poppies. \nThese scourges of the earth, you so diligently fight against daily, are becoming wealthy on the misery of others and there is something you can do to dip into their fiendish funds. Discontinue the rescheduling of another harmless plant so many turn to, to cheaply, safely, and effectively help remove their desire to continue to fund real terrorism. \n\nKratom users are doing society a service by using this legal alternative option and are spending their hard earned dollars elsewhere. Kratom users are directly freeing up your, and local PD's, resources to help clean up the streets of other dangers drugs. You should not punish those who are attempting help you in your endeavors. On the contrary, you should release a statement thanking those folks for making the safe and legal decision to help you in your fight.\n\nI urge you to seriously consider all the benefits that will come from keeping this safe and effective plant legal and to reconsider all the dangers that will befall society if the wrong choice is made.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22121","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nathaniel Wyngethrin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am asking you do not ban or schedule kratom, the herbal supplement.

I am a real estate professional with a very successful small business that I started this year after kratom helped in healing me.  I wish I didn't have to use the \"Anonymous\" comment, but I prefer to keep my identification confidential.  I am absolutely 100% opposed to the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances.  Kratom has been a life saver to me and making kratom illegal for me to purchase and consume would have a terribly negative effect on me and my family.  Here's a summary of my story:  I was addicted to alcohol and opiates for many years and just could not get sober.  My alcohol and opitate addiction was fueled by chronic pain resulting from a long, competitive career in a very physical sport. I have had some surgeries on my back and suffer from chronic back pain. I found kratom a little over a year ago when I was trying to get sober and now I have been sober for over a year now (14 months).  My last drink of alcohol was >14 months ago, and I have not taken any other prescription meds or even marijuana, which is legal here.  The only 2 \"drugs\" I consume now are coffee and kratom, with the occasional dose of ibuprofren for inflammation.  Kratom has drastically improved my life.  Before I got sober with the help of kratom, my life was a mess.  I had a newborn baby and a failed business.  In the >14 months I've been sober and only using kratom and coffee my life has done a 180.  I consider myself a very good father , friend, and family member now and I have an incredibly successful real estate business.  And my chronic pain is under control.  I'm even playing no-contact sports again!  I will be skiing again this season if kratom is still available to me.  Without kratom, I would probably have to stay off the slopes :(    Kratom has given me my life back and my family has the real me back as well.  Truth is, I was headed towards an early grave with my alcohol and opiate abuse before getting sober with the help of kratom.   Please I beg of you please do not take this incredible life saving herbal remedy away from us.  Regulation, yes that is understandable.  I absolutely do not want kratom readily available to kids.  I would not want kratom to be adulterated.  And I do not like the labeling on many kratom products.  \nI know there have been some ER visits from kratom.  I was curious to know how these statistics compare to the number of ER visits from caffeine overdoses and I came across this New York Times article: \nwww.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/business/more-emergency-room-visits-linked-to-energy-drinks-report-says.html   \nThis article says there were 20,783 ER visits from caffeine overdoses in 2011 alone.  Some caffeine energy drinks are marketing \"getting high or getting jacked\" on caffeine.  I have also seen some kratom labeled poorly and obviously targeting young people looking to \"get high\".   I think coffee and kratom are valid comparisons, they both don't make you feel very good if you take too much, and they also come from same plant family from what I understand?  These are the only 2 substances I use now that I am sober, and I do in fact consider myself a sober person with my use of only coffee and kratom.\n\nThank you so very much for your time and consideration of my comments.  I was devastated in early September when I heard about the 9/30 planned scheduling of kratom. And I was angry.  Then you announced that the 9/30 planned schedule was being cancelled and I was incredibly relieved.  It showed me the DEA cared.  That you heard and listened to kratom users who have had so much suffering relieved with this natural herb.  THANK YOU for that.  I will now anxiously await your decision after this comment period.  I hope and pray that I will still be able to legally consume kratom.  My life has changed immeasurably since I got sober 14 months ago, and I can't wait to see what the next years of sobriety bring me and my loved ones. I only consume kratom and coffee, nothing else.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nSober and grateful Kratom user","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16425","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"re: \tURGENT -- DO NOT BAN THE SALE AND USE OF KRATOM\n\nThe DEA is insistent on banning the purchase and use of kratom.  Apparently they feel as if Americans are in immenent danger and that kratom is an opioid-like substance. Now, you're likely wondering \"What's kratom?\"  It wouldn't surprise me -- very few people are aware that kratom even exists. \n\nIt is a gentle herbal supplement used primarily by older individuals to provide safe, non narcotic pain relief from arthritis and other aches and pains. I personally use kratom due to arthritis pain in my hand. I use kratom ONLY for flare ups and stop using it as soon as the pain subsides. I have never experienced withdrawal symptoms with discontinued use. \n\nThere are many users who obtain relief from opiate withdrawal.  Since I've never been an addict, I can't describe its benefits for withdrawal. What I can  attest to is that kratom is NOT an addictive drug, it is not a synthetic party drug, it is not popular with millennials -- many of whom have never heard of it. The demographic of a typical kratom user  is 45-65 years old, suburban, middle class, employed. Generally all law abiding people. \n\nKratom is not used merely to obtain a \"high\".  On the contrary, users quickly develop a tolerance to the \"euphoric\" side effect. Any attempt to misuse kratom to obtain a \"high\"  will result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and jitters but it will NOT result in respiratory arrest.\n\nAnother serious matter would be shutting down an entire industry. This ban would likely put tens of thousands of people out of work.  You must seriously consider the domino  effect as well.  The loss of this industry will cause irreperable harm to the economy. \n\nYet another fact to consider is that President Obama worked very hard to overturn prison sentences of nearly 400 non-violent offenders. Adding a law against the sale and use of kratom will refill the prisons and overcrowd them with thousands of peaceful, law abiding people to become felons.\n\nI've never even been arrested in my 57 years of life. I won't break the law, so now I'd have to begin the use of prescription narcotics. My doctor has offered to prescribe percocet, 10mgs, 3 times a day. I truly don't want to go there. I don't want to become an addict at this point in my life.\n\nThere is a group of senators (bipartisan) who are starting a \"Dear Colleague\" letter opposing the ban. I sincerely appreciate their concern in this matter and their effort to at least research kratom before banning it.\n\nI'm sure you know that as soon as the media runs the story about the pending ban, EVERYONE will want to try it--it'll be that \"wanting what they don't want you to have\" category. \n\nPlease consider the importance of keeping this mild herbal supplement legal for sale and use. I know you will do the best you can. \n\nSincerely appreciated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5591","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Burns","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\nI found Kratom almost a year ago when my back went out for no apparent reason.

No addiction or tolerance. \n\n2) It does not produce any strong effects. Even the most potent extract is still mild in nature and is completely natural. It is very similar to vitamins readily available (5-htp) but it is all natural.\n\n3) It can be taken as a supplememt to DAILY living with 100% positive or neutral effects. \n\n4) Just this once can you not ban a naturally growing plant from the use of the average human? Especially a plant that HELPS those who know about it? \n\nIn closing I'd ask that you take the plant in any quantity and see how it affects your life. It grows in different regions and each reason tends to produce very different, mild effects.

It is more than just a \"substitution\" for those wanting to rid themselves from a life of opiates or worse. Its not just another pain reliever, though it can help so many Americans who are living with chronic pain. It is a natural alternative to so many who chose to have control over their own lives. It is a way to be aware and conscious and in control over what we choose to put in our bodies. Natural and safe alternatives should never be banned. There are to many medications out there with a long list of black box warnings. Kratom has been shown to have a very low rate of adverse effects compared to the cycle of medications Drs throw around at patients, many of which in themselves are only a trial and error solution by Drs. Kratom is way less harmful to the people's health than many medications. Many medications do not have the long term effects even known yet, Kratom has been used for centuries. As I watch TV and see all the commercials for lawsuits of medication once prescribed heavily, the truths are now being shown that many had far greater risks. So its no wonder people are turning to more natural forms of retaining their own health. Kratom has had some bad forms out there it has been mixed or sold in ways not in the best interests of the many Kratom consumers out there. Listen to what is heard, we are fighting for just the plain leaf, nothing fancy, no different than many herbal teas.\nMy own health problems include Ankylosing Spondylitis, An chronic inflammatory arthritis, it has no cure. It is a daily battle of pain and fatigue that no amount of medication from Drs is relieving, I choose NOT to go the rout of many that includes taking pain pills. For many years I chose to go the alternate route taking only Tramadol. But that to now is turning out to more of a dangerous drug than the people were lead to believe. So I went on a search of natural alternatives many of which is botanical in nature in a way to not strictly to \"treat or relieve\" symptoms of my disease, but just to create a functional quality of life where I can continue to be productive member of society for as long as my body will let me. I don't feel wanting to do the right things for my body should ever be considered a felony. Kratom is one tool I greatly want to keep in my arsenal of alternatives to (chemicals) pills. Drs promote diet changes first and this is a very heathy way to accomplish that over taking medications.\nI use Kratom, I would recommend my friends and my family to use Kratom, It is a viable option in anyone's health and well being. I have helped friends who have been in the opiate mill conundrum. Given pain meds to live life with chronic pain, then without warning have everything just cut off. No assistance offered for weening down, adding to the deaths by opiates alone are those cut off and living disastrous bodily effects when they are left with zero help. Kratom has helped them to smoothly transition through the dangerous withdrawl effects at the hands of.... Well you fill in the blank here for me.\nKratom can be as individualized as are people. No one medication fits all, neither does Kratom. Call me a \"tree hugger\" I choose live a more natural life choosing plants over pills to find my comfort. Choosing to live with things found in nature in pure forms, not processed - pre packaged additives. I don't want to live to be 200 preserved by my foods I eat, I want to live feeling good NOW. More  people in this day and age where chemicals are becoming the norm in every day food and even the drinking water. Now that Kratom is known to be consumed by the user let us now label it accordingly and give sellers the chance to actually educate on usage and finding known contradictions.. I support some regulation to ensure we get pure natural leaf Kratom available to us and ensure the product is safe, and in the hands of responsible consumers. Kids will play, Sniffing glue, gas and paint, and mixing over the counter medicines, yet that is still available. Take a cue from that for marketing of Kratom. \nKratom If it were so dangerous to people it would not now be as popular as it is, as more and more people learn and understand the benefits of this plant. Like anything we put in our bodies, we as the consumer must do our own research and always it is \"do the benefits outweigh the risks\" and with Kratom this is proving to be way more on the side of benefits, than any risk involved. Deaths are so low with the use of Kratom. There is no \"high\" associated with it. Kids are NOT using this as a new recreational drug. Because there is no benefits like that. Common sense is the only thing lacking by people getting such adverse effects with Kratom. Something you can see is not lacking in the Kratom community of users. Kratom is not an iminate danger to the public. Please allow us our plant and our choice to use it.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4086","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dawn Marie T.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not personally use Kratom.

I find that it is not highly addictive; Kratom is certainly not as addictive as the drugs that doctors will prescribe one for pain. It's safe and therapeutic. \n\nKratom is also a great alternative to drinking alcohol in a social setting. Alcohol is dangerously intoxicating. Kratom does provide a \"buzz\" to the user but it does not detriment one's ability to drive or function. Also, Kratom does not cause hangovers. \n\nIn summary, I recommend reconsideration of the proposed regulation of Kratom. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nBenjamin Jones\n144-B Weybridge Circle\nRoyal Palm Beach, FL 33411","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4590","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Benjamin Jones","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't understand why the DEA is trying to ban a natural plant THAT HAS HELPED so many people with thier chronic pain or addictions, myself included.

I am responsible enough to hold myself accountable and I am aware to consume this leaf in moderation. What is completely backwards to me, alcohol fits the \"schedule 1\" classification to a \"T\"  but yet, its possible to buy and consume alcohol anywhere. More people die daily from alcohol than yearly from kratom. The problem lies within the companies and businesses that are synthesizing kratom. Kratom in its whole, natural state is safe and helps combat, not cure, different ailments. Kratom is NOT a cure for anything. Kratom is an aide. This battle with scheduling kratom is a battle that is being fought and won by multibillion dollar companies like Big Pharma. I cannot understand the logic behind wanting to ban kratom. The numbers do not add up and even the FDLE does not find any risk while consuming kratom. So there have been 660 poison control calls referring to kratom between 2014-2016. seems like a lot, right? Lets put that number into perspective. The first 7 months alone of 2016 there were 6,500 poison control calls in which Tide Pods were causing a hazard.\nIn South Florida, kratom has had a slow steady climb in sales. Over the past decade kratom has not caused any problems. About 4 years ago, a woman chose to blame her sons suicide on kratom. Meanwhile  the man had 4 pharmaceuticals in his system that had side effects of suicidal tendencies.\nLook, I am here trying to give you all these facts about why kratom should not be banned. You have already made up your mind. This public comment period was just to appease the consumers, to make it look like there was actually a care given. The only thing I can really say, please do no schedule kratom. Kratom improves my quality of life. I cannot go back to the way things were 4 years ago and thats what terrifies me. Kratom for me is not a cure, its an aide. It assists me in my daily routine just like coffee would. You wake up and drink your coffee, and I wake up and consume my kratom. Why do I choose to consume kratom? Well that's easy. I choose kratom for energy. I choose kratom because it uplifts my mood. I choose kratom because its a clean energy and I dont crash when it wears off. Now, tell me why you choose coffee? For energy, for your mood.. I bet you tell people not to even talk to you before you have finished at least one cup of coffee. I know I'm right, because I used to be the same way.\nMy point is, there is so much that still needs to be learned about this leaf. If kratom becomes a schedule 1, all research that is being done will come to a screeching halt. there were 150k people that signed the petition to keep kratom legal. Financially and economically, all those people that are purchasing kratom are paying taxes and are hard working americans. Our country is now at the point where we are legalizing marijuana nationally! This should have been done decades ago. Why are we going to take 2 steps forward and then 3 steps back? This war on drugs is not working. It never has and it has only made things much worse. I do believe it was Abraham Lincoln that said prohibition does not work. Im not against regulation! 18 years and older is not a bad idea. How could you live with yourself banning this leaf that helps so many people, but yet keep alcohol and tobacco legal and able to be purchased anywhere. Please reconsider. There has to be some kind of compromise that you and we could come to where we feel that we the people matter.. because Big Pharma creates customers not cures. Let us make the decision to choose natural over pharmaceutical.

My family, friends, and finances. Kratom was an important tool in my abstinence. It allowed me to resume my life, build a stronger foundation away from dangerous drugs. I was no longer shopping on the black market, nor engaged in criminal activity. This gave me more pause before I would commit any form of crime. I never robbed anyone, only myself. But I was certainly not an upstanding citizen due to violation of the law by using prescription drugs. When a person is already considered a felon for doing a drug, it is easier to justify committing other crimes. People begin to see themselves as criminals, because that is what their government tells them they are.\n\nMany others may have used Kratom to help stop that awful cycle of abuse and get back to a regular life. For many it has functioned as a stepping stone to ease the powerful pull of withdrawal. People do not steal from family because they want to, they begin to feel a physical need to, in order to stop the severe mental and physical pain of withdrawal. Kratom has never caused me any adverse effect, but it's awful tasting and it only works up to a point. Kratom is a mild substance.\n\nThe DEA should consider the ramifications of abruptly making tens of thousands of people who use kratom become criminals. It is undeniable that some of them will turn to the black market. As a self-employed taxpayer who has risen up out of a miserable life, I'd like to see federal resources expended toward stopping the flow of heroin and other drugs into our country. It would also be absurd for a person in possession of kratom to be incarcerated and turned into a felon, who cannot get a job, and become one more ex-con on the streets.\n\nI would not mind to see the FDA use its authority to ensure the authenticity of kratom in some fashion, but it is not a plant that needs heavy regulation. If anything, the drug the DEA proposed to ban along with kratom (U-4770 I believe), that is dangerous, as people may put that substance into any number of drug concoctions, or put it into kratom making it unsafe. Ban the things that are truly deadly and do pose public health crises. \n\nThank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20673","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl Ratcliff","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me with mild amounts of physical pain in my jaw caused by my teeth crowding.

Trigeminal Neuralgia and lupus are both incurable progressive diseases.  When I discovered kratom it made a huge impact on my life as well as my whole family.

I don't know if you've ever tried Kratom but if you have I hope you have had only positive experiences with it. I, myself, have had many positive experiences with the plant and, in fact, have had some not so pleasant experiences. Mostly, I want to focus on the benefits of Kratom treatment but I do not want to undermine those concerns that there may be about this plant. I use the plant to treat my panic attacks and sometimes when work is just too crippling to do, Ill treat myself to a healthy dose (~7 grams or so) of some good ol fashion nature and cruise through the day. I know this may seem strange or scary to some people but it makes a lot of sense. As a plant in the coffee family, it contains its own psychoactive ingredients that can influence your heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure while also altering the mood. The difference under question is how and at what cost?\nPersonally, I have done a lot of research about the effects of Kratom and from what I can gather, virtually none of accompanying risks of conventional opiate use, or alcohol use, or benzodiazepine use are present with Kratom. The one (maybe) potentially concerning side effect is the fact that it is a blood thinner. Therefore, those with low blood pressure probably shouldnt be using this plant as they may faint. Besides that, there other minor concerns that also come with many different medications such as itching, upset stomach, drowsiness, but nothing life threatening that I have found. I have heard of the potential for addiction but I will address those concerns in the following paragraph because that needs special attention.\nThe way in which American society treats addiction is so terrible because we have demonized certain drug users and praised others. We dont view addictions to substances such as coffee, or even alcohol to some extent, because they are a normalized part of our culture. In this manner, it has become so commonplace to require a cup of Joe or to in order to survive the day and a couple drinks at night to relax and unwind from a hard day. Were we to see a marijuana user or Kratom user taking their substance throughout the day, the average person may think lesser of the user because these substances have not been normalized yet by our society. Having experienced and seen the experiences of those who have abruptly terminated coffee, marijuana, and kratom usage (not all at the same time, that would be unbearable), by far the worst effects were experienced from coffee withdrawal. Mind you, the psychological effects are quite similar and include the inability to focus, lethargy, irritability, depression, and many more. However, coffee withdrawal also comes with physical side effects such as headaches, muscle pain, nausea, and other flu-like symptoms.\nI for one do not care so much to think about the negative side effects, as these are typical of overuse of any substance. Instead, I choose to focus on the benefits and why some people may use a plant such as Kratom. Many people, including myself, like the idea of natural medicines because nature has fine-tuned the production of such wonderful compounds that can be used to treat various ailments. Kratom contains compounds that can be used to cure insomnia, depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, overactive appetite, relieve pain, improve the immune system, block withdrawal symptoms of addiction to opiates, as well as prevent diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. The schedule 1 classification of this plant would essentially discredit any of these properties and instead demonize the plant and its users. Furthermore, it will cause major issues associated with its distribution.\nRight now, farmers simply sell Kratom as their crop and vendors distribute it across the country and the world. Making this illegal would cause tension between buyers and distributers that could potentially become violent, as has happened with other illegal substances. I see no reason why this plant cannot be simply regulated in a manner that does not allow for this potential. Making it illegal is only going to cause an underground market, which is going to take many lives. Furthermore, this plant will probably also be laced with who knows what type of opiates, rather than being exactly what we want it to be, which is pure unadulterated Kratom. If you really do not see the potential destruction that will be associated with the Kratom ban, please take a second look at the history of prohibition, specifically marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. Since their prohibition, usage has risen significantly, as well as the risk potential due to the fact that they are unregulated. If you dont want to see the type of violence and destruction that you see from the drug trade associated with Kratom, please keep it legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12308","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Noah Alsamadisi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been taking kratom for about a week now and have noticed my \"why get out of bed, there's nothing worth doing attitude \" is lifting, being replaced by me putting one foot in front of the other to do my chores and feeling good about it when they are done, it's been a loooong time since that happened ,thank you for your consideration in this matter","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16555","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rebecca Evans","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, My name is Carrie. I have a wonderful family, a masters degree in Psychology, and an addiction to opiate painkillers that nearly took my life. It also took my friends, my savings, my self respect, and a wonderful job at a prestigious university. After trying counseling and suboxin therapy, I pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I would never be able to stop killing myself with these pills. \nThen one day about 6 months ago I read about kratom on the Internet. I was skeptical, but I tried it anyway. Not only did it completely relieve my physical withdrawal symptoms, but it also relieved my psychological cravings for these deadly narcotics. Kratom dramatically changed my life, and I only wish that I found out about it sooner. The terrible side effects of suboxin, made me unable to take it. Kratom doesn't make my mind feel cloudy, or you're  body weak. It takes away the pain of withdrawals and leaves you with the feeling that you've just had an expresso. I have hope for the first time in years; but I am terrified that if kratom is outlawed, my pain and the cravings that come with it will return. I cannot go back to a harsh chemical treatment plan or to street drugs, I need a safe alternative that doesn't alter my persecution the way opits and suboxin does. Please consider my life when you consider scheduling kratom. I feel like I have a new lease on life, it's not easy, but it's a dream compared to the torment I was living in","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19865","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carrie Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Sean Weikel, age 30 years, and an Army veteran who served as a infrintry sniper in Afghanistan with the 10th Mountain DIV.  I am on disability from the VA and in the process of trying to go back to school which has been more difficult than I initially anticipated. I am diagnosed with PTSD and am in the middle of getting diagnosed with chronic knee pain.  With my disabilities i have found it difficult in the past to better myself and get through the day without losing it.  Kratom has help me to deal with my pain  and to try to better myself with schooling so that I can one day get off disability and be a productive member of society. I have used it for under a year and I feel that my life has started to turn around and I'm on track to finish my first successful semester and have landed myself an unpaid internship in the profession I seek.  Kratom helps me to deal with people and to not be overwhelmed with pain. I can only speak for myself but I have never had any issues and I'm completely satisfied with the supplement.  I relied on alcohol alot when I got honorably discharged but have been able to curb my usage dramatically with the help of this supplement.  I am concerned about what will happen to my stability and the stability of others if this supplement is put on schedule 1.  I hope that more research can be done to confirm the results I have experienced because if it is just disregarded without understanding the consequences many people, including me, will be hurt by  that.  I have recieved a letter from my senator stating their has been 660 incidents with kratom in 5 years which I find minimal when compared with prescription drugs and alcohol.  I am stating my belief in keeping kratom legal.  I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hope that you consider my experience in your decision.

I am  69 years old. I retired this year after teaching for 35 years at a vocational technical high school. I served my country from 1967 until 1969 in the Quang Tri province of Vietnam as advisor for army intelligence. I have known about Kratom for some time but became personally acquainted the value of Mitragyna Speciosa when my youngest daughter became afflicted with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after a sexual assault in her early twenties. Our family also became afflicted as the symptoms became so debilitating that she was unable to continue living her life as she had done prior to the trauma. She was an active student and worked for charity including a year as an Americorp Volunteer. After the assault, she had symptoms that disabled her and made her bed ridden. Though she was severely disabled, she worked her hardest to pursue available treatments and none worked. She soon became helpless. The available psychiatric treatment for PTSD has failed young people like my daughter and veterans like myself. When she discovered Kratom she made a quick recovery and is now living her life again. We have our daughter back and should not have to worry about losing her again. I know there are many thousands of honest and good people just like her; consuming Kratom to cope and live with conditions of chronic pain.To schedule Kratom would be to abandon them, us and the families all over again.\n\nAs this natural remedy is being threatened - we are all making ourselves acquainted with the science and politics behind this proposed decision. It has not gone unnoticed by anyone that Kratom is more effective and affordable than prescription drugs. I do not want to believe I risked my life for the freedom of my country and it's economy for such a consequential and important decision to be made hastily or for the interests of organizations and not the people. My children and the countless veterans who know about Kratom should not be denied the relief they have found - most after losing many years to pain; physical and mental. Mitragyna Speciosa is not a danger to society. I am against the proposed scheduling of Kratom. Thank you for your time, William C.

I was taught my trade by my late father Harry f Wilson to whom I'm eternally grateful. I've inheirated degenerative disc disease from both my parents and have suffered great pain for over 20 yrs. Also I suffer from depression,anxiety, alcohol and drug addiction. I'm also a diabetic and have had a big toe fusion surgery  on my right foot. I've been treated for chronic back and foot pain leading to narcotic dependency I started drinking and using prescription drugs trying to find pain relief for my physical and emotional disabilities over 30 yrs ago. I worked with the same company for over 20 yrs doing construction and maintainence. I was fired in 2006 because I was unfit for duty because of my addiction. I  had turned into a full blown junkie. After unemployment I tried jobs in the same field with various employers being let go for being physically unable to perform the required duties. After being laid off in 2011 from a yr job I suffered a drug overdose resulting in a 9 day coma. My kidneys failed and I was hospitalized for a little over a month. I needed a kidney transplant and was put on dialysis as well as a list to receive a donated kidney. Getting ready for my twice a week dialysis appointment I received a call from the Dr saying tests showed that my kidneys had regained function. Thank God. I tried to get clean and sober, entered Aiken barnwell mental health hospital having outpatient treatment. I'm grateful to the staff at this caring and compassionate State treatment facility. I overdosed again on morphine and xanax resulting in another 3 day coma followed by yet another rehab hospital in Aiken SC. I'm very lucky to be alive. I was unable to work and had a disability hearing pending when I discovered the plant kratom. This was the end of 2014. At the time I was on 3 different antidepressants as well as taking narcotic pain meds again. K Seeking some kind of relief . For the first time in over 20 years I immediately felt that there might be hope for my addiction ,severe depression and suicidal thoughts. I had tried everything and truly believe I was at the end of my rope. I didn't think kratom would work but stayed with it and continued to improve. In a few short months I was off all of the antidepressants as well as pain meds. Went to work for a housing developer where 14 months later I remain a valuable employee. I've even received a pay raise and am off public assistance. Kratom has been the core reason for my improvements. I was working when my disability hearing was held so I told the judge that I enjoyed working and didn't want to go on permanent disability benefits. He denied the request for my receiving benefits and I remain working today. I buy kratom online in the form of pure ground leaf and use it for my general well being daily. I truly believe that I would be dead had I not discovered kratom. So, I beg of you, please do not place kratom on the scheduled drug list. I honestly don't know what I would do about my pain. I've had no side effects at all and my blood sugar levels are great. My pain is still here but somehow I am able to tolerate it. I have no desire to use drugs or alcohol anymore. Thank you so much for your time and the work you do. Please consider my comments and thank you again. Sincerely Wesley f Wilson sr.

Neither if us drink alcoholic beverages, so we wanted to try some new natural drinks. At the bar, we were educated, by the staff on Kava and Kratom. We each tried both drinks, each fixed as a tea, and found that they both were very good and we didn't feel intoxicated at all. I felt very calm and relaxed as did my wife. We have enjoyed visiting the Kava bar on numerous occasions since that first time.\nNever have we ever felt impaired from either of these drinks.\nI believe that the urgency of you ban on Kratom is very misplaced. In my opinion, there should be a HUGE urgency to ban MANY of the legal (and FDA approved) prescription medications/drugs that are posing the real danger to to the public.\n It would be a terrible disaster to turn so many hundreds of thousands of otherwise law abiding, voting, tax paying citizens into criminals just because we enjoy a cup of kava ot a glass of Kratom tea.\nI'd like to add that I am an 86 year old retired dental equipment service technician who has NEVER been in trouble with police for any reason.

Kratom helps people, but even if it was doing harm, which it is not, scheduling would only result in more incarcerations and opiate overdose deaths. \n\nWe have an opportunity to put an end to the opioid epidemic that is affecting the lives of millions of Americans and Kratom is helping to do just that NOW. Yes right NOW, and yes, more research is needed, but in the meantime this plant is saving lives as we speak. Prohibition would be contrary to both of these things. I cannot stress this enough, Kratom is helping people right now. The very thing that we are discussing banning is saving peoples lives. \n\nBeyond all of this, Kratom is helping people in other ways. People suffering from chronic pain, depression, PTSD, anxiety, alcoholism, etc., are finding relief with the use of this natural plant. Prohibition would, at best, limit their options to a choice between otherwise dangerous pharmaceuticals that they have found to be less effective, have worse side effects and are also addictive, or, a life of prolonged suffering, and at worst, turn them into criminals for seeking the safe, natural relief that they deserve as human beings.\n\nI ask that you please consider my thoughts on this matter while making your decision.\n\nSincerely, \n A.G.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7317","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-26T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Conern,\n\nI've just learned about Kratom and the possibility of it being banned and listed as a schedule 1 drug.

The best way to treat someone who has a problem is to allow them to be open about their problem/seek help, and to provide them with ways to combat their addiction, not to label them a criminal, resulting in even more frustration and isolation from the drug user. Science and psychology has essentially proven that the main cause of drug addiction is lack of personal connection in their life. By labeling them a criminal, it only results in making them more of an outcast and less likely to seek help. So with this in mind, I am against the classification of this drug as schedule 1, because it will only result in labeling them a criminal. The only support I would have for classification of drugs would be to take the criminal offenses away from the drugs, so people are able and more willing to seek help without repercussions, but still know the dangers of the drugs due to their classification.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3981","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gene Weatherly","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is incumbent upon you to listen to the people that need this for their health and make that a precedent over any garbage you have heard or any preconceived notions you have about Kratom.

I can't understand why my government would protect me from such a benign plant, when it is terrorists, etc of whom I'd like to be protected. \n\nI have no problem with kratom being treated as alcohol (18+), but I feel that way about alcohol and ANY herb. There are herbs out there much more psychoactive than kratom that are legal, but I have no interest.  Been there done that 40 years ago.\n\nI just want my pain going and not ruin my heart with prescription drugs (what is left of it) and kratom offered that luxury at a very low price. \n\nI took not a gram more after 4 years of taking it on and off than I did the first day. I was happy and our marriage was working well.  I went from bedridden to occasionally mountain hiking with my wife.  I can think straight.  I'm a published writer again (hadn't written in years due to the arthritis) etc.  \n\nPlease allow us (responsible kratom users) safe access to it.  Anyone who is using it as a \"party drug\" is going to be highly disappointed. It offers no such \"feeling\" as wanting to party.  Like Ginko Biloba, St. John's Wort, etc., it offers me focus and a good concentration while, for about 3-5 hours absolutely no pain where I usually have it most. \n\nThank you for your consideration.\n\nRichard \n\nPS My beloved wife, age 59 gets terrible regular menopause hot flashes.  She tried kratom as a long shot; she'd tried everything else, and it worked 100%; nothing else even came close.  This kind of thing is so important for our lives and marriage. Please don't punish us for our pain. We didn't want it, and we don't want to take chemical drugs for it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1501","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Stetelman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Audrey Steel, 22, Office manager for Electric Company \nIt is very concerning that Kratom is being looked at as a substance that needs to be \"controlled\".\nKratom has been nothing but a blessing in my life. \nI started using Kratom after I had a baby and was formula feeding, I was very tired and overall just needed something to pick me up in the day.

I'm a devoted wife and mother. Due to issues with my spine I've been in considerable pain and, at times, bedridden because of it.  I was prescribed painkillers and was taking the same dosage for five years. I did not want them yet they were, regrettably, my only option. They made me ill. I stopped taking them but the pain was unbearable. Then I discovered, by chance, Kratom. This natural supplement has allowed me to once again be a productive member of my family and community. I take a small amount of this plant- a teaspoon- three times a day and I can say I've been mostly pain free for the last three months. There is occasional neuropathic pain, but it is far less than what I experienced while taking opioid pain meds. I also have asthma, and this plant does not expose me to the risk of respiratory distress that is present with prescription pain medication.  I humbly urge and implore you to not ban Kratom. \n\n\nRespectfully Yours, \n\nStephanie","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8224","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me get off of opiates.

I am a 38 year old Father, Husband, Engineering Supervisor, and responsible adult Kratom consumer.  I strongly oppose any scheduling of the tea leaf Mitragyna Speciosa.  However, I am not opposed to making the tea leaf only available for people over twenty-one.  I have severe back pain as well as issues with depression.  These problems caused me to be out of work for a good part of my adult life.  I tried many prescriptions for both of these issues.  Pharmaceuticals not only did not help me, but made my brain very foggy.  The worse I became, the more chemical medicines the doctor put me on.  It got so bad that I just stayed at home and collected welfare, becoming a menace to society, the economy, and myself.  One day I woke up and decided that I had enough of this life and that I needed to find a way to get better since the medicines prescribed were only making me worse.   I looked online and found Kratom.  I was skeptical at first, as I did not think something natural could help me.  When I received the Kratom, I made a tea and gave it a try.  It helped me feel better.  It did not cure my pain or depression, but it helped me enough that I could start working on myself and my life.  I have been taking Kratom for eight years now.  I am now married with two children that I take great care of, and I have a wonderful job making more money than I ever thought I could.  I have also completed many college courses since I added Kratom to my supplement regimen.  Kratom does not make me high, lower my inhibitions, or leave my brain foggy as things such as pharmaceuticals and alcohol do.  I have had blood work done and many doctor checkups since I started taking Kratom, and I am the healthiest and happiest I have ever been.  I feel it is our God Given right to use what was given to us on this Earth to help better our health and life.  I strongly believe that is the way it is meant to be, and I do not understand requiring someone to go to the doctor to receive a prescription for a plant.  Also, with the health care system in the state that it is in, who can afford to go to the doctor, or get a bunch of prescriptions, plant or otherwise? I definitely do not want to have to take the chemical versions of Kratom, that I feel certain are pending release.  If pharmaceutical companies want to make a chemical version of Kratom that is their right, but I should still be allowed to take the safe pure leaf.    If Kratom was dangerous or made you high, how did my life and so many others get so much better thanks to hard work and this tea leaf? I know what is beneficial for my life and my body, and Kratom has been a great addition to my daily supplement regimen.  It has helped me to feel good enough to start working on my life, mind and body.  My life has gotten so much better in the last eight years.  Please do not schedule this tea leaf, or make it difficult for people to acquire.   Kratom consumers have been safely taking this leaf for many years and still living a healthy productive life.  It has been safely taken for at least centuries in other countries, and at least twenty years in the United States.  If it was dangerous it would have caused problems in this country many years ago.   Instead, Kratom consumers are regular people that vote, work, and contribute to our economy and society as a whole.  We should be able to decide what supplements to take to better our life as long as we are not hurting anyone or becoming a burden on society.  I fear making Kratom scheduled would do the opposite of the intended effect.  It would hurt many people and families, as well as the economy and society as a whole, by taking working people out of work and leaving people with less safe options for their own health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16459","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Steven Nolfi.

I went to a doctor, i didnt know at the time, that was a \"pill doctor\" I had never done drugs before this. For 3 months he through pills at the pain until I read online to ask for an MRI. I did and a rupture in my L5-S1 was found. I had surgery and after surgery felt great, but I had sever withdrawl. I went back to that doctor and asked for more pain killers and did so for a year until my life was falling apart. I was married and had 2 kids. My pill addictiom created many problems in my relationship. I went to rehab, but the damage was done. I continued to have marriage difficulties and ended up relapsing then finally separating and going down a very dark period in my life.\n\nLuckily I went to prison. I was in prison for 2 years and was released March 2015. I lost righys to both my sons and my father adopted my oldest. I had ambitions of getting to be in both my sons lives. I spoke with a friend I used to use with and ge explained he was clean and living a good life. He explained kratom. Shortly after I tried kratom hoping it would help with ongoing back pain. I have Degenerative disc disease, as well. It did help to my amazement. I ruptured anothee disc summer of 2015 and refused to go on any pain killers. Kratom helps without all the negative effects of narcotic pain killers. I now have full custody of my oldest boy, an amazing fiance, a house, and last but far from least a beautiful 2 month old baby girl. Not bad from getting out of prison a year ago with a garbage bag of clothes.\n\nI understand pharmaceutical companies wanting to create drugs with active alkoloids.

Sometimes I take Kratom to relax after a hard day of work . But I know any time you have something beneficial there will be others who want to abuse and take a crazy amount just to see if they can get some kind of a high from it . But what about the millions out there that it helps who do not abuse it ?

If we tell teenagers that Kratom is just as dangerous as Heroin, teenagers who try Kratom may conclude that Heroin is not dangerous.\n\nKratom has transformed my life. My mother was a Heroin addict, and when I was very young, she shared Heroin with me. I was just a child, I had no idea that what I was doing was wrong, dangerous, or illegal. I was young and I trusted my Mother. I wasn't able to function in everyday society. Once I was older, I couldn't maintain a relationship, romantic or otherwise, I couldn't hold a job, and I hated myself. I didn't understand that Heroin was taking those things away from me, because I was sheltered and coerced by a figure I thought I could trust.  \n\nOnce I was old enough to leave that toxic environment, I discovered Kratom. In just a few months time, I was sober. I did not experience any difficulty in \"quitting\" Kratom. I am now completely clean and sober, and I would be remiss if other people sharing a story similar to mine never got the opportunity to be saved. Even if Kratom were scheduled and prescribed to addicts, it would become too expensive for an addict to afford, not to mention poor people suffering chronic pain. For Kratom to undergo a transformation like that would literally be sending thousands of people to their graves. It's a substance that is self regulating, the potential for abuse is not strong enough - it's just not \"fun\". The only people using it are people who need to manage their pain, it's not the type of thing someone can abuse for a \"good time\". In fact, it's a rather uncomfortable experience; it's the opposite from what an addict is looking for. \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12118","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"S D","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 32 year old white male that is disabled because I have Asperger's Syndrome.

I would get clean for several months & then something would trigger me & I would start back using again. \n\nOne day I found something called Kratom online & I tried it & it was like a Miracle Herb. It made me feel \"Normal & Happy & Not Doped Up Or High\" like Opiates or Benzos. From then on I would never take another drug again.

Kratom has so many Positive Attributes. \n\nI have had Mild Autism, Anxiety Disorders, Migraine Headaches, Agoraphobia, Severe Depression all my life. Nothing has helped me like Kratom has helped. Kratom has so many uses & you cannot overdose on it. The absolute worse side effect is dizziness, nausea, constipation or a mild headache & that all can be remedied with taking less Kratom. If you take too much your body will immediately get rid of it by vomiting it out\n\nKratom is such a Complex Herb. I don't know if it's possible to learn everything there is to learn about it.

I have been married for close to 10 years and have 2 step kids (20 and 22 years old) and one biological son (5 years old). I am a student at KU working towards a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, and reside in Lees Summit, MO where my husband and I just purchased our first house. \n\nAbout  4 years ago, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a disorder that causes widespread chronic pain and shares similar symptoms as MS. Lupus, as well as many other autoimmune disorders.  I have been on many medications including opiate pain killers to help alleviate the pain. I spent a great deal of time feeling dopey, forgetful, drugged, and addicted to the opiate painkillers prescribed to me. I though there had to be more to life than this. So I started  doing some research on natural options.\n\nAbout a years ago, I discovered a supplement called \"Kratom\" and it changed my life completely.  This all-natural supplement is in the same family as coffee and provides more pain relief than any opiate pain killer I have been prescribed. I didn't feel drugged, in fact, I had more energy than I've had in years. Not once have I experienced withdrawals or anything more than a little nausea due to taking the supplement on a empty stomach.  I feel the same way when I take vitamin B complex or my multi-vitamin on an empty stomach. \n\nOnce being bound to my bed or couch, I am now able to be more active, play with my 5 year old son, run errands, go to school, cook, clean, etc.  All things that people take for granted that I could finally do.  I also can work out again and am doing better in school.\n\nLosing this supplement would revert my life back to a miserable, couch-bound, and chronically ill, wife, mother, and student. It would devastate my life and relationships I have with my friends and family as well as the future that I am working so hard to achieve. I beg you to reconsider your stance on Kratom. It has helped so many people and would be a tragedy to those that depend on it to remain a functional member of society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6468","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Golato Bishop","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be come illegal.

This notice of intent to schedule the \"drug\" (which are actually just chemical constituents of nature's botanical, not some dangerous \"drug\") is entirely immature and unfounded. The fact that this alleged \"ban\" comes along at the same time that Big Pharma is patenting synthetic chemicals that resemble these active constituents, in order to treat pain and anxiety and depression just blatantly shows how the DEA is lobbying for Big Pharma's control over the Kratom industry.\n\nAs I'm sure you know by now, the Botanical Education Alliance and American Kratom Association are pulling for stricter indications and stronger focus on purity/safety. However, while this is nice and reassuring, people who take Kratom know what amount works for them, and the only ER visits have been from polydrug use, not \"Kratom intoxication\" - the latter would make one vomit the Kratom and render it rather useless, floating in the toilet. But it won't land you in the emergency room. There has been a humongous outpouring of caffeine related ER visits compared to anything regarding Kratom; not to mention, Kratom is no more habituating than coffee and shares it's extremely minor day-after tired feeling. This makes sense, and it tells us that, while Kratom is a member of the coffee family (fact check me), Kratom is probably safer than coffee. At least, if you're using substance-related ER visits as your measuring factor of harm.\n\nThe community behind this plant is not seeking recreation; they are trying to live functional lives in the face of pain, fighting through it in a docile manner (especially compared to these ridiculously, incomparably addictive opioids and opiates prescribed by Big Pharma.\n\nOf Kratom is put on schedule I and people lose access to it, you will proceed to see the worst opioid epidemic this country has ever seen. I've already read plenty of stories of people turning back into the zombified versions of theirselves on western medicine pain management therapy, and it has already ruined enough lives to take things this far. Let Kratom be, and trust that the Botanical Education Alliance will protect the Kratom using community from any hazardous sources/vendors of the powdered herb.\n\n\nBy the way, there are bigger flies to kill. Ever heard of fentanyl analogues, or U-47700? They are readily available and pure on black markets. I don't want to see people turning to dangerous opioid drugs or things like \"Lean/Sizzurp\" in place of something that was previously helping facilitate existence, rather than letting it wear away in front of you. We're already in the middle of a heroin epidemic. It will increase so rapidly after the potential scheduling of Kratom that it will be like a zombie apocalypse.\n\nKratom is a WELLNESS SUPPLEMENT that attenuates opioid withdrawal (without carrying the dangerous constipatory or respiratory depression side effects), eases depression for people who have no luck with western medicine, and obliterates unfounded anxiety from anxiety disorders. It is non-addictive (at least not more than coffee; Google \"Kratom and Forbes\" for a well-written subjective account of a writer trying to convey how docile Kratom actually is and respectively how demonized it is by this country and the DEA in particular.\n\nSave Kratom.

I live with chronic pain from illnesses that are considered terminal. I have not been able to work for the past few years because of my pain. I also had to take time off school since just walking to class is too painful for me. However, when I found Kratom over this past summer, my life changed. Within two weeks of taking it I was able to get a job. I do aftercare at a school and on Friday I was even playing dodgeball with my kids. From not being able to get out of bed 4 months ago, to playing dodgeball a few days ago, it is safe to say Kratom gave me my life back. The thought of Kratom becoming a schedule 1 drug is terrifying. How can a plant that you make into tea to help relieve pain or give you energy, be classified the same as something like heroin which has killed dozens of my friends. Kratom is in no way addictive. However, the caffeine found in coffee can be addictive but yet no one is trying to make coffee a schedule 1 drug. If the thought of that sounds crazy to you, that's how crazy the idea of Kratom being scheduled 1 sounds to me. My friend who has some similar health issues as me tried to get me to try Kratom for over a year. I kept blowing her off because in my head I thought how the hell can a plant help me when I need to take 200+ mgs of OxyContin and/or morphine daily. She finally got me to try it over the summer and I instantly regretted not trying it sooner. It makes me feel like a person again. I can work, go back to school, and just be normal. Not groggy all day from the pain meds, or in too much pain to get out of bed. My quality of life is at an all time high right now. If Kratom becomes illegal, I know I will spend how ever much time I may have left, in severe pain in bed. Kratom is allowing me to actually live. It doesn't change how sick I am, but it does give me reason to keep living until I can't anymore. Not spending the rest of my time in bed is my only wish.

I became much worse in my 20's and by the time I was 30 I was started on opioids to control my pain. I was finally properly diagnosed when I was 34 and fully bedridden to relieve strain on my heart and increase my lifespan . All that can be done is to treat symptoms, there is no cure, so for 8yrs I lay in bed on increasing amounts of medications including high doses of Norco Morphine and Soma. I lived in a fog. I slept my days away. \nI have been married for 22yrs and have 4 amazing children. My husband and kids did not have me in their life like they deserved for those 8yrs and I feel like that was precious wasted time. \nI am medically educated with licenses as an EMT, EMT-I, Paramedic, Operating Room Tech, and Diagnostic Medical Sonographer. I understand how important medications are to us but have learned that we need nature too. \nJust 2yrs ago as I realize quality of life for me is much more important than quantity, I searched the Internet desperate for help that doctors weren't able to provide. I found kratom and after much research decided I had nothing to lose by trying it. \nThe very first day using this herb I went half a day without needing (or even wanting) my opioids. I have a new energy similar to really good strong coffee but no jitters. I cannot handle coffee normally as my condition has caused heart failure and I cannot handle harsh stimulants. I was alert!! I was able to spend time out of bed and with my family. I now spend anywhere from 6-10hrs of my day out of bed (which is huge for me) and am able to do some small chores around the house but mainly it's time I have with my family.  I am able to spend this precious time with them now and only wish I had found this herb sooner. \nI am now on the very lowest doses of opioids and only taken on really bad health days despite the fact my health is rapidly deteriorating. I have no negative side affects from kratom and my body is highly sensitive to medications normally. We all deserve to be able to do what is best for our bodies and this is best for me and countless others. Please don't take this away. Utilize this plant to help people! Allow us our promised freedoms to use natural supplements and help people get healthier again. Allow me to spend my end of life with my family. This herb deserves further research and testing, closing that off will only hurt so many people and one day it may be you that is in need of it. We need MORE options to alleviate illness symptoms not less. We need to see these testimonials as a beacon of hope that nature can help some people and be open to that idea. We need to embrace what nature has provided and not make everything about big pharma and money!

Also, if kratom is added to any of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars, when there has been nothing to support that these people are creating problems in civil society. Furthermore, Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. Considering how many people struggling with opioid addiction as well as the number of people that have used kratom to help them cut back or quit suggest we should at least be considering the medical benefits Keaton might possess, but rescheduling will halt all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment.

Why?  Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it!  Quite the contrary.\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain.  Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nKratom works by using a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation and respiratory depression.  In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies (http://bit.ly/2c8UTI6).\n\nA leading researcher notes regarding Kratom that Thailand is considering legalizing it as a safer alternative for meth addicts.  U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects (http://bit.ly/2c8SI7v).\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk.  But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms.\n\nMeanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, more dangerous, and harder to kick.  Yet the FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban Kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.\n\nIs the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize Kratom?

Approximately three years ago, I was prescribed anti-depressants after being diagnosed with depression. My psychiatrist, at that time, prescribed me with a few different SSRI's and a dopamergenic. I know that for some people, anti-depressants may work, however they had an adverse affect on me and the side effects far outweighed the benefits. I found that the SSRI's made my depression worse. I tapered off the medication, which was difficult, even though I was only on them for a couple of months. At that time, I heard about Kratom and decided to give it a try. I consumed Kratom for approximately two months in the wake of my negative experience with prescription medications. Kratom did not cure or treat my depression, however it noticeably enhanced my quality of life. I still struggled with depression and I still had anxiety, however, Kratom helped promote a sense of well being that made it possible to get through those two months and still be a productive member of society. To further expound upon how Kratom has helped me, yet not treated any condition of mine, I would like to go into detail about just what my condition is. Recently, I discovered through a gene test that I have a genetic mutation of the MTHFR gene and this means that my body does convert folic acid into methylfolate which is the precursor to serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. I have been supplementing with a prescribed medical food, L-methylfolate, which has targeted that genetic anomaly and balanced it, therefore increasing my serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine levels safely and naturally without any adverse affects. Also, my serotonin transporter has a genetic mutation where the presynaptic transmembrane protein (SLC6A4) has an intermediate risk of being non-response. Essentially my serotonin levels can pool up, therefore generating large risk with any intake of a prescribed SSRI. This also means that my glutamate levels are higher than the average person, which can generate large amounts of anxiety and also create insomnia because your brain cannot turn off. I would like to reiterate and say that Kratom did not fix these gene mutations and increase my serotonin levels like L-methylfolate has, nor did it force my glutamate levels down like a prescribed medication would. However, in that transitory phase of my life, Kratom safely helped promote a healthy lifestyle and gave me the energy to continue working. It's a safe alternative to caffeine and I would like to compare and explain why Kratom is safer than caffeine. I consumed a lot of caffeine in my years prior to my experience with Kratom, and it damaged my health. Caffeine acts on the adrenal glands, which is the bodies primary defense against stress. With my genetic variations, stress and depression were amplified, and when my adrenal glands were exhausted, I had no physiological defense against that stress which contributed to developing GERD and other digestive imbalances. Kratom has proven to me to be safer than caffeine and has not had any negative impact on my body like caffeine has nor has it inhibited my bodies ability to fight stress. In fact, some of the many alkaloids found in the kratom plant, act as an immunostimulant, which has helped my body fight off infection. Granted, when it comes to fighting bacterial and viral infections, there is no replacement for proper diet and sleep. I implore the FDA to do rigorous testing of Kratom and allow for data to be put fourth from many reputable and independent sources in order to prevent bias. \n  I would like to pose a few questions to the regulatory agencies that have read this comment in addition to thanking them for taking the time to read my testimony. Firstly, I would like to ask the DEA as to why they chose to pursue a ruling over Kratom before the synthetic substance, U-47700. I am aware that they have stated their ruling to schedule Kratom was in the interest of public safety, and I believe public safety should be top priority. However, as reported by FoxNews in June of 2016, research chemical U-47700 was directly responsible for fifty plus deaths nationwide in a span of less than a year. This poses a much greater danger to public safety than any recorded threat of Kratom, however legal action was first initiated against the natural plant Kratom and not synthetic chemical U-47700. This leads me to my next question, will the DEA publicly release the footnotes that were the basis for their decision to schedule Kratom under the FOIA?\n In conclusion, Kratom has been legal for over two decades in the US and has never caught on as a recreational high. It does not incapacitate the brain like alcohol does and has a long history of safe use. Please keep Kratom legal.\n Thank you for your time in reading my public comment and considering my questions. May you all have Happy Holidays this year.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15587","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carl York","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am writing to you today about a great injustice which is about to befall our country. As of September 30th, the D.E.A is going to reschedule Mitragyna Speciosa, also known as Kratom, to schedule I. Just to refresh, the DEA definition for a schedule I is as follows:\nSchedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. (A DE. DEA / Drug Scheduling. DEA / Drug Scheduling. https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml. Accessed September 1, 2016.)\nWith the phrase, \"no currently accepted medical use,\" in mind, I would ask you to refer to the link to the article below from \"The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,\" which states explicitly:\n\"Evidence suggests that kratom is being used extensively for both medical and nonmedical purposes. Recent studies have shown that kratom contains a variety of active compounds that produce major pharmacologic effects at opioid and other receptors. Kratom and kratom derived drugs may potentially be used for management of pain, opioid withdrawal symptoms and other clinical problems.\" (Prozialeck, W. C., PhD, Jivan, J. K., BS, & Andurkar, S. V., Phd. (2012, December). Pharmacology of Kratom: An Emerging Botanical Agent With Stimulant, Analgesic and Opioid-Like Effects | The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. Retrieved September 01, 2016, from http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2094342)\nThe doctors from the above article, and the numerous journals they cited throughout their article agree that kratom is currently being used for the medical properties of the plant, and further study and research is needed, \"Further research on the therapeutic uses, toxic effects, and abuse potential of kratom and its constituent compounds are needed.\" (Prozialeck, W. C., PhD, Jivan, J. K., BS, & Andurkar, S. V., Phd. (2012, December). Pharmacology of Kratom: An Emerging Botanical Agent With Stimulant, Analgesic and Opioid-Like Effects | The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association. Retrieved September 01, 2016, from http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2094342)\nIf we allow the DEA to reschedule Kratom, Mitragyna Speciosa, we will be removing a potentially lifesaving medicine as well as criminalizing a wide swath of our country's population overnight for possession of their medicine.\nThere are numerous accounts across the internet from veterans, teachers, professors, normal everyday Americans which Kratom has helped ween off of opioid addiction and manage pain. Sure, these people could be lying because they want to get intoxicated, but to what end?\nKratom should be scheduled, that is a fact. If we truly want to foster innovation in this country and live up to the true \"American exceptionalism\" we have built ourselves up to, we should not establish the schedule of Kratom as any higher than Schedule II. At that level we can foster and federally fund research while reigning in the free-for-all market that currently exists. Once sufficient research from universities and pharmaceuticals has been completed the DEA can re-schedule kratom as it sees fit, but there is no reason to stifle research of any drug.\nAlso, bear in mind, states could behave in the same manner they did with Cannabis, rebuking the federal government and the DEA by legalizing the drug in their state. The federal government and the DEA find themselves in a very untenable position as the movement grows and more states legalize Cannabis. This piece-meal approach to legalization is dangerous with widely varying statutes and regulations at the state and even local level. Reasonably scheduling Kratom would eliminate the need for heavy handed action by the states' politicians to preserve and advocate for their constituency.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18965","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"robin fisher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nMy name is Victoria and I am a 31 year old, happily married mother to a 3 and 1 year old.

It has helped me tremendously with pain, PTSD, anxiety, depression and general well being, most days I would not be able to function very well without it. To me it is comparable to not having coffee, you feel tired, and lethargic. I have taken the same dose over the years, 1 cap in the am, and 2 in the pm, sometimes during the day if i am in extreme pain. When it wears off 6 or 7 hours later your just in pain again,unlike the horrible body aches and chills and vomiting you get from not taking oxycodone! I am shocked that this could be classified in the same category as heroin, I consider myself addiction free at this point, and can only pray with thousands of others that you do not ban this, what choice will we have then? go back on expensive prescription medications that are barely available anymore? buy drugs illegally? How many thousands have to die from prescription medications to make a change? Please reconsider your thoughts on kratom, for I believe It has saved hundreds of lives!

Kratom has personally helped me immensely in coping with anxiety, depression, and chronic physical pain. I have been using kratom supplements, and researching kratom for nearly 4 years for several of the beneficial effects. I do not believe there is much of a debate on whether kratom is safe. Even with little research concluded at this time, one can assure you that kratom is one of the absolute safest, pain-killing supplements there is today, even when comparing OTC painkillers, like Tylenol and Advil, which are both known to be extremely safe, yet have caused far more deaths than kratom. Kratom use has been recorded for thousands of years and has never been proven to be the standalone cause of a single recorded death. In the research that has been completed, kratom has shown to be a very safe, useful, non-addictive supplement that has several benefits, with very few drawbacks. Kratom is also one of the only supplements with pain-killing properties that does not cause respiratory depression, which is the leading cause of death in opiate overdoses. Scheduling this plant to any degree at this time would not only be irresponsible and unreasonable, but it would put research to a halt, forcing American citizens back on harmful prescription drugs that are known to be dangerous and addictive, with no resolution for the issue in sight. This supplement needs to remain completely legal, and available to all American adults, or else those in need will suffer, and if history has taught us anything, prohibition of kratom at any level will lead to unintended, adverse consequences, such as more addiction, incarcerations, organized crime, overdoses/suicides, etc.\n\nI have heard from many users who turned to kratom after being unable to function properly on pharmaceuticals due to their addictive properties. Kratom doesn't \"cripple\", or kill, its users. In this substantial opiate epidemic, there is a great chance that kratom can help those addicted to opiates, and as the people are claiming, it already has. Research shows that kratom does not create addicts; in fact, research shows that it cures them. This is a plant that is helping millions, being erroneously and negligently outlawed. I am afraid scheduling kratom will have contrary and unintended consequences. In states that banned kratom, Alabama specifically, opiate usage and deaths went up considerably after kratom was banned in the state. In Florida, the FDLE issued a report that said \"no pervasive health issues have been attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida\". North Carolina also recently decided not to ban kratom after hearing testimony from people who benefited from the supplement; instead of an outright ban, they made it legal for adults ages 18+, which would be much more beneficial to the cause and is known in recent history to have much less unintended, negative consequences.\n\nThe American people are overwhelmingly in favor of keeping kratom legal, as it is much less dangerous to consume over synthetic drugs on any regular basis. The American people should have the right to safely and freely use this plant as a substitute of the dangerous, addictive, harmful drugs that are still being legally over-prescribed by medical professionals, which are responsible for the deaths of nearly 19,000 Americans per year, as well as the additional 10,500 who die from heroin; many of whom became addicted to the drug while taking their legally prescribed pain medicine. It is no secret that the healthcare system in America is seriously flawed and is even influenced by major pharmaceutical companies for the sole purpose of creating wealth, often at the burden of the American people. Outlawing kratom would only amplify this issue, giving more power to the same corporations that are benefitting from the American people remaining addicted to harmful substances, and would even put responsible, moral, law-abiding Americans in prison, simply because this natural supplement helps users cope with their ailments. By scheduling kratom at any level, the American government would be forcing its citizens to choose between either consuming harmful, synthetic drugs, which they do not want to consume, and/or suffering; denying ones' basic individual liberty to live a happy, healthy life in America. Most users do not want to take kratom supplements, but rather choose the lesser of two evils when dealing with chronic pain, depression, addiction, anxiety, and even PTSD. Not everyone is blessed without ailments. Millions of Americans and I, including many injured US Army veterans, whom I've heard from, will suffer without kratom. It is unethical to forbid these users a supplement that they could not imagine living without. Kratom must be kept legal for all American adults for our country to progress, and not regress further into the opiate epidemic we are facing today.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7234","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Vienna and I am a 33 year old College Professor.  Please keep Kratom legal.  I oppose the  DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances. This would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. The DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.  I discovered Kratom when I was researching natural alternatives for Clinical Depression.  The illness and drugs the Doctors prescribed drove my sister to suicide and was well on it's way to killing me.  I turned to opiates in order to self medicate when all other alternatives were causing more harm than good.  After extensively researching Kratom I bought some at my local head shop and instantly found relief.  I did not feel high.  I felt normal.  I felt okay.  Kratom was a natural alternative to Suboxone and Methadone without side effects to get off of opiates.   It has relieved me of the debilitating pain that comes with Clinical Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, PTSD and Substance Abuse.  I wish that my sister were alive and that she could have tried this wonder herb.

Please reconsider this ban it's unnecessary and a horrible decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19060","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rachel Staples","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I substance.\nNo research supports any ground to ban it or consider it any more dangerous or addictive than hard drugs such as cigarettes, alcohol or all prescription pain killers that can be acquired more easily than m&m's. \nI do not support the use of any drug.

I discovered kratom earlier this year, in February I believe it was, as I was researching alternatives for pain control for my late husband. Brad (my late husband) was diagnosed with pancreatitis when he was 19 and was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis in January 2015 (age 40). His condition deteriorated rapidly from 2015 until his death on May 4, 2016 at age 41. During the last 16 months of his life, he suffered excruciating pain, depression, anxiety and addiction to his prescription pain medications. His functionality declined to the point that he was primarily bed bound, only getting up to walk to the bathroom. We did everything doctors told us to do but he continued to get worse and his pain medications continued to provide less and less pain relief. When I came across information about kratom, we decided to try it, after all what did we have to lose? Amazingly enough, on the days when Brad used kratom, he hurt less, he was a little more active, his appetite increased, nausea decreased, he was more alert and talkative, he felt lighter spiritually and emotionally, his mood was improved; he was a lot more enjoyable to spend time with. The differences in my late husband's entire demeanor and activity levels were very noticeable between the days that he would take kratom and those when he did not. On the days that he took kratom, he was more like himself before his health declined so much. I am extremely grateful for those days with kratom. I sincerely wish I had discovered kratom years ago as I believe it would have helped my late husband have a better life than what he ended up with. \n\nI decided to take kratom myself. I noticed that I slept better, I had more energy, and I felt better all around. I had a very large uterine fibroid that resulted in me having a hysterectomy in September 2016. Kratom helped me to remain functional and able to keep working prior to the surgery when I had excruciating pain from the tumor. Kratom has helped to balance my mood and sleep since the death of my husband and I believe that it helped me to recover from the surgery as well. Kratom helps me to remain functional when all I would want to do was lay in bed on a heating pad. Kratom helped my late husband and me deal with several health concerns. \n\nI firmly believe that kratom is extremely beneficial as a supplement for physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing and should not be added to the list of scheduled drugs. Kratom is a naturally occurring, God given plant and should not be made into an illegal substance. It has proven useful to countless individuals over the centuries and should remain available to people who wish to supplement their health and wellbeing with it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18907","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rachel Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, my name is Paul Ambartsumyan .

I have used low doses of opiate pain relievers for over a decade- low dose- no escalation in dosage or drug types.\n\nWhen I first read about Kratom, after the proposed ban, it captured my curiosity and I acquired some at a local shop and was interested in whether it might be a viable alternative to prescription pain medications. My first trial was a disappointment as the effects were not remarkable. I dismissed it for awhile until another article caught my attention and I did a bit more research. This led to me understand that different varieties and colors have vastly different effects. With this knowledge, I acquired samples of five different strains. These Kratom powders were of much higher quality than my first trial and with the first dose, I noticed a significant analgesic effect as well as clarity of thought contrary to that which is largely diminished with my usual hydrocodone. Additionally, when the effects wear off, the Kratom did not leave me tired and grumpy.\n\nOther strains do make one sleepier. Some were more likely to dull my thinking. The point is- That they all had DIFFERENT effects and characteristics.  \n\nAfter reading up on this, and discovering that there are so many in the community who are currently using Kratom to treat chronic pain, I think it would be highly irresponsible to ban this medicinal plant.  With the increased regulations on opiate pain prescriptions, doctors are more and more hesitant to prescribe them and many patients are left with nowhere to turn.\n\nI also might suggest that the gateways be opened to allow for further study of Kratom and its compounds as a viable alternative to opiates- which have left in their wake, a long trail of casualties. \n\nAt the very least, please allow for intelligent research into the safety and potential benefits of this plant.\nThough my expectations were low, I must say that there really is something to be said for this leaf and it's qualities!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20076","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom dramatically improves the quality of life of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans.

I have been struggling in the past four years since the death of my mother and living with my father has been far less than harmonious. \n\nIt has been nearly impossible to find a doctor to help me with my problems in the past few years. The ones I've seen prescribed me a few different anti-depressants and antipsychotics, or even stimulants and other drugs with awful side effects.\n\nWhile it isn't perfect, Kratom (or Mitragyna Speciosa), which is actually a cousin of coffee, has been a godsend for me. It has been helping me cope with all of these afflictions. It completely eases my social anxiety which helps me talk to people, it boosts my mood, helps me focus on things that need to get done including chores and exercising, and also alleviates the low mood nature of my depression. I've been taking it in addition to or in place of coffee, in fact, as coffee very much upsets my stomach. And, due to its chemistry, kratom has actually regulated my unfortunate digestive issues!\n\nWhen I found out about the emergency scheduling of Kratom, I immediately started crying. This is a heinous approach to a nonexistent situation. I have had zero negative effects from kratom since I've started taking it, with different blood tests to prove it.

The only problem I have had with Kratom such as side effects are headaches and sometimes my chest hurts from not eating while on them. There are withdrawals from stopping kratom abruptly but its nothing compared to Pain pills or Xanax. ABSOLUTLEY nothing like the pain pills or Xanax. Ive had anxiety, headahces, bodyaches and loss of appetite from getting off of Kratom. Please do more research before you guys outlaw this amazing drug.

It is so bad that my doctor had me taking time released Requip (Ropinirole HCR)at a dosage higher than recommended.  It still did not completely solve my problem.  In many cases I had to also consume a prescription sleep aid.  My father has Parkinson's Disease and he was prescribed the same medication.  When he discovered that I was prescribed the same medication he discussed it with his doctor and she was very much NOT in support of what I was taking.  She felt I was to young (45yrs at the time) and the repercussions later on in life would be bad. She suggested a few things that may help but nothing worked.  \n\nin 2014 I discovered Kratom at a convention.  Having numerous health issues, I tried it for its ability to help with sleeping. The vendor promised it would help but I was very skeptical. I took the sample home and tried it that night.  To my disbelief, not only did it help, it removed ALL of the symptoms I had in entirety.  I now am truly convinced that it is a god send.  My partner now sleeps better without my jerking around and getting up and down and my entire life has changed.  I do not know what I would do without it.  To claim that it has no medical value is a very poor assumption.  I urge you to speak to my significant other, she would argue with you till the end.  Taking this natural herb away from us is nothing short of a disaster.  \n\nAllowing this product to be available is so critical to our lives I cannot even begin to explain.  There are nights that I do not have it and they remind me of the horrible days without Kratom.  I cannot even have the supply interrupted or my sleepless nights begin again.  Please reconsider this action.  I have NEVER had ANY side effects or consume more than what it takes or use it for recreational purposes.\n\nBecause Kratom works but without clinical trials to guarantee safety, I would never give it to my child, however, I personally do not feel I need it to be overlooked by a doctor for my consumption.  I would strongly suggest the demand for adult supervision and a purchase requirement of 18 years of age.  I also would not mind that you provide regulation on this product by responsible companies to assure the product is safe since it comes from a third world country.

In the beginning it was occasional use, and by the time that I was ready to seek help, I had pills on my nightstand to take 15 minutes before I even got out of bed. I discovered the buzz as a very motivated feeling that made me much more social, and I was able to work very long hours. My first encounter with oxycodone was when I hade my wisdom teeth pulled many years before it became an addiction. In 2007 I found out I was going to be a father, and that's when I truly realised that I had a very large problem on my hands. So, I decided to seek help from a specialist. I went to a psychologist once a week, and a counselor on another day. I felt it was the proper thing to do. The psyc doctor was very crude and not interested in any history of abuse or anything in my life, she simply wrote prescriptions for suboxone, and claimed I was self medicating for \"add\", in which she prescribed adderall  ( a highly addictive amphetamine).  These two medications combined gave me extreme anxiety and night terrors, so she then wrote another scipt for another addictive drug, a benzodiazepine called klonopin.  Ilived like a zombie for 4 years on this cocktail of dangerous and even lethal combo of drugs for approximately 4 years. I no longer wanted to be a slave to these pharmaceuticals and naively decided t stop cold turkey. By the end of the first week my misery from withdrawal symptoms was so awful I was on the verge of suicide,  ironically enough, thats when i descovered the organic herb kratom during a web search  for help. I ordered a small amount and had it shipped priority. When the package came I believe I was at the peak of w/d. I very skeptically  made a tea out of the ground up leaves,and drank it. In about 15 minutes, my symptoms were still there but probably cut in half.  I had a feeling like \" I can get through this!\". I have continued with great success to stay away from dangerous prescriptions,, both legal and illegal for the past 5 years. Instead of chasing pills out on the street, If I get an urge to relapse, or have a few too many drinks, Im at home with my family making a harmless kratom  tea. Comparing kratom to these dangerous opiates, would be in the same ballpark as comparing methamphetamine to coffee. Kratom alone has not a single death on its hands. I ask, with much respect, please consider the thousands of people that this gentle herb has greatly improved the lives of. People from all different walks of life. At, a time when prescription drug abuse has become an epidemic along with heroin, it would be down right irresponsible to make it unavailable to the people.

At the age of 19, I was prescribed benzodiazepines (Xanax, Klonopin) for PTSD, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, as well as Paxil for depression.  I became addicted to these drugs, which led me down a devastating path for ten years.  In September of last year, I decided to change my life.  \n\nA friend of mine, who is a nurse, told me about Kratom and how it was being used across the world to help people stop taking dangerous opioid and benzo prescriptions.  I started drinking Kratom Tea about three months after I stopped taking my prescriptions.  After a few weeks of using Kratom, the anxiety and depression that had plagued me for years was starting to subside.  \n\nI have now been using Kratom for 10 months and I feel that I have made more progress in the last ten months than I have in years; such as successfully treating the underlying issues of anxiety disorder and major depression.  This amazing plant has changed my life.  I am now a college student, I work part time and raise my daughter as a single mother.  I stopped drinking alcohol and currently do not take any prescription medication.  I do not think that I would be thriving as well as I am without the natural, medicinal properties of Kratom.\n\nI honestly fear for the addicts in our country if Kratom is banned.  I believe there will be more overdoses and death due to people finding other ways to relieve their physical, mental, and emotional pain.  In the handful of states where kratom has been banned, such as Alabama, the number of opiate-related deaths increased significantly following the implementation of the ban. \n\nThank you so much for your consideration in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDeeAnna L.

I first began using kratom about eight years ago after spending the preceding two years repeatedly trying and failing to break an addiction to opiates which began as a result of knee surgery. Kratom went a long way in terms of decreasing my cravings and withdrawals without leaving me intoxicated, and I truly believe that I would not have been able to quit using opiates had I not discovered kratom. \n\nWhile I still use kratom occasionally for pain relief from more minor issues (normally just when I have a cold), quitting daily use was not a challenge by any means, which leads me to believe that the concerns people have expressed over addiction to kratom are entirely unwarranted. Additionally, I have not suffered any adverse health effects as a result of kratom use, and regular liver and kidney screenings (which were done because of an unrelated concern) during the period that I was taking kratom daily, always showed normal function and enzyme levels. While I know that one persons experience isnt necessarily representative of the larger population, given that there are thousands upon thousands of reported kratom users in the US at the moment, I think that if kratom were any sort of threat to public health, these issues would have become apparent in scientific literature long ago. I believe that banning a natural plant that many people find helps them with a number of different problems, but that does not pose a threat to its users health, would be completely counterproductive.\n\nA ban on kratom also scares me because I worry about the possibility of relapsing into opiate addiction if I ever had to undergo another medical procedure requiring the use of strong anesthetics (and there is a strong likelihood that I will have to undergo another knee surgery at some point), but also because such a ban would greatly limit ongoing and future scientific research on this plant, depriving everyone of any medical potential it may hold.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18775","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John K","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is James Wilkerson and I use kratom to treat chronic pain.

Kratom was an extremely effective pain reliever for over three years and I am devastated that it is no longer available here.\n\nDo not subject others to my fate!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1780","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Wilkerson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Vanessa Lozada, age 34, critical care administration\n \nKratom should not be listed as a schedule 1 controlled substance\n \nI have not yet started taking kratom, but I am very interested in furthering research.\n \nI suffer from fibromyalgia, and chronic pain, related to an autoimmune disease caused UCTD (Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease), as well as a car accident nearly ten years ago.\n \nI am unable to take sufficient pain medication to get back to my baseline.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n In 2007 I was diagnosed with both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, a disease that burdens me with daily persistent chronic pain, and is causing the deterioration of my joints. Later in 2008, I was diagnosed with the bone disease avascular necrosis in my left hip. This added more severe, often unbearable, chronic pain to deal with in my life. In Feb. 2009, I had a core decompression, bone graft, and titanium implant surgery on my left hip. Most excrutiatingly painful thing I've ever experienced in my life. Walking(limping with the assistance of my trusty cane) would never be the same again. The rheumatoid arthritis kicked into high gear after this. Flare-ups were worse than any worst case of flu one could imagine having. The bad flare-ups still are. On top of all this, I still have to deal with eye disease and ocular migraines. I was born with macular dystrophy. In 2001, I began having many problems seeing, so I got a referral to a retinal specialist. Lattice degeneration was added to my list. As the years progressed, retinal holes had to be lasered closed, a diagnosis of Pseudo Foster-Kennedy Syndrome was added to my list, and then in May 2015 I had an optic nerve stroke(Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)) in my right eye, leaving me legally blind in that eye. In October of this year I was diagnosed with glaucoma to add to my list. The opthalmologist told me every layer of my eyes are diseased, and that I basically have the equivalent of the eyes of an 80 yr. old man. This explained my headaches. The debilitating migraines I get some days are also unbearable at times. But, chronic pain is my way of life. It is a daily struggle to deal with it. The doctors prescribed medicines that I hated the way they made me feel(not myself), and the side effects of these medications that were supposed to be helping me soon outweighed any supposed benefits. As my diseases advanced, I decided to take it upon myself to start researching Native American and Asian culture natural plant based/herbal medicines. It was my studies of southeast Asian cultural traditional natural plant based medicines medicine that led me to the Kratom plant. I soon discovered that the powdered leaf of this plant when brewed as a tea did wonders for my way of life, especially dealing with the constant chronic pain. No negative side effects ... ever ... and my chronic pain was bearable to where I could function at least somewhat normally(considering my limited mobility ability). I also noticed that I wasn't having near the rheumatoid arthritis complications/flare-ups as when I was taking the doctor prescribed pharmaceuticals. Inflammation seemed to be kept in check, too. The kratom plant has helped me tremendously, safely and effectively, in the 6+ years that I have been using it brewed as a tea. Kratom changed my life for the better. When the DEA announced its letter of intent to ban this medicinal plant leaf as a Schedule 1 substance on August 31, 2016, I was devastated. Panic, sadness/depression, and soon anger began to set in. Another freedom was being taken away at the hands of government overreach. I'm left questioning whether or not this is still America I'm living in, land of the free. I thought that I have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I'm not a criminal. I don't drink alcohol, or use illegal drugs. I'm a responsible 50 year old law abiding adult citizen. The fact that I'm trying to improve my health and well being with medicinal plants is a threat to whom? No-one! No harm, no foul. I'm not doing anything to anyone else, or their property, by drinking kratom tea. I'm living my life the best way that I can. Living with constant chronic pain isn't easy. Kratom has improved my quality of life where the medicines that my doctors prescribed previously have failed. The leaf of a tree brewed as a tea can effectively improve my life of chronic pain, safely. Years of experience prove that. How is that a hazard to me, or anyone else? It isn't. Perhaps it would be better for the DEA to concentrate their focus on the real deadly drug problems spiraling out of control in this country ... Prescription opioids/opiate abuse and the heroin epidemic. It is my opinion that the medicinal plants are part of the solution.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18716","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Darin Wilson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be banned, but used instead of opioids in the treatment of pain and pain management.

Mitragyna speciosa has been a great substitute for coffee for me in my final year at college, while eliminating stressful college test anxiety. It has also helps with schoolwork as a focus enhancer. I have been making kratom tea for a year now and am happily able to say It has helped me, as I will be graduating from Illinois State University on December 17th with the class of 2016. In my moderate consumption of drinking a kratom tea that I make, I have found this plant to have subtle yet very helpfull effects. I don't need any crutches that many college students abuse such as \"adderall, Vyvanse, or Ritalin\" for studying. I have responsibility talked to my doctor about health effects. I am an athlete who stays very hydrated on a strict diet and kratom has not yielded my health in any way, and there has been no side effects with my scheduled regular diet in small doses. I have stopped the continuation of substituting kratom with coffee and had no addictive side effects. Coffee and other energy drinks actually had more side effects such as jitteriness, loss of appetite, and digestive problems. After researching Mitragyna speciosa (kratom) it was only until opium exportation sales, \"the United States street drug Heroin,\" went down in Thailand, that it was governed forbidden due to the health effects it had on reversal of heroin addiction. Before money was an issue to the governments it is grown in, chewing on kratom showed workers were happier and less stressed. Why should there be a ban on a plant made into tea that helped a twenty three year old full time college student with a part time job, study more?

There are over 24 peer reviewed studies pointing to Kratom's safety and no one has ever died due to Kratom alone.

We also detox patients from drugs and alcohol. I regularly hear tragic stories about the effects of addiction in our patients' lives, most often opioid addiction. Individuals from every walk of life are losing loved ones to this terrible, yet treatable disease. I believe we should provide addicts with as many resources as possible to get clean and remain sober. If this includes the use of kratom (and/or its compounds), a plant in the same family as coffee, common sense says we should keep this plant legal, at least until its benefits and negative effects are thoroughly researched and compared.\n\nHere are some statistics to consider:\n\nIn 2014, there were 18,893 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 10,574 overdose deaths related to heroin (29,467 total deaths) (https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006). Over the past 2 years, this epidemic has increasingly run rampant, and there are more and more cases of opioid/opiate overdoses each year. Additionally, the rate of opioid abuse by adolescents has increased, which means our children are becoming addicts, which often results in them squandering their future or losing their lives.\n\nEvery day, over 1,000 people are treated in emergency departments for misusing prescription opioids, which adds up to 365,000 each year (http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html). This is a huge financial burden, but more importantly, lives are lost. There are numerous users who overdose and die before reaching the hospital.\n\nAdditionally, addiction is often dually diagnosed with mental illness, which is another issue in itself. \n  \nIt is suspected that 15 deaths in the United States between 2014 and 2016 were kratom-related. However, there is no evidence that kratom is the sole contributor to an individual's death ( Warner ML, Kaufman NC, Grundmann O (2016). \"The pharmacology and toxicology of kratom: from traditional herb to drug of abuse\". Int. J. Legal Med.).\n\nSo, how is opioid addiction treated now? One of the most popular methods involves doctors prescribing buprenorphine (subutex, suboxone). Not everyone has insurance or the financial means to afford this medication, and many do not have access to doctors who are qualified to prescribe this medication. Meanwhile, kratom can be purchased online and delivered to their doorstep. As a result, kratom and/or its compounds could potentially be an alternative form of treatment for this population.\n\nSo, please, I beg you, compare the aforementioned statistics: 29,467 total opioid/opiate deaths in ONE year (2014) vs. 15 potential kratom-related deaths in two years. \n\nDoes it still make sense to ban kratom and its compounds before we rigorously research and explore its benefits? No, not at all. It's simply an illogical, irresponsible, and immoral knee-jerk reaction Even if kratom reduces the number of lives lost by a small percentage, it is worth it. \n\nThink of the lives and relationships it could save, psychiatric disorders it could prevent, and its health benefits. \n\nAt least give it a chance. \n\nThank you for your time. \n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6631","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steven Anderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think Kratom should remain legal.

I am a 50 year old mother of 3 who suffers from debilitating chronic pain, panic & anxiety disorder, and depression. I am also a recovering alcoholic (11mo!). I am very concerned regarding the potential scheduling of a natural botanical called Kratom, which I have found to be a safe and effective herbal remedy, related to the coffee family, and consumed like a chamomile tea. \n\nIn the early 90's I was diagnosed with Endometriosis and by 2001 I had been diagnosed with Major Depression, Fibromyalgia (which no one really knew much about), TMJ, and learned I had hypothyroidism. It was wonderful being able to put a label on all the ailments I experienced but I was also immediately placed on the pharmaceutical superhighway and felt like I lived inside a doctors waiting room. With each new side effect of a previously prescribed drug, I was given yet another drug to take to combat the side effects. After multiple various doctor visits, surgeries, and being on the strongest pain med available at a very high dosage, along with antidepressants, muscle relaxants, and various other meds, I simply could no longer function. All the joy in my heart, left. I lived in a fog, my memory waned, I couldn't focus, I had no energy or stamina, I couldn't properly parent my children, and I developed a dependence on alcohol just to be sociable, and to dull the pain that the prescribed medication wouldn't touch. No person should have to live their life around the schedule of taking 15 different medications, doctor's appointments, or depending on alcohol to function, which in itself created more problems and worse pain. Ultimately, I lost my full time job of over 16 years, and I almost lost my life after having collapsed into a coma. I woke up feeling like such a failure; as a mother, as an employee, as a citizen, and as a human being.\n \nUpon leaving the hospital last December, void of any other substances in my system and a God given determination to find a better way, I decided to go a more holistic route and discovered after much research, a natural botanical called Kratom. I had never heard of it before but after reading testimonies of the experience of others, and information available including scientific research, I decided to try it. To my delight, with this wonderful plant I was able to wean off many of the prescriptions (including the pain medications), therefore reducing the many side effects of those drugs. I was also able to no longer depend on alcohol to self medicate. I don't have a taste for it, there are no cravings, I don't need it. Supplementing my treatment plan with this God given botanical has allowed me to focus again on something other than my pain. It has given me energy where before I had none, and I have begun to live life again. And although I know it will be a long road back to the person I once was, I have hope.\n \nNow the government intends to ban Kratom, making myself and all those benefiting from its healing powers into criminals overnight! I finally find a natural way to gain my independence and be productive, and that avenue is now threatened. This I just do not understand.  Where are my unalienable rights that are guaranteed in the Declaration of Independence upon which the government is supposed to protect? Why don't I have the right to pursue happiness? Where is my liberty, my FREEDOM TO CHOOSE? It should be illegal to criminalize nature! We Americans should not be mere pawns in the DEA, the FDA, and big pharma's game of chess. Many chronic pain sufferers will have no choice but to be bedridden again. Many will go back to being drug addicts as well. Not by choice, but by necessity. If Kratom does indeed become illegal, some of us will not even survive. I know of many military vets whose lives have been saved due to Kratom. Those who fought for our freedom, why is our government now taking away theirs? And mine. \n\nI don't want to go back to that dark and lonely place, that place of being a non-functioning, unproductive, bedridden sick person, instead of the vibrant person I can be again thanks to Kratom. It is not a road I want to go down again. When the greed of our government overrules quality of life there is no justice and all is lost. When you can't live life free from pain by using what nature provides, so others can line their own pockets, there is no freedom, only pain. \n\nAn acceptable and more responsible route to take would be to place regulations on Kratom. Regulations for strength and purity, age limits and warning labels. An even better route to take would be to let the kratom community (such as the AKA) self regulate following the guidelines set forth by the FDA, but please do not place this on the scheduled list of drugs. It needs to remain available to us in its most natural form, inexpensively, and from responsible vetted vendors. Kratom is not a drug, it is a God given plant.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nDEA-2016-0015","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7537","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"C.

I was an athlete through college, which gave me many injuries and lifelong pain. I was prescribed an opiate pain medication. Within six months, I was addicted. I started selling everything I owned in order to support my habit. I am a single father, and was mentally absent from his life. This is when I first seeked help.\n   After I finally admitted that I was slowly destroying my life, I checked myself in a detox program. I spent a week there, left, and immediately started using again as soon as my pain and anxiety became too much to handle. This cycle continued for over a year, until I waa arrested for selling property that didn't belong to me. My eight year old son watched his father get put in handcuffs and thrown in jail. This was a turning point in my destructive cycle. I began researching different methods of staying sober and living a productive life. This is when I found kratom.\n   The first time I tried kratom, I immediately knew that I was onto something great. My pain and anxiety just disappeared. I noticed no symptoms of euphoria, however being pain free was euphoric in itself. It was an immediate difference in my life. \n   I have now been sober for over two years. I still use kratom at times for my pain and anxiety, but I also go periods without using it at all. It is definitely not harmful or addictive. My son is much happier now to have his father back. I am back in college. My life is improving daily. Kratom is to thank for saving my life! \n   Thank you for reading my comments. It is very important that kratom remain legal. There are lives being saved on a daily basis thanks to this plant.

I understand the DEA is taking a careful look at banning Kratom and I would like to give you my input in hopes that you will reconsider. I am a USAF veteran and have worked federal government in the past before moving to my family business. I discovered Kratom a few years ago after looking for non-psychedelic treatment for my pain. While others were seeking to legalize a very different plant, I myself was looking for something to help with the pain without mind-altering side effects. Kratom comes in many strains and several of them help in different ways. As my job is often laborious I suffer from pains that Kratom has helped to alleviate. Furthermore Kratom has helped with motivation, energy and depression as anyone who has used the plant will agree. It has helped my quality of life and has allowed me to abstain from the other well-known plant that causes unnecessary side effects when taken to include making obtaining employment difficult. That was a joke. Laugh. It is my hopes that you will reconsider your decision to ban this plant. I recognize the intent of the DEA is to protect people from harmful substances but this is not one of them. The recreational value is minimal considering it's users are unable to ingest food before or after taking it, the taste is quite bitter, the substance cannot be administered any other way than orally and is not addictive therefore does not cause it's users to develop habits. I am heartened that you gave the public the opportunity to communicate with you, I hope that my words have helped to convince you of Kratom's medical value.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4483","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Westley Bisson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using this plant product for several years now.

I believe taking Kratom is better than going to the doctor getting sleeping pills. There are many people taking too many medications from the doctor. Prescription pills is the real problem we have in this world. The government and people should focus on how to stop this prescription drug abuse instead of worrying about Kratom.

I have been married for 15 years to the love of my life, who also happens to be a public servant as a firefighter/paramedic. Prior to being a full time mom, I worked at an advertising company for 10 years. I am a college educated woman, graduating at the top of my class with a degree in English from a private university. I am a volunteer at my kids' middle school and was a Girl Scout Troop Leader for 8 years. I am also a chronic pain sufferer due to bulging discs in my lumbar spine from a car accident in 2008 and was diagnosed with a chronic pain and fatigue disorder called fibromyalgia in 2015. See, I gave some basic information about myself and my life first, because I want you to see me for the upstanding member of society that I am before I told you about my pain problems. That's because I'm not an addict or a drug seeker, as we with chronic pain are often assumed to be.  I'm just a regular suburban wife and mother that is unlucky enough to suffer from pain and fatigue every day of my life. Before I was introduced to Kratom by a woman in my fibromyalgia support group, my only relief came from narcotic pain killers. I always receive my medication from a reputable specialist and always take it as prescribed, but because there is such a high risk of abuse, addiction and side effects, I must comply with urinalysis and blood tests to qualify for the medication. Since I started taking Kratom a few months ago, I've been able to significantly decrease my use of these pain killers. That's a load off my mind because I've been concerned for some time now about the long term effects of these medications on my health. I've done as much research as possible on Kratom and I can't find any evidence of Kratom causing any dangerous side effects at all. From what I've read and from my experience, it's also not addictive, which as you know is a huge problem with opiate pain killers. It's also not possible to overdose on Kratom. It seems to be a safe way to significantly reduce my pain and fatigue, and that it does. It has improved my life so much in the short time that I've been taking it. It's given me hope that I now have a safe and effective way to manage this debilitating disease that I will suffer from for the rest of my life unless a cure is found. Instead of classifying this supplement as a class 1 substance, we should be thanking God and celebrating that there is a safe and effective alternative to narcotic pain medication.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why making Kratom illegal is even a consideration! I suppose it's difficult to appreciate the importance of Kratom in the life of someone like me if you've never suffered from years of daily pain and fatigue.  Every day I had to fight to keep this disease from dragging me down into depression and hopelessness.  I know that probably sounds dramatic, but imagine feeling flu-like fatigue and body-wide pain every single day, knowing that you will never get better without becoming depressed. Trust me, it's a struggle. Kratom has given me hope. Please, I'm begging you, don't take my hope away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4287","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Crompton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not dangerous, it's natural, and has beneficial properties.

I have no facts as I am not a scientist, I can only offer my experience with this wonderful plant. Experiences such as a recent blood test performed six months after my daily use, while on kratom. The full panel test resulted in perfect numbers all around, except for my cholesterol which was 7 points high. I am sure kratom is not responsible as I have a history of high cholesterol, only this recent test showed that it is the lowest it has ever been. This test was a must for me as I was concerned that there was such little information available for kratom. \n  This demonization of natural remedies must stop as it only results in ignorance. The total lack of information is a result of no one being allowed to study or experiment because of unjust and hasty laws. Laws that are in direct opposition of truth. Truth is all we want.

The Kratom worked so well that I was able to ween myself away from expensive anxiety medication I've been taking for ~10 years.  Now, instead of medication, I drink (1) cup of Kratom tea every morning, and (1) cup every afternoon, and my anxiety \"problem\" is controlled (i.e., no longer a problem).  When I'm not able to have my Kratom tea for whatever reason, I have absolutely no problem whatsoever going days without it (i.e., it is NOT addictive).  My only complaint is that is doesn't taste very good.  I also suffer from Restless Leg Syndrome.  If I have a flare-up, I drink a cup of Kratom tea and the problem goes away for 4-6 hours.\n\nSince using Kratom, I've found other benefits from it.

When I use Kratom somewhat regularly, I find my blood pressure is consistently reduced to a level my doctor finds healthier.\n\nLast, Kratom has benefited my digestive system greatly.  For many years, I've been plagued by acid reflux, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation.  When I drink Kratom somewhat regularly, my acid reflux and indigestion is MINIMAL.  Also, my bowels are much better regulated with the Kratom.  Instead of diarrhea and constipation, I find my bowels are better regulated than ever before, presumably due to the high fiber content of Kratom tea.  Also, at ~$1.00 per cup, it is extremely affordable!\n\nI have had NO negative side effects from Kratom.  NONE.  Again, my only complaint is that it's like drinking dirt.  However, the benefits have been tremendous for me, and I would hate to see Kratom banned.  A ban of Kratom would force me back to a doctor to find other, more costly remedies for problems I manage well today with Kratom.\n\nPlease contact me for more information about my Kratom success story.  Please, for the love of God, don't ban it.  Do proper research.  It is certainly NOT addictive, nor is it even remotely dangerous unless it is extremely concentrated, which requires expensive chemical processing of which most people don't have the capability.  it just tastes bad!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9845","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lucien Maranda","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop scheduling drugs illegal.

There are many of us that utilize Kratom for our ailments and treatable conditions such as chronic pain and opiate addiction. Taking Kratom away from those people  Kratom has played an important role in my life, says Maximum King, who suffers from chronic back pain; due to degenerative disk disease and two disk herniations, I constantly have to deal with pain, Kratom makes it possible for me to get through those difficult moments without subjecting to opiate drugs or other narcotic pain killers. Max has a past history using opiates, before he hurt his back, he never want to use opiates again. Kratom is a savior in my life, not only has it helped me with my pain, it has also been a huge contributor towards keeping me away from opiates which is major. Max prepares Kratom into a drink with hot water and organic Kratom leaf powder, which he buys online from a vendor out of Pennsylvania that sources their Kratom from farmers all over the world. The price for an ounce usually ranges from 8-15 USD, you can buy it in bulk in its leaf powder form or premade into pills or resin. Kratom is not addictive and does not lead to withdrawal symptoms, except when egregiously abused. First off, we should clarify exactly what it means to be addicted to a substance like Kratom. Under the technical definition, an addiction is a physical dependence on some substance that creates a strong and harmful need to this thing regularly. Addiction causes a literal rewiring of circuits in your brain that makes you dependent on constantly having some chemical compound. Kratom is not addictive in this sense, making it quite different from other natural pain medicines or drugs like opium and heroin. However, Kratom may be habit forming or cause some type of psychological dependence if it is continuously abused for long periods of time. the addictive potential was considered to be less than the caffeine in coffee.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20340","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"KRATOM WARRIORS","postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket#2016-24659  My name is Susan Seidler.

I found Kratom after many years of living in acute pain. I have been through pain mgt. I have been put on every RX med possible, been through so many tests and spinal injections. I hate narcotics prescribed by physicians & stopped taking them because I did not like the feeling & did not want to be addicted . I have just existed and not really living life. I have missed family gatherings, events,time with my husband, trips, and basically would lay on the couch or bed and cry. I could never make plans in advance. Kratom has given me back my life with NO bad side effect. I can go places, clean, attend gatherings and pre plan going to events without the fear that I would have to cancel. My energy is back and I am a very happy woman. Small things that other people take for granted I can do now. My daughter cried when she saw I found relief because he was so happy. She said I have my OLD Mom back..the one who did everything with me..this made me so happy. Please do not ban Kratom! I am begging you as I would be back in the old life just existing! I am a upstanding citizen who abides the law. PLEASE do not take my new life away and force me to go to the DR & get poison RX pills.

By putting Kratom on any level of a schedule, especially schedule 1, the DEA, especially the acting head Chuck Rosenberg, is becoming more and more suspect by many, perhaps millions of siding and taking money from big pharmaceutical company(s).  We have not money left to fight yet another innocent herb that helps people.  People that have tried the prescription medications only to see liver and kidney failure.  The numbers are far, far more than the 15-25 international death where Kratom was included as the culprit.  In 9 of those cases Tramadol was clearly the culprit as you never Tramadol with other medications for fear of concomitant syndrome.  Kratom is a safe leaf used for over 1000 years in Asia to treat ailments of all kinds.  It is not an opiate nor does not bind to opiate receptors, it \"mimics\" opiate binding that give people focus or less depression.  Many believe big pharmaceutical is behind this to eliminate their main competition as the Internet spreads word fast.  There is also a movement of people that tell a person what are the safe vendors, each strain of Kratom's capability and what a particular type is good for, regulations on how much to take lest one become nauseous.  Kratom helps or even cures depression and anxietywith now need of liver or kidney damaging MAOI's and SSRI's that are prescribed.   Helps one stay focused on their job so they can perform better.  Helps with OCD and ADHD.  Helps with pain management so no real need for opiate based prescription drugs and even helps safely detox a person from Heroin and many other drugs that are dangerous to human health.  Please keep Kratom legal completely.  However I am in favor of DHEC or even an agent doing surprise checks at random to check for the qualkity and safety of product sold and make sure it's not \"laced\" with something.   It is not a bath salt or synthetic marijuana.  It is a safe leaf.  Imagine if the DEA were around when caffeine - The Coffee bean would have been banned, or peanut butter. Even bottled water is not safe to drink except for a few good providers. Kratom s safe.

I've seen a powerful response so far that's renewed my trust in the Democratic system quite a bit.\n\n  As per my subject line I would like to bring your attention momentarily to the fact that when someone tries to abuse Kratom the effects have a ceiling limit to effectively imposed by a mild to moderate nausea from ingesting large amount of plant material. Again I don't see how this could possibly kill anyone or cause them to even steal, but I CERTAINLY see how it could prevent someone from overdosing or spending all their resources on heroin or opioid pharmaceuticals. As someone who has battled with opioid addiction before, I can say that there is a very good chance that without the alternative herb Kratom, the occasional overdoses that occur would have possibly killed me by now. Now I have a chance to make a difference in the world. I believe the USA by and large is a mature enough community to handle this in an  effective and non xenophobic fashion. I hope this information  was useful to you in someway and conveyed my concern, npt just for my own personal use, but for the opportunity of potential addicts everywhere whom I have been recommending this herb to at every juncture.

Even though I often enjoyed the experiences, I completely understand why they are controlled substances. I believe the DEA is acting in the American public's best interests by controlling them. \n\nIncluding Kratom among those substances would be flatly absurd. It's eyebrow-raisingly incongruent with the nature of the substances which are already scheduled, and would very much hurt a small, sincere and productive segment of the population who enjoy the effects of kratom for non-chemical relief from chronic pain, anxiety, opiate addiction and more.\n\nIf you have not yet tried kratom, I suggest you do. I feel certain you will agree with me that it is miles away from a \"fun\" drug, and you will understand within one experience with it that it has almost no potential for abuse.\n\nKratom has a lot in common with other herbal/natural nootropics people take to better themselves. It has nothing in common with drugs people take for fun, or to forget their current reality. That includes marijuana and alcohol.\n\nI began taking kratom last year because I heard it helped some people successfully manage depression and social anxiety. I was diagnosed with both many years ago, but find the side effects of SSRIs and other prescription treatments VERY detrimental to the quality of my life.\n\nKratom helps me not feel terrified of every one and every thing. It helps me to not obsess over negative details and instead see a broader, healthier, more complete picture. It helps me feel ok.\n\nSince I started including kratom in my nutritional supplement regimen, where it takes a natural place alongside substances like 5-HTP, Vitamin D, green tea and fish oil, I've vastly improved the quality of my life. My small business has taken off and is making twice the profit it was before kratom. I've started working out several times a week, and have toned up and lost weight. My relationships are healthy and satisfying for the first time in my life.\n\nDread, which used to be my go-to mental state, rarely makes an appearance these days. I feel a normal level of self-confidence. I feel motivated to succeed at life.\n\nPlease leave kratom alone. We who benefit from it in ways we're deeply grateful for will appreciate your lack of action more than words can express.\n\nPS - The proposed scheduling of kratom has had an effect I don't imagine the DEA expected or desired. It brought kratom widespread focus and attention, and much of that attention is coming from the young people I imagine the DEA is seeking to \"protect\" from it. Now people who will not benefit from kratom are interested in it because they believe it will be an enjoyable \"high.\" I'm sorry the attention you've paid kratom has had this effect. But it's really not a big deal; they'll try it once or twice and find out that unless they're suffering from chronic pain, crippling anxiety or a prescription pill habit they'd like to break, it's not worth their while. \n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8714","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is the best for someone who has had enough of the opiates that almost took over my life.

Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

I now compete in full contact Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and am a full time advertising account executive. I found Kratom by accident, when purchasing Kava from a vendor, they sent me a sample. It was almost a god send of a supplement. Having suffered a torn rotator cuff, knee injuries, broken ribs, torn ligaments, the list goes on and on, I found an alternative to taking opiates after an injury. I have never experienced any negative effects from taking Kratom as a daily supplement, and I am confused why anyone would consider this a 'drug' to get 'high' with. You do not get high, you get clean, healthy, pain relief. \nMy father has spent his life training and I introduced him to adding Kratom into his daily regime. For the first time in years, he could fully perform his job and also sleep a full night's sleep. \nInstead of taking opiates, and possibly getting addicted like so many other peers of mine, I chose alternative solutions and Kratom is one of them. If Kratom is banned, I will be forced to take the opiates that they prescribe to me for pain relief after injuries.\nIn addition to athletic injuries, I was recently diagnosed with Cluster Headaches. These are extremely painful and the medication to help with them causes havoc on my body. They make me incapable of even going to work. With the help of adding Kratom into my daily routine, I have increased my attendance rate at work, and can be a fully functioning person. Not only were the prescription meds taking a toll on my body, they were causing rebound headaches and I felt like I was getting nowhere in regards to my treatment. \nAnother instance where, if Kratom is banned, I fear that the pain from my cluster headaches will result in me losing my job and therefore no longer being a contributing member of society. I cant even fathom what would happen if that was the case. \n\nI barely take tylenol as it is, and live a very clean and healthy lifestyle. Kratom is a part of that lifestyle and I have been consuming it for years. Whenever I get my labs done, I come back as healthy as someone in their early 20s. If I was taking opiates as often as they get prescribed to me - I dont think I could say the same thing.\n\nKeeping Kratom legal not only will help me, but will help hundreds of thousands of other people continue to live a healthy lifestyle, eliminating opiate addiction, therefore lowering health care costs and potentially saving lives. In addition, Kratom is a plant, dried, and then crushed into powder. You cant get anymore natural then that! \n\nThank you for your time.\n\nBest, \nApril Crone","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1524","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"April Crone","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I really hope you dont take kratom off the shelf.

We started Kratomade after realizing the benefit Kratom offers as a herbal supplement. Unlike our competitors in this market we fell Kratom should only be allowed to be purchased by persons 21 years of age and older. Banning this substance and forcing people back to precscription drugs (if they can even afford it) that have proven to hurt and in worse cases even killed more than helped is not showing love and compassion that this country was built upon.  \n\nThe ones that cannot afford the prescription drugs will be forced to obtain either illegal drugs or drugs from overseas pharmacies. Millions of people lives are better because of Kratom not worse. I wish I could say that about just one type of prescribed pain pill but unfortunately I cannot. I am writing you to request that you really take a look at what the effects would have on our nation if this substance is banned. \n\nThe DEA's decision to classify Kratom as a Schedule 1 substance is unjust. I, as well as some of my staff and hundreds if not thousands of others depend on this plant to be able to get up and walk every day. I have have multiple surgeries on my knee and with Kratom I am able to get up and be a productive member of our society. I beg you to delay this bill as you will not only be taking away my ability to walk without the need of prescription drugs, that I cannot afford, but you will also take away my livelihood. \n\nI feel this will not solve a problem but will only create more deaths and even more problems that our government will have to finance. From incarceration to paying for military funerals. Thousands of our veterans rely on this for their PTSD issues and could cause some to commit suicide, as I have read online. I urge you to seriously weigh the pro's and con's as to what will happen to member's of our great nation by making Kratom a Schedule 1 substance. Please consider increasing the age limit to 21 years of age or old instead of making Kratom illegal. \n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this letter and will be praying for good news.

I have had multiple MRI'S and MRA'S performed on me as well as being hospitalized due to severe headaches. For 10 years I was treated with Percocet and other heavy narcotics to help to relieve the pain. After years of being prescribed the opiates I became depended on them and it grew into an addiction. I'm 2010 I admitted myself into rehabilitation because I was tired of the side effects and the dependency it had become. In 2011 I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. After talking to my therapists, it was something I had for many years. I was prescribed lorazepam and Xanax. Once again it grew into another dependency and again I place myself into rehabilitation. Soon after I started researching natural ways to help with the pain from clusters and the anxieties from depression. I found kratom after months of researching. For the last 2 years kratom has helped to deal with both the pain and anxiety. It has help me become a  loving husband, father, grandfather and co-worker again. I no longer am anti social and I have regained living a healthy lifestyle and thanks to kratom and my willingness I am happy again. I still have very bad days when my headaches become active and I know kratom isn't a cure for the severe cluster headaches and anxiety but it really has helped me be a more productive citizen in society and i no longer have the addictions from opiates or benzos. My physician and family compliment me all the time because of the way I have changed my life around.

I struggled with depression, anxiety and chronic back pain for much of my adult life, and sometimes drank too much alcohol and occasionally took opiates to combat these symptoms  This drinking wasn't so much of a problem that it interfered with my career or life in general, but I was always looking for something else to provide a relaxing, non-toxic means of relief.  I do not enjoy marijuana, so this wasn't an option, and other herbal supplements were found ineffective.  \n\nUpon discovering kratom, I immediately lost all desire to drink alcohol or take other drugs, and my pain and depression has been greatly reduced.  I find kratom to be an excellent pain reliever, mood booster, and effective anti-anxiety and anti-depressant compound. Taking a few teaspoons mixed in water during the evenings provides at first a mild stimulation, then a relaxing, calm, happy state which persists for hours.  I find I am in a better mood, things which would normally stress me out or weigh down my mind are easily dealt with, and it is very easy for me to be creative.  I have gotten very into playing and recording music, as kratom seems to facilitate a creative, open mindset.  When sick with a cold or flu, or when suffering from any physical ailment, kratom reduces the dysphoria and body pains greatly, without the sedating numbness of opiate drugs.  \n\nThe side effects are relatively minimal compared to opiates or especially alcohol.  If taken on an empty stomach, kratom can cause gas or mild nausea, but this is easily remedied by taking it after eating.  The only other side effect I have noticed is a mild lethargy in the mornings after taking too much the night before.  Certainly nothing compared to the vicious hangovers from drinking or the crippling headaches from prescription opiate withdrawals. \n\nBased on my extensive research, there is only 1 death ever on record that can be solely attributed to kratom.  All the other deaths occurred with a combination with alcohol or other strong depressant drugs, which are surely to blame.  Given that hundreds of thousands of people in the US take kratom on a regular basis, if it was truly dangerous, even a fraction as dangerous as drugs like oxycodone or hydrocodone, surely there would have been thousands of deaths by overdose by now?  There is simply not enough evidence that kratom presents an imminent threat to our public health to justify an outright ban.  \n\nBy doing so, the DEA will be needlessly criminalizing a large segment of society and also, perhaps most damagingly, restricting future research on the medical benefits of kratom.  It is incredibly difficult for scientists to do research on schedule 1 drugs, and placing kratom in this category would be very harmful, as there is some evidence to suggest the compounds in kratom could provide a safer alternative to classic opiate treatments, and could lead to an entirely new class of painkiller drugs,which do not suppress respiratory function.\n\nI have a friend who used kratom to successfully quit heroin, and I have read hundreds of other similar stories online.  Given that our nation is in the midst of an opiate epidemic, it seems that, if the DEA truly wants to protect the American people, it would not be banning one of the most promising treatments for this addiction.  I'm not saying kratom is a cure-all, or that it should be taken by everybody.  I don't even mind if the industry is regulated, like tobacco and alcohol, and taxed accordingly.  But banning this plant outright would be truly harmful to our society, and would deprive many people of pain relief and other benefits.\n\nI sincerely hope that Kratom will remain un-scheduled in the future.  Please let the scientific community research this plant for the years to come, and see what it has to offer.\n\nThank you,\n\nX","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20696","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anyonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a lifesaver for me.

Kratom is an amazing plant that has many benefits. I have been using it on and off for about five years for pain relief and anxiety. I have a pain in my lower back that  doctors cannot figure out what it's coming from, so they prescribed me percocet  to manage the pain. Got addicted to pain pills and eventually moved to heroin when I could not find prescription pills. Got so bad on that stuff that I lost my job and my house and almost my family. I tried stopping, but the withdrawal symptoms were too much to bear. A friend introduced me to kratom, which in less than 3 weeks I was able to wean myself altogether off of opiates with the help of kratom. I have quit kratom cold turkey and the withdrawal symptoms from it are like comparing a mosquito bite (kratom) to a shark attack (heroin).  \n\n  Long story short: I have a great life, great job , a happy family, and little to no pain all thanks to kratom. Please reconsider  your scheduling of kratom. I believe that the quality should be regulated, as we don't need any more deaths from o-desmethyl  tramadol   (which is what really killed the people that kratom got blamed for).

I will be as forthright and honest as I can; please consider my point of view as I also represent many others alongside me.\n\nI have used Kratom for the past 29 months (2 years, 5 months). I use it on a daily basis. I tell only my friends and close family members, but no one would know otherwise. The only alteration it's made to my life is that I do not suffer so severely from my extreme emotional sensitivity  due to Borderline Personality Disorder. It is an Axis 2 mental health disorder, and about 10% of people with it die at their own hands; its as hopeless as it gets without treatment. Your emotions are extreme and fragile, your relationships are just the same. With it, it's near impossible to live and function normally, and I was almost at the end of my rope two and a half years ago. I have made 2 suicide attempts throughout adulthood (I am 30 years of age now). \n\nThe treatment for this disorder has no prescribed medication, and the counseling and group therapies (though they have been effective) take years to produce results. Without enough stable, disposable income to support such treatments, I was going nowhere.\n\nI was on the verge of a Vicodin addiction after a tooth infection 2 years ago, because it (for the first time since high school) took the emotional pain out of me. I could relax finally. I didn't even know what was in Vicodin, so I did research and discovered that it's a narcotic opioid that can be EXTREMELY addictive and harmful. I thank God every day that I did not fall into an addiction with it, as tempting as it was at that time. What it did though was lead me research for a safer alternative that could help me with my emotional distress and emptiness. That's when by God's grace I discovered Kratom.\n\nI was skeptical, I was nervous, and I didn't know what to expect... but I gave it a try. Here is what I have found to be true with Kratom.\n\nI know what the FDA and DEA report about the effects and dangers of Kratom, and Ive also seen the way it's reported by the media. The truth is, I have never had delusions or hallucinations, never has it caused nervousness, agitation, aggression, sleeplessness, tremors, loss of libido... never have I even had any severe withdrawal symptoms even when I go multiple days without it. Constipation is really the only side-effect I've had, but Ive found when taken in a hot-tea form it resolves this issue. I know that may sound unrealistic to you (especially given how the media portrays Kratom to be)  like surely there's more I'm not telling you, but I really am telling the truth. I am 30 years old, I live independent of my parents, have a stable job in accounting, my own apartment, car, provide for myself and am on a path to achieve the goals I have for my life... and constipation is the only side effect I've ever experienced with Kratom in 29 months.\n\nNot only has it not affected me the way the DEA and FDA say it should, but NEVER (and I mean never) has a direct death been found from Kratom use. All cases of reported deaths (as I'm sure you're aware) found numerous other substances in their system as well. And the CDC has only had one possible call of a Kratom overdose, which was not conclusive either. This is all VERY important to consider. What is the true harm here? Is there any truly, documented, known danger that Kratom causes? It's worth honestly and scientifically seeking an answer to that before reporting it to be on par with Heroin and other Schedule I drugs... is it not? Many foods can cause constipation from time to time, many foods can even produce sickness and harm your body if used irresponsibly... but there is no record that Kratom has ever seriously harmed anyone. It is an uplifting herb indeed, but in a mild, natural manner. Does this alone make it worth banning? Let it be studied and have real documented, scientific conclusions made on it before making a decision like this. Please! \n\nAs a former athlete and basketball player, I have used MANY exercise/workout supplements (such as Creatine among others) that have had far worse and more negative side effects, especially to my digestive system, than I've ever experienced from Kratom. But nothing I've ever tried has been THIS BENEFICIAL to my life overall. It can be such a blessing, and I -- just like you -- would like to see something this valuable used responsibly.

In addition, researchers believe kratom could potentially be used to create safe supplements for mild pain.\n\nScientists have indicated, however, that if kratom becomes a Schedule I substance then it will be almost impossible for researchers to study any potential benefits. People who currently drink kratom tea will no longer be able to enjoy the benefits of the herbal supplement and it will become a felony for Americans to own a mildly uplifting tea. \n\nThousands of Americans from across the country have come together in an unprecedented way in order to request that kratom does not become a scheduled substance and instead remains legal; a White House petition requesting that kratom remain legal garnered over 100,000 signatures and kratom rallies were covered by news outlets such as NPR and Forbes.\n\nReporting by the Washington Spectator outlined why making kratom a scheduled substance would be the wrong policy. In their reporting, the Washington Spectator noted that: \"Making kratom a 'controlled substance' could impede future research. Vradi notes that if kratom is restricted 'it will make it much more difficult to obtain large enough amounts of the plant product . . . scientists will have to obtain a Schedule I license and go through multiple administrative steps to obtain kratom and its alkaloids for their research needs. The decision may also hinder future clinical studies that would look at the effects and safety of kratom in humans.' \n\nThe Washington Spectator's full reporting can be found here: https://washingtonspectator.org/tea-action-kratom/\n\nNo deaths have ever been directly connected to kratom. Centers for Disease Control centers received substantially more calls about laundry detergent pods than kratom in 2015 and 2016. Energy drinks kill multiple people each year; kratom has killed zero people throughout its decades-long history of use in the United States. \n\nPerhaps kratom should be regulated in a way that requires clearer labeling and better quality control standards. But making a safe herbal supplement like kratom a scheduled substance will impede research, harm consumers, adversely effect public health in America, and will set a dangerous precedent. Given the unnecessary harm that would be caused to American consumers if kratom were to become a scheduled substance, I urge the Drug Enforcement Administration to reconsider their proposed rule and instead allow kratom to remain freely available to Americans as a legal herbal supplement.

I'm writing this in full support of my daughter, who has uses kratom for the last year. She takes prescription pain medication, provided through her pain management doctors since the age of 17. She is now 36, and was concerned that she would spend the rest of her life taking high doses of dangerous medication. I have watched her over the last 15 -20 years slowly deteriorate, and lose her love of life. Her pain was so bad many days, she stayed indoors while others in the family, or her friends went on exciting trips, or basic functions. She was no longer able to participate in even simple tasks. She had not had a job in almost 6 years, sue to her inability to stand or lift anything. She did a lot of research into supplements that might help her, and found kratom. She didn't want to totally stop her pain meds, as they did help her to a degree, she wanted to add the kratom to what she was taking, and see if she felt better. Its been a complete change in her life. She's happy again! She sleeps! She seems so clear, and focused again. I can honestly say as a loving parent I have my child back! Adding the kratom to her prescription drug routine has helped her tremendously. I'm begging you to keep this option open for her. Don't take away the life she's tried so hard to regain. She's able to work a art time job now, and is a loving mother and wife. Please keep kratom legal..

I take a few grams throughout the day. And the past few months have been clear and good for me! I've been prescribed with severe general anxiety and social anxiety which has caused me to lose weight profusely and not feel as good as I used too. The doctors think the anxiety was triggered from my father dying from cancer within a couple weeks of us founding out he had it.  So the doctors started prescribing me all sorts of this and that, SSRI's, alprazolam, klonzapam.. the best one that worked for me was the xanax (alprazolam). Until I found kratom.. I tried marijuana but it didn't help too much other than with sleeping and eating. But when I started taking kratom, I didn't have to take my xanax except for every once in awhile. I stopped marijuana completely and started gaining weight. Kratom has helped me eat, I sleep fine, but most importantly it helps me talk and feel comfortable with myself and others. I'm not profusely sweating or shaking or feeling like I have an empty stomach. It's amazing how this herb can cut out my anxiety like it's no problem! I love it! I wake up, take my kratom and get my coffee (which I can't normally drink because it counteracts the xanax and increases anxiety)  and start my day without problems. I haven't noticed one single negative side effect from using kratom these past few months. If anything I've recommended it. I plea that you actually read these reviews/comments and understand that each one of us using kratom have a reason or rhyme behind it. Save kratom and save people like me.

Most who know me know I have suffered with severe pain for 3/4 of my life. I recently came across some information on a plant called Kratom. I spent four months researching everything about it. When you live with severe chronic pain the way I do, you are willing to try anything and everything to help you feel as close to \"normal\" as possible! For many years I have felt like nothing more than a pincushion with a delusional hope of being even half the person I used to be. With appointment after appointment. Scan after scan. Surgery after surgery (including a spinal neurostimulator that is supposed to help reduce my pain and doesn't). Injection after injection. Pill after pill. So many, I have become quite a pharmacist without a degree! Not that I've ever asked to be one or even had a liking for pills of any kind! I've never been the type to enjoy taking anything at all. I remember a time I would struggle with a headache just to avoid taking an asprin. Little did I know... taking pills would be my life. The unpleasant side effects of Pharmaceuticals are something you can only understand if you've been subjected to them as your only option to relief for an extended period of time.. all of which are horrible! Little did I know that my suffering could have ended a long time ago by drinking an all natural tea called Kratom. I am on month two of my Kratom journey and my body hasn't felt this good in a very very long time! When taking my regular meds, if you were to ask me what my pain level is my answer normally is anywhere from a seven to plus ten! However, here I am on month two of Kratom tea and my pain level has been NO more than a four....which to me is almost INVISIBLE! I have taken zero meds and have experienced NO withdrawls from dropping them either!!! UNBELIEVABLE to think that I am finally going to get the life I worked so hard for back! I honestly never thought I would as my condition (DDD) only gets worse and worse. I am still in shock and my emotions have been a complete Rollercoaster. I have been stuck between crying because I can't believe how great I feel...and unspeakable anger because our society allows people like me to suffer while making big Pharma richer and richer with no real pain relief for patients! Anger because I finally found something Natural that ACTUALLY WORKS and the FDA/DEA wants to take it away from us!!! Something so harmless in comparison to all the pharmaceuticals ever prescribed to me. The same pharmacuticals that have destroyed my stomach, intestines, gallbladder and liver to name a few. I have gone to extents that NO person should have to....just to find one single ounce of relief so that I can just be a mom, a woman... who can wash her own dishes, make dinner and care for her children. My journey has been unbelievably dark and full of more suffering than any one person should ever be forced to endure! Pain takes over my entire mind, body and soul regardless of how hard I fight! It changes you and makes you feel lost and worthless because you aren't the same person anymore. Many, many times I have contemplated my existence and lost any and all hope for a functional future. Suicide has danced through my mind way too often over the years. I honestly never thought I could feel \"ok\" again until Kratom gave me my life back! \nI am begging you to leave Kratom alone! Us chronic pain patients have had things shoved down our throats for years...let us drink our tea in peace. Please do not ban this harmless plant. The facts are there...the evidence that (pure) kratom is safe and works wonders is there. Don't we suffer enough already? Opiates/pills are horrible and they are the problem not kratom!!

My father was a brave and strong man who never looked at his life as a struggle. But while he had sciatic pain in his back he turns to Oxycontin from his doctor as a relief. After 6 months of Oxycontin use he took his life. After autopsy it is known that he had a dangerous level of Oxycontin in his system. I don't blame the doctors for prescribing this to him. The system now and the drugs that are available to people with constant pain are not sufficient. Due to addiction and harmful side effects this cannot be our only option. I believe that more studies need to be performed on Creative because it could be a perfect replacement for all these harmful drugs. Nobody should lose a family member from something that is legal and prescribed by doctors for every day pain that can easily be subsided by something natural. This should not be illegal until deemed Dangerous by multiple studies. We cannot simply write this off because you want more people to buy dangerous pills and get addicted.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17414","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"brigit floriano","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps many people, such as myself, and it is not a street drug or an abusive substance.

The idea to try it came from my husband, who'd been using it himself to aid with stress and energy for approximately 5 years prior to that. Work and life in general has been incredibly stressful lately, so luckily I find kratom to be very effective at calming the anxiety that comes with the territory. All it takes is a few capsules to put me in a calm state of mind where my heart is no longer racing, head stops pounding, and my blood pressure is stable. \n\nI don't use any other drugs, and the side effects of some of the prescription drugs that would likley be recommended for someone in my situation are scary to say the least. While I only use kratom occasionally, probably a couple times a month, it's something I'd like to keep handy. It works very well and from what I've been able to tell, has a safe usage profile. The thought of something so helpful and harmless being placed in the same category as dangerous schedule 1 drugs is mind boggling to me. Just wanted to give my thoughts on the matter.

I have been taking Kratom for almost 10 yrs now and never have I hallucinated, overdosed, or been 'high'. I had a tumor removed 15 yrs ago. During the surgery a something was damaged and after that I woke up paralyzed for a few days.When I was able to feel anything again I was constantly in pain. Due to that I had to depend on prescription pain meds to be able to function day to day. I lived in a pain med induced haze. I would nod off at all times, I couldn't drive my children to their activities because of the meds and I lived in fear of an accidental overdose. I was terrified my kids would find me dead  in the morning before school or when they came home from school. Since the day  I decided to try Kratom my life has changed. I know longer doze off, no longer fear going to sleep, I can drive a car now and not worry about passing out! I participate in my kids lives and I am back to being a normal happy wife and mom.I take Kratom twice a day and now I am a functioning member of society ! Taking Kratom away from me would devastate me and my family. Cost wise we saved money because I no longer have to pay constantly to see a pain dr. at a clinic and as long as I see my reg dr every 3 months(who knows I take kratom) I am good. Banning Kratom would send me back into a horrible life. I know I will always need something so I can function daily with the nerve pain but forcing me to take a dr prescribed pill with so many horrible side effects when there is a natural herb that helps me and so many many others is wrong. We as citizens should have that choice. I read that MS is number 3 or 5 with opioid addiction. I can imagine how it will go up if Kratom is taken away. I have never ever known or heard of anyone dying from Kratom alone or feeling 'high'. A person can mix anything and die but that doesn't make each thing alone something that should be banned. There is not an issue here of young children using it and although some might abuse it I know the stats are far less worse than that of heroin and pain meds.Kratom is used for withdrawals from those 2 things too. Taking Kratom away from the general public because pharmaceutical companies want their share isn't right. Money should not be more important that anyone's life in America and this is what this fight feels like. Banning it will not stop the sell of it or people from using it. It will just make many Mom,dads,people  from all walks of life criminals because we choose to take something that saved us from a life of addiction. Pushing someone like me back into a life of pain pill usage when I see so much on the news how the opioid usage is a huge problem. Doesn't make any sense at all. The time and effort spent on trying to make Kratom illegal should be spent on the real problem with is opioid and heroin addiction. Especially when so many feel that our representatives in Washington are NOT listening to us or even care about us. The almighty dollar seems to rule there and our choice NOT take or depend on opioids is being taken away because of someone upset they are losing money or see Kratom as something they can take an alter to turn around and prescribe us. If there more research wanting to be done then leave Kratom alone until there is something that says we shouldn't take. Its been around for so long and if you look at the real stats there is no reason it should be banned or put into any schedule. I can think of many other things sold over the counter that are known to do damage but because those things aren't taking away from the pharmaceutical companies and shareholder they are left alone. Where is the justification in that?

I was first introduced to kratom two years ago by one of my employees, who had been using the herb to help offset his back pain and sore muscles. I'd recently undergone a spinal surgery myself, and decided to try kratom to see if it would help with my general soreness. I was pleased to discover that not only was it quite helpful with alleviating my pain, but it also provided me with an additional energy boost that was very similar to an excellent cup (or two) of coffee. It's wonderful!\n\nSince I discovered kratom, I've found that it's been extremely beneficial for both my personal and professional life. As a person with chronic back problems who works a job that requires 8+ hours a day of sitting, its pain-reducing qualities are a life saver. I also find that kratom helps keep my energy and focus sharp, which is incredibly useful in my high-stress profession.\n\nAs an executive who certainly would NOT consider using illegal drugs, I admit that I was baffled (and a little insulted) when I read that the DEA was considering scheduling the herb as a controlled substance.  I've been using kratom daily for years, and have never experienced any side-effects from the herb -- no dependencies or negative effects. \n\nI'd be extremely disappointed if I'm no longer able to enjoy kratom, and ask that you reconsider your position on the matter of scheduling it as a controlled substance. From my personal experience and the experience of many other individuals I know, kratom is a highly beneficial plant that positively affects lives. Treating it otherwise would be a huge misstep, and would negatively impact the thousands of Americans currently enjoying its benefits.\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nEmily","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16601","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Emily Diehl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I would just like to add my comment in support of keeping Kratom off of the scheduled regulation. I have been regularly  using Kratom for about 3yrs after becoming physically dependent on dangerous opiates from treating chronic pain. Since I have been maintaining on Kratom I am no longer dependent on any medications. In fact I believe Kratom is more effective at treating the pain and I am able to use it only as needed. In between doses, even days or weeks at a time without the Kratom, I experience ZERO withdrawal symptoms. I have also lost weight and been able to maintain better overall health, I do not experience any negative side effects such as constipation like I was with the opiates. I really believe that Kratom has helped my life dramatically and could also help others. Since it does not create respiratory depression I feel it is a safer alternative to opiates plus I don't feel the intoxication or compulsive desire to seek out more Kratom. Of course I am not a medical professional but I think instead of immediately scheduling this plant that has done wonders for myself and so many others, it would benefit from at least postponing the scheduling until further research has been done.

I would struggle daily if not for kratom.  I take breaks for several days at a time and do not suffer severe withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal is similar to caffeine withdrawal.  I do not want to take prescription drugs. Please do not ban kratom. It is helping so many live fuller lives!

I had a heart attack at the age of 19 and was implanted with a pacemaker. I was left with terrible anxiety and was given benzodiazepines to alieviate my symptoms. I was on this medication for 8 years, and I had also started drinking alcohol along with it to simply calm myself down. My life was in shambles by the end of it. I had lost my job, and was feeling so anxious every day that I wanted to end my life... then my boyfriend had read about Kratom on a website for natural healing, and he ordered some for me. When I got it, I wasn't sure about it, but tried it anyway.... what did I have to lose. Within the first week, I was able to stop drinking having been taking Kratom. Within a month I was able to stop taking the benzodiazepines. I have been using Kratom for almost 6 years. It saved my life. I am a fully functioning human being, a great and hard working citizen. Please hear our voice, we need this plant, it has helped millions of people. I have never gotten sick from it, I have always used it responsibly.... but even the people who took a lot of it, they never went to the ER, they were fine. I have taken large doses of this plant, and I have never had anything bad happen to me, so I do hope we can keep this for the public... it has healed my anxiety, I haven't drank in over 5 years.... and I am incredibly happy now.

It helps to alleviate the constant headaches and it helps nullify some of the symptoms of 24/7 vertigo. I have been using Kratom for the last three years. Before kratom I would find myself taking the pain medication my doctor prescribed to me to help with the headaches but, they would make the vertigo worse. I implore you to strongly take a deep look into the facts and see that kratom is not a public health nuisance as was originally thought but, a truly beneficial plant that helps hundreds of thousands of Americans lead normal productive lives. We come from all walks of life and everyone has a story.  Please listen to us and realize the majority of us are hard working, everyday people, that have found a natural solution to a myriad of ailments.

Indeed, given the current epidemic of opiate abuse/addiction and fatal overdose, it would seem that Kratom, which has been in use in SE Asia for hundreds of years, both medicinally and recreationally. Putting Kratom into schedule 1, even temporarily, will do nothing except increase adulteration on the black market, and importation will morph to smuggling, with the potential for violence, and increasing the burden on law enforcement and our judicial system. It would be a far greater service to public health to simply quietly study the existing situation, and then make recommendations as to how to make this plant medicine available to individuals for whom it may be appropriate, discover what risks exist for those who use it recreationally, and educating the public about such risks. \nsincerely,\nDwight L.

Although I have not applied for disability, the pain I live with is a factor in my having stopped looking for work. I do not use illegal drugs of any kind.  I began using kratom in June of this year for back and fibromyalgia pain. I stopped using it on September 30 when it became a Schedule I drug. \n\nKratom is especially helpful for my fibromyalgia flare-ups. It reduces the achiness and burning feeling in my body by at least 50%, and sometimes more. I use 1-2 teaspoons (I estimate 4-9 grams) of the powdered leaves (usually red bali) as needed with water and 500 mg. acetaminophen.  I am on Cymbalta and Neurontin and an NSAID, yet I still have frequent episodes of intractable pain. \n\nKratom provides superb relief from pain. While using it, I also became aware that it was very good at lowering my anxiety, which goes hand in hand with my pain. I have had some terrible side effects from \"approved\" anxiety medications.  Kratom is very gentle compared to these other meds. \n\nI believe kratom can be overused. I cannot speak for others, but in my own case the most serious result of overuse is that I will develop a tolerance and I will need to take more of it for the same level of pain relief. Many times, I will skip kratom when I am in a lot of pain because I don't want to take it so often that its effect will be reduced.  In my opinion, one of the most important areas scientists can research is finding a way to keep this tolerance from happening, so that patients can get the same level of relief each time they use it.  If this could be accomplished, over-use of Kratom would unlikely be  a result for those who use it for pain.\n\nAlthough kratom did lift my mood, I did not consider this being \"high.\" From my viewpoint, kratom's analgesic effect is much more impressive than its ability to create the \"mellow\" feeling I sometimes feel.  I have never taken more than 20 grams in one day. (I am aware that preparations of the leaves can vary, but I always use the same provider which probably minimizes this).\n\nI hope that a way can be found for kratom to be available for the sake of compassion to all of us who need safe ways to deal with our pain. And the same for those who wish to get off much more dangerous addictions. Currently, I obtain kratom online from a provider that I believe to be very trustworthy and honest about how they obtain and prepare kratom for their customers.\n \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0571","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ana Arellano","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello DEA,\n\nPeople stuck using pharmaceuticals narcotics and illegal drugs that want to get out of their condition, but still needs that one thing that the drug gives them to live a normal life.

Every time the \"safe\" and mild solutions are such as kratom are no longer an option, you push decent people no other choice but what they can get cheaply on the streets, or at the local drug store.  Kratom has about as mild of effect on someone as anything I, or anyone else I talked to, than anything else out there.  I can tell you, if you ban this non-public threatening plant, I can tell you you will have millions more people driving up the risk of the drug and pharmaceutical illegal trades, driving up crime, more human rights violations in countries that supply the US, which I think you agency knows very well.

I have used Kratom daily for the past two years and it has literally helped me turn my life around. I've been battling major anxiety and panic attacks for more than 15 years, and have been clinically diagnosed with PTSD. And like many who suffer from PTSD, I turned to alcohol to cope/mask the symptoms. It was a losing battle and after 10 years of worsening alcoholism, my physical and mental health were on the fritz. I was also having problems in my personal relationships and at work.  \n\nI found Kratom on an anxiety forum and decided to give it a shot. Surprisingly, I found that not only did it help me manage my anxiety, it curbed my cravings for both alcohol and harder drugs. After a short time, I was stunned to realize I hadn't had a drink in a week. Weeks turned in to months, and months turned into a year. During that time, I've gotten promoted at work and welcomed my first child into the world. I had tried and failed to quit drinking so many times, but the PTSD and anxiety always drove me back. It was miserable. Alcoholism kills so many and I had honestly become resigned to that fate. In addition to regular therapy, Kratom has given me my life back.\n \nI know I'm not alone, and many others have had success with Kratom in turning their lives around from dangerous substance abuse problems. It has also provided a real alternative for those who want to avoid powerful prescription narcotics.

Because there were no reports because simply put they are not the same thing, I doubt you never got even 1 plea from anyone saying please dont ban bathsalts as they will negatively impact my health and the health of our country.\nAnd as for the negative inpacts the 15,000 plus people that are asking that you not ban kratom should speak for itself, how many deaths from kratom in this period, 0. How many from opioids ,72..a day. And this is only one aspect of the people it helps. 22  veterans a day commit suicide from ptsd issues , not to mention childhood trauma survivors with ptsd.

A friend of mine introduced it to me when I mentioned how I was having issues with anxiety that were making it difficult for me to be able to go to work. Since I have started taking kratom, it has had an incredibly positive impact on my life.\n\nI've found kratom to be very helpful in reducing my symptoms related to anxiety and also depression.\n\nOne of the major benefits that I've noticed is that I can take it as needed instead of having to take it every day. I've had times where I've taken it daily for a few months. But there's also been times where I don't feel any need to take except for a few times over the course of several months. At those times when I did stop taking it, I didn't experience any side effects that made stopping difficult. Perhaps a headache, but it's hard to be certain if it was even related since I've always been someone who gets lots of headaches.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, kratom helps me at times when my anxiety feels overwhelming. It helps calm and relax me but it doesn't make me tired or disoriented. I need to focus and pay particular attention to details while on the job, and kratom doesn't reduce my ability to focus or concentrate, which is really fantastic.\n\nAs far as helping with depression, kratom does an amazing job at elevating my mood. I can literally feel the empty, hopeless feelings caused by depression evaporate when I take kratom. I feel like myself again and I can move forward in my life as a productive member of society.\n\nAnyone who has suffered from anxiety or depression will know how difficult it can be. The help that kratom provides to those who suffer from anxiety and depression, is nothing short of a miracle for us, especially since kratom is a dietary supplement, it's NOT addictive, and it's NOT a drug!\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20932","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban kratom.

Kratom needs to be treated like alcohol: regulated and taxed, with an age limit to purchase/consume. Kratom is a godsend for me, personally, as I suffer from chronic neck and back pain caused by cervical dystonia. Without any medication, the pain is excruciating and most OTC pain relievers do NOTHING to alleviate this. I have also suffered from anxiety and depression from a young age, and Kratom helps me with these as well. It keeps me relaxed and helps me sleep at night. It is a natural alternative to many pharmaceutical opiates that DO harm people. This substance has helped thousands stay away from those prescription pharmaceuticals that ARE dangerous and, as of this moment, Kratom has never been instigated as the cause of a death via overdose when it was not mixed with various other drugs, proving that it is much safer than alcohol. I know of many ELDERLY patients who are PRESCRIBED Kratom for various reasons, and it vastly improves their quality of life. If you are going to keep dangerous carcinogens and poisons like alcohol and tobacco legal, it would be grossly unjust to place a safe substance like Kratom in the most harshly treated category of drugs. If you keep performing 'emergency' acts like this to 'help' people, you will only continue to lose face as you reveal your ulterior motives and lack of concern for all the people this substance is helping. The 'War On Drugs' needs to end, as it is clearly not helping anyone who does drugs by treating them like criminals. If you really want to end this war, which it seems like you don't, you must decriminalize drugs and regulate them. Doing this would immediately devastate any illegal drug operations as there is simply no reason to go through them when you can legally acquire a drug and know, really KNOW, what you are getting while paying less in the process. The biggest reason that many of these drugs are so harmful is that people are acquiring 'street' versions that are often mixed with substances that are incredibly harmful on their own, not to mention that they are barely informed about the drug itself. If you would only regulate these drugs, instead of letting criminals have their way, the drug empire would collapse and we could release a great many innocent people from prison. With a doctor's supervision and INFORMATION about what they would be taking, the amount of overdoses would be staggeringly lower than it is now. But, it seems the only reason this hasn't already been done is because the government directly benefits from this, the biggest scam in the last thousand years at least. Please, consider the citizens of the planet for once, and realize that this is only hurting everyone. As long as you continue to abuse your power to ban substances uncontested, which is already in violation of our First Amendment rights, people will continue to suffer at your hands.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18382","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Miranda","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been addicted to opiates and also alcohol in the past.

The biggest positive I can relay to you is the energy boost and slight mood elevation I get after taking it first thing in the morning, its really the best way to get my day going. The biggest negative I've experienced with it is sporadic constipation, but I cant attribute that to the kratom 100%. I feel that the kratom ban would be a step in the wrong direction that could end up scarring this country in some of the same ways alcohol and marijuana prohibition has done. I feel a better move would be to keep kratom legal and maybe even tax it, and use the tax money to help addicts who need it. There are plenty of other problem substances that could use addressing.

In August of 2003 While employed by the City of Cedar Park I sustained a L5 Crush Fracture. This as you may no doubt guess was incredibly painful. The City was quick to protect themselves from any long term responsibility such as long term care and rehab. I underwent MANY treatments and procedures to alleviate my suffering. NON was effective. I was then introduced to Norco and Oxycontin. I was taking over 300 10mg Norco (Hydrocodone) as well as 80 Oxycontin's every month. Later I lost my employment as well as my health care. I was completely hooked on those pills. I did everything to get them. I tried to stop taking them, even went through a long and painful De-Tox. The pain just wouldn't leave me in peace. My doctor told me about kratom and I tried it. That was in 2009. Since then I have been A: Gainfully employed, B: Drug AND Alcohol free, C: HAPPY!! I have not had ONE negative side effect from Kratom. PLEASE PLEASE don't take this wonderful plant away from me and others like me who suffer each and everyday of our lives.

I would like to express my opposition to the schedulingn of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (AKA \"Kratom\"). I have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a painful and debilitating, inherited condition. There is no cure for my illness and I have struggled to manage the symptoms throughout my life. About a year ago, Kratom was recommended to me as a possible treatment for pain and other ailments. It allowed me to begin living my life again without strong and addictive controlled substances. Kratom is not any more addictive than caffeine, and I can say from personal experience that using Kratom regularly does not lead to tolderance or a need for increased amounts. It also does not produce a \"high\" like prescription painkillers. Kratom has a mild, relaxing effect that is similar to drinking chamomile tea. Restricting Kratom will undoubtedly block patients with real health concerns from finding alternative treatments to opioids, including myself. Kratom has allowed me to work full-time, care for my child, and function in society. Please do not add the only thing that has truly helped my disorder to the controlled substance list.\n\nThank you,\nLaura","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13469","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was recently diagnose with fibromyalgia. \nI also have chronic migraines. \nI've had to quit my job because I am no longer able to complete normal tasks.

If these people did choose to go to doctor they will get prescription for a lethal addictive drug. Once on these drugs it's hard to come off. Some then choose cheap alternative and this cycle grows as populations grow. Never ever to end no matter how many you lock up or send to rehab. I was one of these. Stealing lying and in a endless circle. Until I decided enough and googled alternative to end addiction. Kratom I found and saved my life.

I had severe migraine headaches for about twenty-five years and I would use Imitrex injections and prescription painkillers every day. In 2007, I suffered a heart attack. I was in a downward spiral from heavy medicine use. \nI decided to try Kratom with the hopes of replacing the prescription painkillers that were destroying my work and family life. I was able to stop taking all prescription pain medication immediately. The cycle of rebound migraine headaches caused by vaso-constrictors was broken with daily kratom use and I was able to stop taking the expensive Imitrex injections and pills. \nNow, six years later, I am in perfect health. Yesterday, my blood pressure was 106/70 which is the best its been in years. My doctor is amazed that I have been able to recover so quickly from heart disease and the debilitating effects of PTSD. She has instructed me to continue doing what I am doing even though she knows very little about Kratom.\nI have been able to live a healthy and happy life and be the provider my family needs because of my daily kratom supplement use. In 2007 my heart surgeon told me I would be lucky to live ten more years at the rate I was going. It is almost ten years later now and I am enjoying excellent health. I work as a technician for the company Redbox in the day. At night I work for Scholastic book fairs preparing learning materials for childrens school book fairs. I am able to be the husband, father and provider that I was meant to be. \nI live in fear of having to return to the medications that almost destroyed me though.

For 4 years, I was an opiate addict who's opiate addiction eventually turned into a heroin and cocaine addiction. I tried going to rehab, used the first day I got out. The only reason I'm alive and not dead or in prison right now is because of kratom. In the past, I would do anything to get my fix. Steal, lie,  and drive hours just to fill that void in my life.

Sure, I think about them from time to time,but giving them serious consideration is just stupid. I don't have these thoughts because I have kratom. It is cheap, legal, and virtually harmless. If it were to be made illegal I don't believe that I would continue using it, but it does worry me that if I started getting opiate cravings again that I would give in and buy some opiates. I believe I will eventually quit kratom, but right now I don't see the need to. I live a completely normal life and it does not interfere with it, if anything it helps it. But when I do quit, I want it to be on my own terms and not because the DEA considers me to be a criminal.

I spent years with doctors, pain clinics, etc., with no real results except losing all my teeth from the narcotics they were feeding me. On December 20, 2001, I had enough and stopped a 7 year morphine addiction cold turkey. The doctors were fine with the addiction, I was not. I started taking the max dosage of ibuprofen to deal with my pain, but over years of taking it, the otc meds weren't doing anything but messing up my digestive system. I did some research to find something natural to help me, and found kratom. It's been a little over a year since I started drinking the tea, and I have never felt better. To say it's addictive is just a lie. To say it's killed anyone is just a lie. It is a natural herb in the coffee family that's been used for a long time in other parts of the world. I am a successful business owner with a daughter in college. To see what the DEA and the government are doing really opens my eyes to the fact that their actions are driven by money that pharmaceutical companies stand to lose. Nothing more, nothing less. I am for regulation of purity and age restrictions on the sale of herbal supplements, but other than that, the DEA needs to keep their nose out of law abiding tax payers business. Is this still the United States of America?

It is probable that this reaction is part of an evolutionary response to protect us from the many dangers that afflicted us when humanity was at the whim of our environment.  I feel this tendency still persist today when unknown substances or subjects enter into the spotlight.  We hear stories from the media, friends, and the government about how harmful or beneficial a substance maybe.  It can truly be tough to discern the truth from the fiction.  I had this fearful evolutionary response when first hearing about Kratom.  What is it? What can it do?  What are its effects?  Is it harmful?  However, I also was positively intrigued by it.  How can this help individuals afflicted by a condition or disease; either painful, emotional, or mental?  Is there a beneficial use that some people might get from it?  My curiosity was raised after listening to Chris Bell speak about his experience with it on the JRE podcast.  He raises a lot of good points about the pros/cons and the misinformation that exists out there.  As a person who believes in the freedom to choose, I believe the DEA should not legal Kratom or any other drug as schedule 1.  It completely limits any possibility of good that could come out of legitimate scientific work.  Look whats being down with MDMA by John Hopkins and Maps.  If the DEA is a responsible organization looking out for the welfare of the American Public it is their place to go after the pushers that would do us harm.  However, it is also their responsibility to allow us to make our own informed decisions.  American Citizens can not do this if Kratom is labeled a schedule 1 drug.  The DEA should do whatever is necessary to ensure scientific research can be conducted tstudy the efficacy of Kratom.  While those studies are being conducted the DEA should also respect a Citizens right to freely choose.  People who have \"allegedly\" died from Kratom use could have had different chemical makeups from users who have not died.  This is currently a problem for \"legal\" drugs that one can by over the counter or be prescribed by a doctor.  Medical science can not simply account for the limitless ways medication will affect a person.  Chris Bell's stories, if they are true, show that individuals that need medication can safely and responsibly take krater without negative, harmful, or even deadly consequences.

I do like the effects, but I do not feel the type of craving I do with, for example, caffeine (and I definitely feel withdrawal from if I go without coffee!).  I exercise regularly and lead a healthy lifestyle; at no point have I ever felt this plant weigh me down or reduce my energy level.  \n\nIt is true that I would be disappointed if this plant, which has given me some relief and no perceivable negative side effects, became suddenly unavailable to me.

And I have recently seen video testimony of military veterans with PTSD who have found solace in this dried plant.  I find this notion even more troubling: as a society we would be condemning these brave people, who put their bodies on the line to defend this country, by denying them the freedom to ingest a natural substance that lets them find peace and relief from the pain of trauma.\n\nPlease do not ban this plant.

I work for a laboratory in the organ procurement organization, and I take what I do seriously. This is because I take my life seriously, in every way possible. Oftentimes I feel too mature for my age by taking full responsibility for who I am as a person and for every action I make. I do the best that I can do every day at work because I like to work hard and earn my right to relax and to enjoy my life. Oftentimes I will strain myself mentally and physically to get the job done, and done right. I take pride in hard work, but not many do. So I tend to find myself working for more people than myself. This leads to excessive mental fatigue/ stress and physical stress and tension in my muscles and joints. I found out about kratom some time ago and found it to be extremely beneficial for both, physical and mental stress, that I tend to put on myself. I like the idea that nature provides a plant that remedies my work-related stress. It has been an absolute pleasure to discover and use this plant for physical and mental stress. I have also used this for pain management in other ways. One other benefit I have discovered, is that it helps me when I am sick. The kind of sick where you have a fever, body aches, nose is a faucet, stomach is unhappy, and your brain feels the pain of everything in the body and usually has unpleasant thoughts. I would take kratom amidst the pain and nausea, an hour or so later, I feel pleasantly uplifted, nose slows down on mucus, and my body aches are tolerable. I felt like I cheated. Being sick is supposed to be terrible, but kratom made it beyond tolerable. I felt so good I could work. I have done this every time I am sick or full of mucus and it always makes me feel like everything will be ok. Even though I feel like I am dying sometimes, or wanting to die. I have also used kratom for other physical pain like bruising, muscle cramps, extreme soreness from working out, any any kind of pain that I put myself through. I have also used it for social anxiety and depression with great benefit as well. Before I end this, I would like to briefly mention that I do not use kratom regularly for \"fun\". I only use it when I feel burdened with stress in its array of forms and triggers. It has done wonders for me as a \"plant medicine\". It would be very sad to see such a beneficial plant become illegal. I can handle pain, anxiety, and depression, but if there is a plant that can help, why would someone ban my right to nature? Why would someone deny access to these benefits? What is being accomplished by denying rights to a leaf? Why do I feel like crying over a plant that has helped me more than any other medicine?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean West","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nKratom has helped me maintain a less chemical FEEL to living with ADHD.

Their lives could have been saved by this benign substance. \n\nPlease keep kratom available for us responsible users.\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6220","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph Bradley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The transparency under which the DEA is operating these days is very high.\nBanning a plant like Kratom with zero evidence of danger is a play to the pharma industry since this plant helps save people from addiction, which claims the lives of someone every 19 minutes.  The fact that the DEA considered to remove pot from Schedule 1 but chose not to means you ignored the overwhelming evidence of both medical benefit and zero recreational harm.\n\nThanks to the internet, the DEA can no longer hide their shady practices.\nIt is clear to everyone the following:\n1. The DEA is not out to protect citizens\n2. Does not care about science and evidence when making drug policy\n3.  Was founded on political maneuvering and still operates that way to this day.\n\nAs for the \"15 deaths\" from Kratom, 14 had waaaaay stronger pharma in their system and the last was a suicide who was also withdrawing from other drugs.\n\nScientific evidence that Kratom is illegal?  Hardly, but hey, when has that ever stopped the DEA?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13245","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"mike carlton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"}],"totalNumRecords":23226}
