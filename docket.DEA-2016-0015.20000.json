I read about Kratom 8 months ago when trying to find an alternative to Tramadol. After consuming Kratom, in its powder form, as it should be, natural and wholesome, I experienced pain relief without the side effects of medication: no foggy head, no dependency issues. It is affordable and works wonders! Because it is natural and a plant that does not suppress my breathing, I am not worried about any risks of overdosing and dying. PLEASE let me continue to consume this natural plant leaf, as it does not cause harm to me, nor my family (as an opioid medication possibly could). I am fully on disability due to my debilitating disease and I really need this herbal remedy for pain relief! I appreciate your departments' concern in public safety, but this plant has medical benefits and is NOT addictive! I do NOT want to have to depend on big pharma medication, as it IS addictive and expensive.\nPlease let me keep my Kratom! Do not schedule it like heroin, because it is NOT a drug!\n \nThank you,\nLisa E.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0893","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa E","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my aunts life.

I have been using kratom medicinally for the last year and the only negative side effect I have found is nausea. The nausea can be quite intense if you take too much, but normally it is very mild, does not last too long and is fixed with time and food\n\nI have a herniated disc at C6-C7 and a bulging disc at C4-C5. As one can imagine, the pain can be very distracting, debilitating and chronic. I've been on a slow climb upwards towards healing and Kratom has assisted me greatly. I only take Kratom when I really need it for the pain. I do not take it every night. When my neck does flare up, Kratom can quite literally be a godsend. Certain strains can eliminate my pain for 3-4 hours and make me feel much less ruminative and anxious about the state of my neck. It makes me feel so much less obsessive about the pain in my neck and being able to experience that for even a short amount of time is really wonderful and helps me to be productive. \n\nI am not the only one who uses Kratom medicinally. There are thousands of us whose quality of life could dip considerably in certain ways if Kratom were to be banned. Kratom is not dangerous.

I have had severe back pain due to degenerative disc disease for most of my life (diagnosed in 2014).   I underwent several procedures on my back in order to alleviate the pain, which got worse after having radiofrequency ablation (to burn the nerve endings in my last three vertebrae).  The medications that I was given to help the pain only made me sleepy...and since I am a teacher, I couldn't afford the risk o side effects interfering with my career.\n\nThere are no words to express how grateful I am to have found kratom.  While it does not completely take away the pain, it reduces the pain and inflammation to a point where I can go about my normal life without the severe discomfort in my back.\n\nI am deeply concerned that kratom could become a Schedule 1 \"drug.\"  The closest supplement I can compare kratom to is Kava, which can be purchased at nearly every grocery store in the vitamins aisle.   I cannot imagine going right back to living with chronic pain every day - having the pain interfere with the career I love so much and some days being in so much discomfort that I have to go back to getting Toradol injections in my hips.\n\nPlease consider an alternative of *regulating* kratom instead of making it an automatic felony.  There are so many people besides myself that use it for pain management.  Please consider allowing kratom to be studied...there are so many people who use it on a daily basis for pain management as there is such a huge opiate addiction problem in our country. \n\nThank you so much for your time & consideration.  \nRebecca L.

Essentially, it causes massive back pains that has recently grown to shooting pain down my right leg as well.  I have been prescribed high amounts of pain killers for this, but I don't like how they feel.  Yes they do the job, but they're very harsh on my body.  Once I found Kratom, that all changed.  \n\nKratom gives me all the pain relief of prescription pills without the side effects.  It is 100% safer and more effective for my pain.  I am a much happier and more productive person now that I have drastically reduced the amount of pills I need to take.  For many people, pills are also very easy to become addicted to.  I have never felt that way with Kratom.  \n\nI have read studies also that show this can and has helped people stop using Heroin.  For that reason alone, I think this plant must remain legal.  It is my personal belief that if this plant becomes illegal, many people that have quit heroin with this method will now go back to it (or pills) and we will see a massive increase of overdoses and deaths.  From what I've read, the few deaths associated with Kratom were almost always involving other drugs as well, and therefore it can't conclusively be said that Kratom was the cause.  To classify this plant as a Schedule 1 drug with the likes off Heroin, Cocaine, and Meth is simply absurd to me.  \n\nThank you for your time.

Cherry picking evidence and omitting data about death and illness associated with Kratom is intellectually dishonest on the DEA's part. Those people were found to have other illicit drugs in their system, yet this possibility wasn't explored; the DEA simply insisted it was Kratom's fault.\n\nBurden of proof works like this: you submit your evidence that a substance is dangerous and actually fits the Schedule I description, not force everyone else to submit evidence that it is safe. Emergency-restricting the plant on no credible or scientific basis like this is a flagrant abuse of power. Since the DEA also gets funding when it makes drug busts, it can also be viewed as a conflict of interest if they get to set policy about which drugs are illegal. Their job should be to enforce what our representative democracy has determined to be illegal.\n\nDespite the fact that the measure would be temporary, two to three years of disuse of Kratom would cause unnecessary pain, loss of life, increase in drug related crimes, and provide ample time for demonizing Kratom so that it stays Schedule I. Kratom is used to curb pain and help ween people off opoid addiction currently. Given the extreme amount of anecdotal evidence, the DEA is not providing sufficient scientific evidence to trump the status quo.\n\nDrugs should be restricted based on scientific understanding of their risks and benefits, weighed against our country's democratic values. To skip every step, scientific and political, and exercise power is abuse of power.\n\nMoving a drug to Schedule I impedes scientific research. So it should only be done after the research has been made, as a measure to bridge the gap between actual lawmaking and the moment we learn the results. The DEA is blindly banning Kratom without any scientific evidence or future political action.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0422","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alice White","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been safely using Kratom for 3 years.

I' am 28 years old and a mechanical adjuster at a local manufacturing plant in my state. I strongly disagree with the proposed ban of kratom. I know a lot of people that take kratom for chronic pain, stress, anxiety and to help get off more dangerous substances like heroine and opiates and alcohol. My father who is a veteran and is 64 years old takes kratom for chronic pain. I started taking kratom about 5 years ago. I became addicted to opiates when I had multiple kidney stones. For 2 years I had an addiction problem with opiates. I heard about kratom and decided to try it. It saved my life and my finances. I' am not an everyday user like I was when I would take opiates and only take it when I' am stressed or after a hard days work. It helps me sleep and lowers my anxiety levels after a stressful day. If it wasn't for kratom I believe I would be taking heroine or even be dead. It should remain legal for many reasons like listed above. Many other substances are much more deadly that should be illegal and are not. In conclusion I hope you hear what the people are saying and understand that kratom has helped save many peoples lives and continues to do so. There are more important things that should be focused on like stopping the flow of heroine coming across the border that is poisoning many young people across the country. I appreciate the DEA opening a public comment so the people can be heard. I hope the right decision is made for the well being of many people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1603","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua DeJarlais","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\nI am a single mother, 35 and I work full time.

Far from being dangerous or harmful, Kratom has been a blessing in my life.  I have used prescription narcotics prescribed to me by my doctor in the past for acute shoulder pain, and have felt the terrible after effects and pull to addiction that these drugs can bring with them.\n  Since finding Kratom over 5 years ago, I have not once needed or craved these addictive prescription medications.  Not only does Kratom help eliminate my shoulder pain, but I feel better overall physically and mentally.  I have not experienced any adverse side effects from using Kratom, and when I stop taking it for any period of time the feeling is no worse than not having your regular morning coffee if you have become accustomed to drinking it daily.  \n  I agree that Kratom should be regulated to ensure purity and that it should not be marketed or sold to minors.  I also think that packaging of Kratom should not be designed to appeal to minors or people seeking a legal high.  But I do think Kratom  should be kept legal for responsible adults who use it to legitimately replace harmful and addictive prescription medicines or narcotics.\n  I watched my father waste away to a shell of his former self  over the past ten years on prescription narcotics provided by the V.A. and his civilian doctor.  He dropped dead last year at the age of 71 after becoming entirely dependent on these meds.  I don't want that to happen me or anyone else.  I feel he could have lived at least 10 more years if not for these dangerous and addictive prescription narcotics.  I tried to introduce him to Kratom in time to save his life, but I was too late and failed him.\n   Please remember that your decision will have serious and life changing consequences for the people effected.  Thank you for your time and for allowing us the chance to speak to your before you make your final decision.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark R.

While I can agree Kratom needs some sort of regulation, but i don't think it should require a prescription. Adults 21+ should be able to choose whether they want to take kratom or not, it can be taxed and regulated. I don't think consuming kratom is unsafe in anyway or form. If we can choose to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol then we should be able to choose to take kratom and buy it in dispensaries that test kratom quality for contaminants(heavy metals, dirt, bugs, bacteria). If anything is wrong with kratom its quality control but if the US government regulated it and inspected it, that would no longer be a problem.  \n\nI think making it schedule 1 is just repeating history in the wrong way. slowy more and more states are legalizing recreational cannabis.

I acknowledge that it is not good to be packaged as a legal high, and unfortunately I believe is what ultimately led to it even being put under such an investigative scrutiny in the first place. It is important to allow access to this supplement to the free people of America.  Statistically this product is safer than many of the over the counter drugs that are being sold in grocery stores today.  For example, people know they aren't supposed to abuse cough medicine, yet some do chasing a high- even while it's illegal and dangerous to do that. Cough syrup still remains in grocery stores properly advertised as such with details on how to take it properly.  People die alot from cough syrup, yet we don't call that an epidemic or take away access to cough syrup from millions of other people who suffer from colds simply because there was a group of people out there who abuses cough syrup and hurts or kills themselves as an unfortunate result.   I know a lot of people who benefit greatly from kratom. I benefit greatly from kratom. In a responsible manner, like green tea! I don't want to make any major claims about specific medical benefits either, but it's been helpful in ensuring many moments made easier from a variety of my own health issues.  It's a beneficial product that has been used in the wrong way and marketed in the wrong way- by some. That is no grounds for a full ban, or we would be banning cough syrup, and other over the counter remedies that could also technically be abused and cause harm. I would rather see it in the vitamin section of a grocery store. If a head shop took cough syrup and changed the label to reflect more of what you see in legal highs packaging today advertising effects of a high, then it would look very bad for cough syrup if that was the only market for it. So then with this commentary period it's important for the DEA to begin to view it in a way that separates the way a product can be used, compared to the way a product is marketed. Please focus more on the bath-salt-chemicals for quelling that type of epidemic. I can understand that there is a real problem with random chemicals flooding the markets and being sold as a dangerous high, but I also know that nobody is going to be taking these bath-salt-chemicals to help any ailments or for any supplemental reason at all. So there are clearly different things afoot here. Please let Kratom as a whole unadulterated herb, remain in it's current legal position. Take note of the differences between a useful product and a product of abuse. Separate it from the list of 'legal highs' that it is not. It got caught up in that market place somehow, but it much rather belongs in the vitamin shops. Seriously, similar to coffee with some additional benefits. People who are looking for big highs could even get angry if they attempt to get high off a thing like kratom. It's not even strong enough for them in that mind altering way. If it's been compared to hard drugs, it offers more of a step down 'landing cushion' sort of thing. Enough to soothe the pain of a withdraw, but yet also not quite enough for them so that the true fully 'into it' addict would call it a tease if they wanted a real fix. I know there's a lot of opinions going on about the benefits of kratom, and I know there's a heroin epidemic at hand too that many claim this herb helps. Please, even if it's not the answer to health issues or even if it's not the answer to an addiction problem, and even if it is possible abuse this substance to some degree- that's besides the point, that there's just not a justifiable reason to actually fully prohibit kratom or it's alkaloids to the degree of schedule I. I do appreciate the idea of protecting from harm. It got stuck somewhere between bath-salt-chemicals and vitamins, yet it's useful enough to the population that it should be legally available in the market some way. Even if it meant needing to be 18+ or to go get a prescription, but to completely outlaw it's place in the market is going too far. I really am perplexed at the over reach of the administration to suggest such a ban in the first place. Please focus on enforcing current law, and please do not overstep the rights of the people to access a supplemental product. Laws can be developed based on the processes that are indoctrinated to the legislative branch. Please re-evaluate your position among the governmental process as a whole. Especially if congress is also sending comments in regard to this situation.

I spent years suffering before I discovered kratom. I can honestly say that this plant has changed my life for the better. Since taking kratom medicinally, my symptoms have virtually disappeared.  I have recently returned to school, currently attaining a master's degree in Psychology. I believe the plant has the potential to help many lives the same way it has helped mine. It should come as no surprise that I strongly disagree with this proposed ban. I believe passing a law limiting kratom consumption to 18+ or 21+ year old's makes a lot more sense. Criminalizing the plant is bound to lead to more issues, as every user I know are law abiding citizens, regular people ranging from ages of 20-75. For instance, my mother has  chronic pain from a series of operations (breast cancer, two hip replacements, knee surgery), she takes kratom instead of Oxycontin prescribed by her doctor. I also know a large number of former drug addicts who claim that Kratom keeps them away from drugs like Heroin and even alcohol.  I urge to please look into alternatives to the proposed ban. Feel free to contact me for further information if necessary.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15693","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick Crawford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7193","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Capt.","postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kevin Griffin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The government has been making a big thing about opiod use; this drug has the reputation of helping people who need opiods for pain.

Mitragynine and its derivatives are dissimilar to traditional opiates in their structure, and relative lack of potency. They is more similar in its potency and effects to Tramadol, a Schedule IV opioid, than to any traditional opiate. Mitragynine has a much higher therapeutic index than traditional opiates, thus presenting a smaller risk of overdose. It is anecdotally less addictive than conventional opiates, and I suspect that you at the DEA would not compare the long-term social and psychological effects of kratom addiction to those of dependency on heroin (Schedule I), or even oxycodone (Schedule II). Mitragynine and its derivatives are opioids and therefore obviously have potential for misuse and abuse. However, by that same coin, they also have analgesic properties, like all other opiates. Given the relatively small risk profile and objective medical benefits of kratom alkaloids, they merit further clinical study, and probably have a medical application. They do not have a high potential for abuse (unless Tramadol does as well). Kratom is used effectively as a pain management drug, without the serious social consequences we generally see with opioid dependency. While kratom alkaloids may require some regulation, to place them in the same scheduling category as heroin is a hyperbolic step in the wrong direction.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10042","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrick Brown","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 29 year old married mother of two, and a vice president at a successful real estate company. After my second child was born, I had severe post partum, but instead of depression, it was more of a feeling of anxiety and a sense of impending doom that can be common as a new mother. I was prescribed Zoloft by my OB/GYN but it did little to help. The anxiety is not something that I dealt with on a daily basis--more like a weekly basis. I was taken off of Zoloft and put on Xanax so that it was something I only took when I needed it and not every day. I may have been less anxious, but I was also extremely fatigued every time I had to resort to this medicine. Anyone with children can tell you that there is no time to rest when you are a mom, especially a working mom. I read about Kratom, and decided to try it. It has completely changed my life. I have no side effects, and no anxiety. I am able to go about my busy schedule knowing that if I feel anxiety come over me, I don't have to resort to RX pills..rather something that is natural and is not addictive. There is a potential to abuse ANYTHING out there....Medicine, food, alcohol, television, etc. To take this herbal remedy off of the market is to destroy the lives who are now functioning because of it, and force them to resort to synthetic drugs that are much more harmful, and much less effective.

They did not offer me another solution for my pain, I was put into immediate withdrawal and my pain was back at 100%.  I did not know what to do.  I had to miss work for a week and I went into the most horrible emotional  and physical state that I would not wish upon my worst enemy. I can't even begin to explain what opiate withdrawal feels like. I had tried Kratom in the past because I was told it was good for pain,  but I hadn't really expanded my knowledge of it. I did some research and found that it could actually help me with my opiate withdrawal as well as the pain. I started using 4 to 6g  2 to 3 times a day and my withdrawal symptoms went away almost completely. My pain has also diminished when taken regularly. If Kratom becomes illegal, I will not be able to work due to my pain and lack of options to control it.  I work with a population of people that not many people work with, I do a civil service. My job is important and I value it. I couldn't work for year due to my pain. I am now able to function and live a somewhat normal life because of Kratom.  Please don't take that away from me. Please don't take that away from so many of us that depend on this herb to survive.  Opiates are the true danger. I feel sorry for all of the people that have to go through withdrawal without kratom. Now I know why people turn to heroin because the withdrawl that I had was the worst experience I've ever had in my life. The Kratom was the only thing that got me through it.  It is really hard to take enough to get to a point where it messes you up in the head, most of the time you throw it up before you got to that point.  So many of us rely on it for its medicinal qualities, schedule one drugs do not have medicinal qualities and Kratom most definitely does.\n Please show some compassion.  People have been using it for hundreds of thousands of years.  Also, it is not an opiate.

The DEA tried sidelining the approved scientific procedures in place to discover the safety of a drug.  Because Kratom is natural without chemical processing the FDA does not govern its usage but that does not entitle the DEA to declare Kratom a drug with the same dangers as heroin.  If an objective scientific study determines it's unsafe for the public then perhaps they should be allowed to regulate but no one has.

I would like to share with you my Kratom story with the DEA & its regulators in hopes of reversing their mind set on this helpful plant. A little bit about me. I am a female in my mid 30's, I am a mother of two beautiful children , I am also a supervisor in a top Fortune 500 company. I am college educated & have over 11 years experience in the finical services industry. I am a responsible kratom user and have been for using kratom safely for about 6 years. I have never been in any legal trouble, never arrested, not even a speeding ticket on my record. In the 6 years I have used this wonderful plant, I have never gotten sick from it, overdosed after consuming it, nearly died,after using it or gone to the E.R. after using kratom. I do not abuse it & I only buy pure Kratom from online verifiable vendors who publish the authenticity of their products. \n\nI fully believe in the power of this plant. Before kratom I went from Dr. to Dr. in hopes they would prescribe me the perfect medicine for my mild depression & anxiety. Every few months I was at the pharmacy with a new expensive prescription.  I would wait the recommended time to allow my body adjust, and sadly each time was a disappointment . I still never felt like myself, I still felt like a zombie and unable to be their for my family 100%. I got sick and tired of being sick and tired, so one day as I lay sobbing on my bed preying for help, I went online and started searching for natural substances for depression. I came across Kratom and ordered my first supply and have never looked back. Kratom helped me feel like me again with no side effects or high cost prescriptions & Drs. visits. I was able to work , I was able to be 100% engaged with my family and friends, & I was able to wake up each morning happy , ready to take on a new day. Kratom is a safe, low cost, effective plant for millions of people battling aliments ranging from depression, anxiety, pain, skin disorders and addiction. \n\nKratom, sadly has taken a hit for some stories in the media. Kratom has been safely used by its indigenous people for thousands of years. There is not one report (that I could find) showing kratom to be a direct result of death in a user. The reports and stories online are one filled with misinformation, those stories stating that Kratom is a result in ones death are false, those deaths were a direct result of dangerous drugs that were ingested by the user. I do agree that Kratom should have regulations around the purchase of Kratom. The responsible kratom users and the DEA want the same thing, to keep dangerous kratom out of the public. I know a lot of the reason Kratom has a bad name is from companies who mix substances in their kratom or vendors who market their kratom as a \"legal high\" or vendors who simply don't care and are trying to sell whatever they can to make money. My biggest suggestion would to stop allowing kratom to be sold in head shops (online only) & to make age restrictions on this product, in fact over 1/2 of responsible kratom consumers are over the age of 21. Lastly, creating a website or link that when the kratom community sees an irresponsible vendor or brand on the market, we can report it and they be investigate then shut down. The DEA & the Katom Community can work together to get bad companies off the market. Please do not punish the entire responsible kratom community for the irresponsible vendors. More people die from alcohol, tobacco & energy drinks then anything, but those products are still legal and sold.\n\nIn my closing statement, I would like ask the DEA to understand when evaluating the benefits vs the negative side effects , that the benefits outweigh the side effects 100 to 1. Kratom does help millions of Americans with chronic conditions, Kratom is safe, Kratom is affordable, Kratom has never cause a death, Kratom is not addictive, & Kratom deserves to stay available and legal to the millions of people including myself.  Thank you for taking the time to let me share my story.\n\nSincerely, \n\nJessica Dennis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2438","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Dennis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be categorized as a schedule 1 drug.

At the very least it does have SOME medicinal benefit so scheduling it as a substance with no medicinal attributes is COMPLETELY unfounded and uncalled for. This is just like the nonsensical marijuana debacle where it's scheduled a \"1\" when study after study proves this to be ABSOLUTELY FALSE. Can we stop making laws based on fear? Can we stop making laws based on ignorance? Why can't we trust in our fellow man and if someone wants to use a PLANT to make it through life without a prescription they should be allowed to.

I've had them since I was 8 and over the past few years I was prescribed Vicodin as the only medicine that was able to kill off the pain. I had had MRI's, I had seen neurologists, I had been to the ER multiple times due to the pain...I had tried many migraine medicines, holistics, etc and I knew I was in trouble when Vicodin worked. \n\nI use Kratom when I have migraines. I use it to kill off the pain without having  to resort to Vicodin - going on my third or fourth year with it, I'm too afraid to give it up because my migraine pain is unbearable...it actually makes me throw up. Kratom has been a saving grace. Not only do I use it for migraines, but I use different strands for my anxiety and chronic depression AND bi-polar II disorder. With Kratom, I can maintain and regulate all of my emotions and pain without 2-3 RX's a day.\n\nI am a functioning member of this society. I am married to a Ssgt in the Air Force...I bought my first house when I was 22 years old, brand new.

Without it, I am going to end up another statistic hooked on pain killers and taking pills for every emotion I have.\n\nPlease, please...look into this product for the GOOD it can do. Not the bad. I have never had a bad experience with Kratom.

I became addicted to prescription opioids in high school and heroin in college. Many traumatized people like myself end up in this predicament because we are unable to cope with our baseline psychological state. By the age of 23, I was unable to continue my university education due to the agony of opiate withdrawal. I ended up on methadone but I quickly tapered down to a small dose so that I could switch to Suboxone. Suboxone saved my life. It was a less powerful long acting opioid and it brought stability to my life. However, I still wanted to get completely clean as I was tired of the side-effects and the monthly fear of losing my Dr.and losing my job. \n\nI began tapering off of Suboxone from 24mg down to 1mg a day and then I hit a road block. I simply could not function as a student or an employee. I tried kratom tea on a friends recommendation and I could not believe how effective it was at stopping the agonizing withdrawal symptoms I was experiencing. This plant is as psychoactive as a cup of coffee. I am not high or inebriated while under its influence, it simply stops withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIt is a miracle plant that gives all of our great country's addicts a fighting chance to stop doing opiates. For someone like me who has tried quitting cold turkey 100's of times only to relapse time and again, kratom is the perfect final stepping stone on a long hard journey out of hell. Without it, I would be stuck on Suboxone forever.\n\nNow, I am working full time and I have a 3.9 GPA at NMSU. I couldn't have made it this far without it. You are the stewards of our great country and you have a choice to keep all of us locked in a pattern of withdrawal and relapse or to allow a safe, natural alternative that is very effective in the crucial final step of completely quitting narcotics to stay on the market. We have a lot to offer the world and we are sick and tired of being crippled by the small percentage of people in the pharmaceutical industry who are the most egregious offenders of human rights. Please, stand with the American people in solidarity, not with whichever pharmaceutical company is planning on releasing a kratom based drug.

Therefore I'd like to ask to whom it may concern that you please do not make this natural product that I can use to help me an \"illegal drug\". The teas that I make with this products really help me to function in normal everyday life which is usually very hard for me to do without the narcotic medications or illegal narcotics. So I'm putting this comment in for whoever may be able to read it and who may be able to help keep from making this an illegal substance. Thank you.\n\n\n                                                                                      Jeffrey w Riggs","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3040","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Riggs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \n\nMy name is Linda Kettles. I am a 56 year old woman, a registered nurse, and I own a consulting company called Kettles Healthcare Consulting, LLC. I want to tell you about how Kratom significantly changed my life for the better. \n\nAbout 5 years ago I developed an autoimmune disorder that causes me severe and debilitating joint pain. I went from a very active person, national public speaker, teacher and manager, to a person who was bound to a wheel chair due to pain. I was on steroids and multiple other medications including opiates. These medications barely managed the pain and my quality of life was extremely low. \n\nThen a friend told me about Kratom. I liked that it has been used for literally thousands of years and that it is used in its natural state, simply crushed leaves. I started taking this herb about 2 years ago. The effect it has had on my life has been transformational. It controls my pain to the point that I no longer need a wheelchair, in fact most days I can walk independently without even a cane. \n\nI have experienced ZERO side effects with Kratom as opposed to the many adverse drug reactions that I had with opiates and steroids. It has no less than given me my life back. \n\nNow, people are thinking of making this life saving herb illegal and classed as equal to heroin? I can't begin to express the bewilderment, fear and anger this causes me. \n\nIf I am no longer able to access this herb, I will literally lose my normal life again. I am asking - no I am begging - please do not bar the use of this simple herb to me. And the thousands of other people who's health and well-being depend on access to it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7996","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Linda Kettles","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"God Bless the work you do.

After a serious car accident in 2000, I became dependent on Vocodin.  When my doctor quit prescribing them, I turned to tele-medicine.  After that was banned, I went to the black market, eventually graduating to IV dilaudid.  I spent thousands on pills, all while drinking heavily.  Then I found kratom.\n\nKratom took away all cravings, and provided a mild euphoria and relaxation effect.  More interesting perhaps is that it rendered other drugs, especially alcohol, less intoxicating.  I have no idea how this worked, but while taking kratom I couldn't get drunk.  The effects of alcohol suddenly had a ceiling, and other opiates would have little to no effect.  Thus, there was no need to drink or consume drugs, and the effects of the kratom weren't intense enough to limit my productivity or interfere with my life or relationships.  Because different strains are available, rotating through various types of kratom prevented tolerance and the therapeutic effects could be managed for years.  When forced to stop because of the pending ban, withdrawals were nothing compared to what I experienced trying to quit prescription drugs.  Even though it became available again, I've chosen to refrain from taking it, and can now say I'm completely sober.  It has been 2.5 years since I've had a drink.\n\nA year and a half ago my brother died from an overdose.  We were estranged, and I feel guilty for not introducing him to kratom.  He might still be alive today.  While I'm certainly glad that dilaudid and vicodin can't be purchased over the counter, kratom is something that can safely be left to the public.  Yes, there will be accidents and tragedies, as there are with cars and knives and bathtubs.  The positive benefits of kratom for society far outweigh the negative, by a tremendous order of magnitude.  Please do not prohibit this lifeline from being utilized by those wishing to reclaim their lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19818","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Samuel Gerbyshak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a US Navy veteran, a practicing nurse and i believe in the benefits of Kratom. \nI have seen it manage depression, pain and without the horrific results of addiction or withdrawal.  \nPlease, please,please keep Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20044","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Peace","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am leaving a comment to try and accurately express my feelings toward kratom. I personally have used kratom, to great benefit, for a little over 2 years. Throughout my life I have struggled with bouts of depression and stinging social anxiety. With the use of 1 single tea spoon of kratom a day I have been given the freedom of actually living and having a social life and feeling at ease with normal everyday situations. Although this is not why I came to kratom this is one of the greatest lasting effects. I came to kratom after an injury, I herniated 2 discs in my back senior year in high school. I was unfortunately put on some heavy pain meds which inevitably led to wanting more pain meds, this problem grew and I became a slave to the meds. When I finally couldn't take any more I did some research about alternatives and came across something called kratom powder. After more research I started to narrow down dosage for myself personally. With the help of just 1 teaspoon of kratom a day I slowly limited my pain throughout my body, shooting, stabbing pain in my legs with pins and needles and numb toes. I started to train for a triathlon because that was my recovery goal. I am now 4 triathlons in and want to push toward an iron man triathlon. Please do not limit my access to a natural plant medicine that has helped not only myself but many of my friends dealing with a number of debilitating problems. Please allow the research to be truthfully done and truthfully reported. These natural plant medicines are an integral part of many people's lives, and it should be their choice.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1856","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"JD Wood","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I work in the information systems field.

I, like many tens of thousands of other responsible kratom users, implore you to keep kratom legal. First, it is a safe, non-toxic alternative to dangerous, addictive and highly-destructive opioids. It provides users with relief needed to function in society, go to work, care for their families, and so much more, giving them a quality of life previously unavailable, and certainly not obtainable while using opioids. Second, it is an herb that has been used safely and effectively for hundreds of years in its native Southeast Asia. It is certainly worth noting that Canada has accurately classified kratom as an herbal supplement. Third, as you are well aware, there is an opioid abuse epidemic in our country which has been increasing exponentially in severity with no signs of slowing down. Kratom offers safe and effective relief from many symptoms typically requiring opioid use, without causing the very destructive harm of that of opioids, and without its highly-addictive qualities. And, finally, kratom, a safe and effective plant in the same family as coffee, has no business as a schedule 1 substance with the likes of ecstasy, heroin, lsd, cocaine, etc. Please, please, please do not deprive tens of thousands, and more, of their safe and effective herbal medicine. \n\nThank you very much for your attention to this matter.\n\nRespectfully,\nSara Pica","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20468","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sara Pica","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Do not list Kratom as a schedule 1 drug.

I was prescribed Meloxicam and Tramadol to manage the pain but they are not effective, and the Tramadol is habit-forming too.  I discovered kratom 5 months ago and have been using it to manage the pain.  One cup with 5g of kratom effectively kills the pain for about 12 hours and I am able to lead an active life again.  Better yet, it is, unlike Tramadol, not habit-forming.  I use it only when I need it and experience no cravings for it at other times.  I have run out of my supply several times and did not have any problems other than the return of the pain.  \n\nI understand one of the pharmaceutical companies wants to study kratom to use to formulate their own prescription analgaesic, and that is what is actually behind the move to ban free use of kratom.

I began reading up on what is known about kratom so far. \nIt is an opioid-free pain reliever commonly used to address pain and opioid withdrawl symptoms. Studies suggest that kratom doesnt have a particularly high potential for recreational abuse, and the positive effects appear to outweigh the negatives. \nOpiate addiction is a literal epidemic- mostly in poor communities. I witnessed the horror of opiate addiction, as my former step father was addicted to opioids that were prescribed to him by his doctor for a shoulder injury. At one time my step father was a brilliant man whom I loved and trusted. He helped improve mine and my mother's living situation tremendously. After about a year of being prescribed opioids, my step father began to spiral into a terrible addiction. He is now homeless. I won't get into the details of the horrible things I witnessed and felt because of his addiction, just know that it ruined his life, and traumatized me and my mother.\nPlease do more thorough research on kratom and do not add it to the schedule 1 drug list.

I believe Kratom should not be a scheduled substance. Kratom is a safe & effective plant & dietary supplement. It's effects are similar to coffee & the plants are closely related. It is about as addictive as coffee & withdrawal symptoms are the same.\n\nI have pain & weakness caused by Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, bulging discs, sciatic nerve pain & degenerative disc disease. I was on dangerous pharmaceutical medications for my pain approximately 10 years. Shortly after starting this medication I had to start taking more pharmaceuticals to treat the side effects of the pain medications. Eventually you have to start taking more medications to treat the pain because your body builds a tolerance. This was a vicious cycle that caused more harm than good. My body became physically addicted to the medications. I was in constant pain & had no quality of life. I tried several times to stop taking these drugs but my body was so weak & the withdrawal symptoms so terrible I ended up in the emergency room. I felt hopeless in this situation. Then one day I saw a post in my Chronic Pain support group on Facebook from a member that claimed she was able to stop taking her medications & return to a productive life with the help of a plant leaf called Kratom. I was intrigued. I did some research & placed an order. Kratom helped me break out of the horrible cycle & return to quality of life. I have been taking Kratom approximately 2 years & have been able to stop taking all the dangerous toxic medications.\n\nI believe that treating my health the way I wish is a fundamental unalienable right. I don't believe American adults need to be mothered by an unelected government agency.

I am opposed to the DEA's possible decision to place kratom as a schedule 1 substance. It would be a decision that would effect a lot of peoples life in a negative way including myself. I currently take the herb kratom as a supplement to help with my anxiety  I have been taking this herb for three years and it has had such a positive impact on my life. It has not cured my anxiety but it has helped extremely. Before I found kratom I was having extreme anxiety and panic attacks daily, I seen my doctor on a regular basis and tried many prescription drugs, the only medication that helped was the benzodiazipine class of drugs. I was prescribed xanax which I took daily it helped with my anxiety but had a horrible impact on my life. This medication altered my mind it made me feel high and not myself. I figured since it was prescribed by a doctor that it was safe to continue to take and it was the only thing I found to stop my panic attacks. A year into being on this medication it stopped working and my doctor raised my dosage. Everyone in my life told me I had changed I acted differently and made poor decisions I tried to stop taking xanax and had bad withdrawl symptoms, my panic attacks came back worse than ever. I stared taking it again because I felt horrible when I didn't. Two years later my dosage had been raised even higher and my relationships with my family, husband, and friends were beginning to deteriorate. Everyone told me I was different and not in a good way, I realised I was addicted and dependant on this medication I was not the person, mother, and wife that I wanted to be. I decided I was going to go off of it once and for all. I started researching natural remedys for anxiety and I came across kratom, I read reviews online with people saying that it was safe and effective in helping with pain, anxiety, and opiate addiction. I talked to my doctor who told me it was a good idea to not continue taking xanax if I thought I was addicted. I told him I was interested in trying kratom so he researched it and told me he was fine with me giving it a try if I ordered through a reputable source. I found a vendor with good reviews and ordered kratom. I completely stopped taking xanax and was having withdrawl and horrible anxiety the day I tried kratom. I took a low dose and the result was far grater than I expected. It took the edge off the withdrall process and eased my anxiety, all while not effecting my mind. I could still think clearly and function normally which I couldn't while on xanax. I continued to take it daily, I was feeling better than ever and my family told me I was finally acting like my self again. I have taken kratom as a suplliment for three years now; in my experience with this leaf it is not addictive, mind altering, or anything close to a drug. It did not replace xanax for me it simply is a better safer option to dangerous prescription drugs. I no longer avoid situations in fear of having an anxiety attack, it has helped me live my life in a healthy productive way.  On days when I do not need to take it I feel no symptoms of withdrall, I am not dependant on this herb and it did not cure my anxiety but it helps me manage it. To me kratom is a miracle plant, it has helped me be a better mother, wife, and a more productive member of society. I am comfortable and happy with the person I am today. The quality of my life and many others would be greatly decreased if this plant becomes a schedule 1 substance. If I no longer had access to this plant I would not turn back to xanax or any other dangerous prescription drugs but I fear many others would. My life and mental health would not be as good as it is now. Kratom has changed so many people lives for the better and for some people has even saved their life. I can not understand how a plant that is so beneficial and safe would even be considered to become illegal. Please do not schedule kratom it will negatively effect so many people who use it as a supplement myself included. \nThank you for your time and consideration\n\nSincerely, \nSarina Shadduck","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22486","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarina Shadduck","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi there, I just wanted to take a minute to discuss kratom.

Tramodol, Gabapentin and so on with almost no affect. The pain and debility  had a serious impact on my daily life, forcing me to lay down a good portion of the day and I was unable to work. My search led me to Kratom earlier this year, 2016.. kratom was very effective in making my pain tolerable without any side affects. It allowed me to feel normal, like my old self. I started with One and a half Teaspoons twice a day and have continued at that dosage now for many months.\nI have read hundreds of testimonials of people with similar and much worse problems for a vast array of difficulties who receive similar benefits. My research has shown that there is almost no real harmful side affects even with over dosing. Too much of anything can be harmful, but too much of Kratom won't harm you from my research. It can make you feel sick for a short time, but this is only from over dosing. There is much evidence that something as common as Ibupropen  can cause liver damage etc.\nI can easily stop my Kratom without any side affects, so I have found at these therapeutic dosages it is not addicting, certainly no more than coffee. Compared to the known opiates for pain its not life threatening or addicting. Finally its inexpensive in tis current availability which helps meany of us who have to be careful about our spending. \nIts seems counter to its purpose of protecting the public for the DEA to ban Kratom and make it a crime to freely purchase something that is harmless, none addictive, benefits millions of people in many ways, is inexpensive and has been around for literally thousands of years helping man without harming him.

To make this a schedule I drug will endanger many lives because even if the pharmaceutical companies synthesize it as they are already trying to do, the decreased access and increased cost will be a deterrent for many. The reason this herb is so successful is that while the plant itself is related to the coffee plant, it binds with opiate receptors in humans, but through a different neural pathway so it doesn't cause somnolence or respiratory depression as is seen with narcotics, but at the same time eases the cravings for narcotics that people with addiction problems are susceptible to. Additionally, I have no doubt that outlawing this product will directly lead to a spike in opioid related deaths. Look at the jurisdictions that have outlawed it recently, Alabama for one, and look at the statistics for yourself. Any 10 year old can connect the dots on this one.

I hold a full time position at a  university. I use kratom 2-3 times weekly for chronic pain caused by arthritis & fibromyalgia. Previously, I was prescribed high daily doses of both Ibuprofen & naproxen to ease my pain & inflammation. I did not like taking these, as they are very hard on my stomach, as well as I built up a tolerance and they really didn't help that much the longer I took them. I came across kratom and tried it, thinking it wouldn't hurt to seek a possible alternative. I didn't high expectations, as taking supplements in the past for me has usually been unsuccessful. However, kratom really worked for me. I use it very carefully, so that a do not build a tolerance. On days I do not take it, if I am feeling particularly bad, I will take some otc pain reliever, but I have successfully stopped taking the higher dosage inflammatory medications to manage my pain, which is a godsend. If kratom is made illegal, you will essentially destroying all the good that this plant extract brings to people like myself. I understand there are people way worse off than me who also have had their quality of life greatly improved by responsibly using kratom. The desire to outlaw something with such positive effects, something that is, in fact, less dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes, is appalling and shameful. Kratom, alone, has never caused death in an individual  (deaths allegedly attributed to it have been misreported, as there were other substances found in their systems). The is no \"high\" involved and it cannot (at least in my experience) be used recreationally. Reports of people \"getting high\" are simply exaggerated or false. Overdosing on kratom is also not possible, as ingesting too much simply causes one to vomit it out. I have never done this, but it is proven fact. There are far more dangerous substances (some of which are even legal) than kratom. How many deaths occur each year from alcohol? I implore you, please do not take kratom away from those of us it helps so much. Please do not force sufferers of chronic pain to go back to high dosage pain relievers (and even opiates). I trust you will make the correct decision to allow kratom to remain legal in this country.

I am truly grateful that the DEA has listened to the public outcry against this unreasonable scheduling of a medicinal plant that is helping thousands upon thousands of people treat their pain and other symptoms without resorting to the use of more dangerous and addictive opiates, from oxycontin to heroin.  Here are some main points to consider when making your decision:\n\n- A schedule 1 drug is supposed to be something that has NO medicinal benefits.  Kratom has been proven to have MANY benefits, as experienced by the thousands of people you have already heard from.  They're not making it up in order to keep some \"legal high\", legal, as most do not even get a high from kratom.  (despite what some of the sellers of the product irresponsibly claim it is for).  \n\n- It is NOT dangerous or deadly.  Of the, what is it, 11? deaths \"caused\" by kratom, I believe almost all of them were in combination with other, worse drugs, that you as well as I know were more than likely the cause of death in those situations.  Kratom, taken alone, is almost impossible to overdose on, as the dosage would be well over a half ounce of powdered leaf.  Almost anyone who takes this much will be overcome with severe nausea, causing them to vomit it out long before it could do any damage (so is it even possible to overdose? I doubt it, your stomach will reject any dosage too high).  As an experienced user (I have chronic lyme disease, it helps my pain and gives me the energy to be able to function almost like a normal person), I have discovered that Kratom is what I call a \"self-limiting\" herbal.  You have to find the right dosage that helps your symptoms, and if you go over that dosage to \"get high\", you will only end up with negative side effects, which goes back to my original point, it is NOT dangerous, and is self regulating in dosage.\n\n- I think the better idea here would be to keep it totally legal, as a dietary supplement, but maybe spread TRUTHFUL information about it, ie; warnings about combining it with other drugs, warnings about safe dosages, etc.  I think it should be treated like any herbal supplement (which it is), that is regulated by the FDA, ie; - \"this product is not intended to cure, diagnose, or prevent and disease....\" you know the rest.  Maybe have the FDA regulate and watch it, making sure there are no harmful adulterants to the plain powdered leaf it should be, and maybe even go as far as testing to see the levels of the active components in the leaf so that we can be sure what we're taking is safe, and know it's strength.  Again, an FDA issue - not a DEA issue.\n\n- Here's what's going to happen if you place Kratom as a schedule 1 drug:  Tens (maybe hundreds?) of thousands of people, like myself, who depend on it for pain relief, are going to be FORCED to turn to something else.  You think we have a heroin epidemic now?  If you make Kratom just as illegal as Heroin, people are going to turn to that, or oxycontin, or whatever else they can find to treat their pain.  These other options are MUCH more dangerous and addictive that Kratom.  Yes, kratom is opioid-LIKE, but it is not an opiate.  Unlike heroin and oxycontin or other synthetic opiates, kratom has very minimal withdrawl symptoms, and someone who no longer needs it and wants to quit using it, will be able to do so with little discomfort, and won't need to resort to something else, possibly much worse.\n\nI don't want to keep going on, and feel I have made my major points.  I hope that you will see them and re-consider the need to schedule Kratom at all.  There just isn't a need.  It alone does not kill people.  But what people will turn to if they aren't able to get it anymore, can and will.  If you honestly care about saving lives and NOT making the heroin/opiate epidemic WORSE, you must seriously consider leaving Kratom unscheduled, and letting the FDA handle any regulation in it's regard as a dietary supplement.\n\nThank you for your time, and please do the right thing, there are too many people at risk here.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3956","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt DeBaets","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After doing a ton of research on Kratom and watching the effect it had on my sister who has battled a doctor prescribed opiate addiction i am in favor of keeping this PLANT legal for people to use.

They will be yours for food.\"  (Gen 1:29) \n   Henceforth, I am praying that Jesus will help you to see that the kratom plant is good, and it is made for man to consume. Also, I pray that The Mighty One will continually bless you, His appointed servants, with His divine wisdom to govern The United States of America with justice and righteousness, as you work to help establish more wise and prudent regulations for this great and diverse nation, which He has established for the glory of His name. \nAmen\nThat is the most important part of this message. \n\n   Also, I want to share with you how I thank Jesus, our Lord, who made the Kratom plant which, has helped on many occasions to warmly interact with my coworkers, neighbors and family, when I have been weighed down by seasonal blues of the midwest, or by every day anxieties, much like a nice cup of coffee will often help to pep me up before work. I do not get addicted, no not as much as I do to Dove dark chocolate. Kratom has a self regulating quality for me. Like it's cousin coffee, my tolerance builds up and I find that I have to stop taking it in order for the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects to be present. I feel no withdrawals, except maybe some sleepiness, alike caffeine withdrawals. However, I do know some who are responsibly taking smaller doses on a daily basis for pain, and it is most certainly a God send for them. \n     I would be thankful to see Kratom vendors being required by you to run lab test on their products, because, by far, the worst Kratom I have ever taken has come from companies who are refusing to comment in detail on the makeup of their products, or to give any lab analysis on them. This kratom has sometimes made me puke and given me aching head nerves(head ache), like drinking too many sulfites in red wine, or heavy yeast in a good craft beer. For what its worth, the absolute worst thing that I am seeing is that clandestine labs overseas  are foolishly making \"mitragynine\" alkaloids and then putting them in products called, \"kratom.\"  These products are worthless and insalubrious, I hope you are able to consider why I am saying this. \n\nFinally, I want to thank you all for taking the time to hear and consider the voices of your neighbors and friends, who all hope to keep using the Mitragyna speciosa (kratom)  plant for its salubrious effects. \nMay The God of hope and love grant you all peace and safety, in the name of Jesus. amen. \n\n--Marty Miller(age 32)\nBelleville, Illinois\nDevout follower of Jesus Christ and currently employed as a Laboratory technician for the Baldwin Energy Complex, in Baldwin Illinois. \n\n  \n  ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22729","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Martin Miller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"While I understand the DEA concern about potential kratom safety issues, I must disagree that this herbal product is dangerous.

I am a 53 year old male, graphic artist, veteran and father of two young children. \nI oppose the scheduling of kratom, particularly schedule 1, when tobacco, tobacco products and e-cigarettes are not scheduled similarly. What benefits are obtained from smoking? There is certainly enough medical evidence to prove it is harmful and it's most certainly addictive. I myself smoked for 13 years before quitting two decades ago. Little study has been done on the effects of e-cigarettes.  It appears that often, when seemingly harmless herbs, plants, roots etc are found to be of benefit but may threaten the coffers of large pharmaceuticals or tobacco companies (big lobbies), the DEA is quick to schedule or regulate their usage.  It leaves me distrusting the intent of the DEA or its freedom from undue influence. \nPerhaps long term effects of kratom use are not known. This justifies further study before making it unattainable. I began experimental usage of it nearly a year ago after researching alternatives to prescription medication. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Careful use of kratom has saved me from having to refill prescriptions for alprazolam with it's potential for dependency, and has allowed me to reduce my intake of costly buproprion. I experience a reduction in anxiety and mild mood elevation from the use of kratom. The effect has a duration of several hours and allows for me to enjoy more restful sleep when I take it in the evening. This has in turn helped me improve my interactions with my family and a blessing. \nI also discovered that it reduces diarrhea I suffer daily from the use of prescription medications I take for allergies, acid reflux and hypertension.  I have tried unsuccessfully to offset this unpleasant side effect of prescription medication by eating yogurt and staggering my prescription schedule. To me the effects of kratom use are positive and significant. Kratom use has allowed me to step back from the toxicity of man-made pharmaceuticals and their inherent cost, and improved my quality of life. \nI have had only one negative experience with kratom, this when I first began experimenting with it. I experienced mild nausea because I attempted to ingest it in powdered form without the benefit of encapsulation. The nausea lasted only briefly and I have experienced no further negative effects. I have little or no concern of becoming addicted after having been able to quit smoking cigarettes. I would like to be able to depend on its availability though, given the alternatives.\nI appreciate the large responsibility of the DEA to the American public and the protection it has provided us. Please do not strengthen the perception of it being partial to lobbyists, and allow for the study of kratom by not scheduling it thereby making it unavailable to those of us who use it carefully and experience it's benefits. \nThank you for opening this up to public comment, and for taking the time to read these comments. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJesse Stretch","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19771","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jesse Stretch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\n  My name is Brian and I am a disable veteran.

Prescribed to me for a bad car accident i was in. Living in Fl gave me access to 1000's of Doctors who would prescribe me anything i asked for!!. Thus causing my addiction. I went to a pain management clinic where they put me on 30mgs of methadone. Within 2 weeks they had me up to 90mgs of methadone. At30 mgs i was not myself, nodding off, lost my job of 10 years lost my family, wouldnt even visit my mother who has since passed on because i was so messed up. Then i found Kratom tried it and in one day i was completely off all p.k.'s. I got my life back!!! About 5 months later i was stopped by Largo, police out of Pinellas County. The area i lived in was kown as a high drug area.  So they searched me, and found the Kratom. They asked me what it was, i told them and they did test it and found no traces of any drugs in it. A few minutes later more cops showed up and stated to me that many of their officers take Kratom, due to all the weight they carry around(vest, gun, flaslight,etc. And that the kratom helps them to be more alert, better than coffee they said!! They let me go, but b4 i left i talked with them about kratom and told them im not knocking on peoples doors at 3am anymore looking for any drug available. They stated that Kratom has profoundly help them fight Florida's current opiate epidemic!! I went back to the methadone clinic to tell others who were hooked on various substance's, and when the staff there asked me what i was doing, i explained Kratom to them. They then threatened me with  trespassing. They told me they know Kratom helps people get off of drugs, but i was \"stealing\"  thier customers( i told them i thought they were your patients), they laughed and said its all about the $$ not getting people off of drugs..(so sad i thought to myself). Since finding Kratom i have helped 100's of people kick their addictions!! I have held a steady job for 7+ years now & have not gotten in trouble with the law since i was introduced to opiates. Im building a better relationship with my family that I havent had in a long time. Im not lazy anymore. I dont want to isolate myself. I want to go out, I want to be out of the house. I now have a bank account with money in checking and savings, where as b4 i would pawn anything of value just to get my next fix.. I started my whole life over, got rid of all the bad people in my life. I have new friends who dont do any drugs, i Recently was blessed with a new baby.. The thought of rasing a child while i was in my old frame of mind, frightens me!! Kratom has drastically changed my life and many others for the better. And when i didnt have any kratom available, I wasnt banging on peoples doors looking to get a fix of anything they may be selling. I just wait patiently for my kratom to arrive and all is well.. For if it wasnt for Kratom id probably be dead or in jail.

I also have PTSD as well. I have lost my mother, father, brother, grandparents and numerous family. I was abused as a child both sexually and physically.

I then spent another year getting cleaned up through rehabs and detoxes. I lost my home, car, job and family over pharmacy medications that doctors hand out like candy. After cleaning myself up, I still had mental health issues. I refused to take medication and deal with the extreme side effects that pharmaceutical companies would have you believe its \"normal\".  I found Kratom about this time. It helped me focus on myself ore than I had ever. I cleaned up, got my job, eventually bought a vehicle, then a home. I went from living on the streets to getting married, having a home and life. Taking care of my family. I have now taken Kratom daily for the last 3 years and have NEVER had the side effects the media would have you believe. I have never OD, never got sick, never had \"addictive effects\". It has helped me balance my mood, increase my motivation and to live a healthy, productive life. If Kratom is banned. I am scared I will decline. I am not addicted but it is no different than maintenance medication for any other ailment.  There has never been a death related to Kratom alone, nor injury or OD. I feel this attempt to ban is a ploy by \"big pharm\" to quite our attempt at ridding ourselves of the junk that doctors force feed us. Kratom is no more harmful than a cup of coffee. In fact, the effects are no more greater. It is not a substance to get you \"high\". It is a natural plant, that God has once again tried to give us. Sometimes we pray for help, but expect God to fix it automatically, when in reality, he places the opportunity in our path in hopes we will use the God given intelligence to help ourselves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5571","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"john harrigal","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"First I'd like you to know that i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia almost 10 years ago today.

I am a workforce manager for the Academic Advising department of a prominent Christian University, and I am strongly against the scheduling of Kratom. At very young age I was diagnosed with both restless leg syndrome and periodic limb jerk disorder. The symptoms are most prevalent when I am sitting or laying down, most often they present with a pain in my legs that is only eased when I move. Over the years I have had a very difficult time sleeping due to my legs, which has caused in itself multiple other issues such as stress, difficulty concentrating and at times depression. I have been prescribed a multitude of medications over the years in an effort to combat this symptoms, from muscle relaxers, pain killers, anti-depressants, etc. Each medication came with its own course of side effect, often times worse then the symptoms I was experiencing. In December of 2013 I came a crossed an article about the benefits of Kratom for those with RLS and PLJD. I deeply wanted to stop taking prescription medications and try a more natural option. I have now been taking kratom daily for 3 year, i no longer have any RLS symptoms, I sleep great, and i have not experienced any negative side effects from Kratom.

When I was 20, my coworker suggested Kratom after learning I was relying on alcohol to combat depression, anxiety, and the worst part terrible insomnia. I have been taking Kratom at high doses for 6 years. I regularly work out, ride my bike, visit the doctor etc. I have never had any health professionals find any issues and without Kratom I would not be in such good shape. When I wasn't taking Kratom I didn't wanna get out of bed, I had no desire to do anything let alone work out, walk my dog, ride my bike. \n\nI tried anxiety meds and it was terrible. I couldn't stay awake, I couldn't work and I ended up getting in a cycle of abusing prescription medicine. My mom died of a prescription drug overdose. I cannot afford to go back to prescription meds. If I do that could happen to me. I have had mental health issues and struggled with addiction since I was in high school. Now I work full time and am just an all around normal functioning person. \n\nBanning Kratom is illogical and draconian. We have been using Kratom for centuries if not longer, it makes no sense to criminalize possession of a natural plant. We are setting ourselves back with this initiative. Kratom could save lives if given the chance. \n\nMore people need to know about how Kratom can safely help opioid, pain, and insomnia issues. I sleep the best I have ever slept with Kratom. When I dont take it, I wake up multiple times in the night, feel terrible the next day and its hard to go through work all day feeling like that. \n\nInstead of banning Kratom, please help us study and understand the most we can about this plant so we can potentially end opioid addiction. This plant has the potential to eradicate the cycle of prescription drug abuse. Every comment here represents that.\n\nImagine the good it could do with health professionals giving patients Kratom in combination with therapy. This could change people's lives. I doubt anyone would read all these comments. I know this about big pharma money. But please do the right thing. People's lives rely on this.

I'm a 28 year old Texan and small business owner. I started using kratom roughly two years ago as a means of controlling my chronic anxiety. I had been prescribed a number of pharmaceuticals in the past, but none of them succeeded in alleviating my symptoms. Kratom was, and I hesitate saying this for fear of sounding trite, a true life-saver. I continue to use it on a regular basis, and my life has undoubtedly been made better by doing so.\n\nIt should be noted that kratom is not a crutch for me. It's not an escape. It is a beautiful supplement that helps me achieve the things I want in life without the twisted stomach and racing thoughts that my anxiety produces. It truly alarms me that certain agencies are wanting to take away natural medicine, leaving us only with dangerous pharmaceuticals. If I were a more cynical man, I'd be inclined to think that our government is in bed with these huge synthetic drug companies. \n\nPlease think of the people here. \n\nThank you for reading.

Though my pain is rarely severe (4-5 on the pain scale) it is constant. Kratom enables me to go without prescription narcotics for pain as well as the energy drinks I have used to combat the fatigue associated with my condition. \nI find it to be very mild and subtle. Abuse seems pretty far fetched to me because it seems so acidic. That is to say any amount more than a tablespoon (8-9 grams) is likely to upset my stomach. This amount affects me on a level comparable to a large cup of strong black coffee and leaves me feeling neither inebriated nor impaired.\nThe proposed ban and scheduling of Kratom as a class one drug seems draconian,  unnecessary, and counterproductive. This herbal remedy helps thousands of people who suffer with chronic pain and has been used for centuries. Overdoses on Kratom alone are all but unheard of, and despite some published information, Kratom does not suppress respiration like true narcotics, which is the actual cause of most overdoses. \nWe are supposedly free in this country, but the government is self-perpetuating and grows itself and is ever more intrusive into the lives of citizens. Many Kratom users suspect that the DEA is acting to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical companies, which stand to lose profits from real addictive and dangerous drugs such as oxycontin, methadone, and hydrocodone. Citizens are weary and tired of government overreach. I respectfully request that the DEA and FDA stand down in classifying Kratom as a schedule one drug as it helps so many people and is more accurately defined as an herbal remedy or dietary supplement.

But growing up through most of my entire life I had this sickness that nothing could get rid of. My anxiety and depression had me feeling miserable most of my entire life. I live a fairly healthy lifestyle. I eat and exercise daily but somehow I still couldn't shake these horrible sickness. It wasn't until I was the age of 21 that I started dabbling into drugs hoping to find a cure for my crippling anxiety. I went to doctors hoping there be some miracle drug that would make my sickness go away. All I was found was more trouble. All the prescription drugs that I've taken gave me horrible side effects. They either made me more tired or made my brain very cloudy. So I started looking for alternatives. I started using anything legal that I can find on the internet. While those didn't do much I had gave up on trying out new stuff for a long period of time. It wasn't until the beginning of 2016 that I had discovered Kratom. Im not going to lie and say this plant worked right away. It took me several doses to find a nice sweet spot that worked. I started out taking very little doses, around 1 gram or less. But as I continue to up my dosage each day I noticed something amazing. I was getting less anxiety and depression as I continue to use it. It was around 3 grams that I noticed my anxiety and depression had completely disappeared. Of all the drugs and medication that I've tried. I would've never thought a plant that's been around for forever would be the most beneficial. So I continue to use this plant twice a day at 3 grams each dose. I feel more alive in this year alone then all my past years combined. Im am turning 28 years old this year. I feel so much regrets for having to find this plant so late in my life. When I was informed about the DEA wanting to ban and schedule this plant as a schedule 1 drug. I was in disbelief. I feel like they're taking my only means to have a better life away if they decided to continue the ban. To whom may read this, if this plant does get banned. I would continue to use it regardless of legality. They can take away my freedom but they will not make me go back into being miserable for the rest of my life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14999","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nThe DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\n\n kratom.

We all are addicted to something, be it coffee, sugar, wheat, cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, gambling or fast food. The fact is... too much of anything can be bad for you and could lead to an addiction.\n\nToo much of anything can be dangerous, for example, a person can die from drinking too much water, but the fact is nobody has died [specifically] from taking too much kratom ALONE. \n\nWhy not just regulate kratom in the same way you regulate alcohol, cigarettes and E-cigarettes which are definitely more of a health problem than kratom. The industry needs to come together to self-regulate and self-police one another and get rid of some of the bad apples out there.\n\nI support placing an age restriction on kratom for consumers who are 18 or older. I also believe that stricter labeling guidelines are necessary. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldnt use kratom, for example, and anyone with a medical condition or who is taking prescription medications should consult their doctor before trying kratom. Perhaps most importantly, make sure that products arent being deliberately marketed toward younger consumers, or with the intent of comparing its effects to other drugs, like actual opiates.\n\nKratom is a tropical plant in the coffee family from Southeast Asia that has been used to support energy and focus, as well as a potent immune system booster.  Kratom is inherently safe and shares many therapeutic constituents in common with other widely recognized medicinal plants such as Cats Claw and Yohimbe, which currently enjoy wide spread safe usage as dietary supplements in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe DEA, without a serious review of the available scientific literature, has chosen to emergency schedule Kratom and designate it as schedule I substance; one that has no accepted medical value. The common citizen can easily perform a search for Mitragyna speciosa in Google scholar and find over 1,660 search results documenting the potential medical value of Kratom.  The DEA has not only turned a blind eye to the scientific literature, but it has also taken the stance that it is uninterested in hearing testimony from Kratom users who use it for its therapeutic value.  Thus, the DEA considers any and all use of Kratom to be abuse, while ignoring the medical literature, NIH funded studies, numerous patents, and millions of users testimonies, all of which point to its therapeutic potential.\n\nRather than consider the therapeutic potential for Kratom, the DEA has unilaterally moved to make millions of felons out of Kratom users who are simply using Kratom in accordance with its historical use, its patented use, and the conclusions of thousands of scientific studies. Allowing the DEA to unilaterally criminalize the use of Kratom will not only create millions of felons out of otherwise law abiding citizens, but it will also halt all scientific investigations into Kratoms medicinal benefits which would benefit millions of other law abiding citizens.  With America currently suffering from an opiate epidemic and opiate related overdoses at an all-time high, a policy that prohibits the research of therapeutic compounds does not make sense.  \n\nFurthermore, the economic impact of the criminalization of Kratom will have unforeseen consequences due to the enforcement costs and public health costs associated with addiction such as emergency room visits due to substituting Rx medicines, petty theft to obtain said Rx medicines, etc.  Lastly, harsh penalties, such as a felony charge for possessing Kratom will not only be ineffective in preventing its use but it will also severely limit otherwise law abiding citizens future prospects for jobs, housing, voting rights, food assistance, and education, a challenge that can be permanently damaging to individuals, while costing US citizens tax revenue that is better spent on serious crime.\n\nThank You,\nWilliam Hoenigman\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6240","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Hoenigman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To who this may concern.

I oppose the DEA, FDA or any other government organization banning or scheduling of Kratom. Kratom is a safe, natural plant from the coffee family, a natural supplement that has been around for thousands of years.   I have been researching Kratom online about two years now and have seen and talked with many people who have said it has helped them with mild to moderate pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue and so much more. No one has ever died just from taking Kratom by itself. A person can not abuse Kratom or overdose on it. It does not cause respiratory depression. If a person takes too much the worse thing that happens is you can get a mild headache or vomit. I do not understand how Alcohol is legal because that is addictive, can be abused and kills 88,000 people a year or cigarettes also addictive causes 480,000 deaths a year. Why are those ok for the public but Kratom is the topic of discussion? You have the power to help or hurt the public I hope and pray you do the right thing by letting kratom remain legal and unscheduled, thank you for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19028","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Annonymous Annonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use Kratom tea for my depression.

You must understand that your attempt to banned the sales of this herb was done in haste. Most people realize what the government is and what it does--make money. Natural leaves such as Kratom cut into the sales of big money, harmful pharmaceuticals that are prescribed like candy to people who do not realize the addictive qualities of the expensive prescriptions that do more harm than good to everyone except big government's pocketbook. The attempt to ban is an example of how the government continues to overstep its boundaries. The people have spoken on this matter. To impose the will of the government on its citizens at this point, and having little care that is harming its citizens, is nothing more than a sneaky form of dictatorship.\n\nHow much research has actually been done on the positive effects of Kratom? Obviously, not very much--outside of the loss of revenue that initially drew the DEA and federal government's attention. Nobody has died from taking Kratom, unless it was paired with other, harmful substances, to that claim is an exaggeration, which is not surprising. The people who well the powers-that-be can spin information to their favor. \n\nListening to the \"I am Kratom\" movement should tell you everything you need to know. It is effective in countering the worrisome symptoms from everything from chronic back pain to PTSD. It's not a cure-all, but it helps many people make it through their day. Most striking is the fact that Kratom is not addictive. I have been a Kratom user for over a year for back pain and knee issues. I was initially prescribed Oxycontin by my family doctor, but refused it. I was aware of the addictive qualities of that poisonous drug, but some people are not. They trust their healthcare providers to direct them to the best course of treatment--however, the ease of obtaining such drugs is alarming, as far as I'm concerned. Will the government stop it? Not while it's a moneymaker. \n\nBig government is in the business of keeping the people sick--that's where profits lie. Otherwise, killer substances such as tobacco would be banned while leaves such as Kratom would be more widely available. It's all about revenue.\n\nI am currently pursing my PhD in Wellness Psychology and Holistic Healing. I would confidently recommend Kratom to any of my clients while educating them in the harmful effects of DEA-mandated \"remedies.\" I do not have confidence in knee-jerk reactions by the federal government that is based on profit rather than the well-being of its people.

I am a 27 year old male and currently employed as a commissioned sales consultant selling home appliancess. I formerly worked in the construction trade for 6 years doing concrete, the solar trade for 2 doing installations, and as an assistant retail store manager at Harbor Freight Tools for two years. I am a multiple homeowner with two paid off houses in Florida and I have worked since I was 15. I have no criminal record, driving tickets, or any blemishes on my record in any shape or form.\n\n\nIn 2013 I was hit by a car, went through the windhsield, had my arm eviscerated and right ankle broken by the force of the impact. Initially my treatment was to receive prescription vicodin (10mg), valium, and Butalbital with codeine. I have always had an aversion to taking pain medications because I have seen first hand what addiction can do to an individuals life through the addiction and subsequent death of an extended family member (uncle), the death of a friends brother due to opiates, and the long term ramifications of the death of my girlfriends mother when she was a child.\n\nI first heard of kratom after doing some internet searching for a natural pain reliever so that I could avoid taking the prescriptions I was given. This is how I discovered kratom. The tea I would make would alleviate the pain I felt without making me feel strange, groggy, or tired.  The kratom, for me, was a full on substitute for proven addictive substances and worked completely effective for my leg until it healed.  I have never experienced any adverse effects from drinking kratom tea except for mild nausea. \n\nI have ceased drinking the tea for many months at a time and never experienced any sort of withdrawal. I still drink the tea from time to time if my ankle swells or I experience severe back pain or headaches. This tea helped me and continues to help me immensely and allows me to function without even needing to take a tylenol. I strongly feel that kratom should remain available to all people because it offers people a real, working alternative to drugs that are well known to be dangerous and seems to have no potential for addiction or ability to harm.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18714","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Morgan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used atom for ten years to help control my arthritis pain.

He took care of our whole household including most of the cleaning, cooking, laundry, maintenance on the house all while working full-time and pursuing a college degree.  On top of that, we were always doing fun stuff and wrestling around.\n\nA few years ago, my mother and him were in a bad car accident while driving to dinner when they were hit my a drunk driver.  My dad's back was hurt really bad and after that, he was rarely ever the same.  You could see him sometimes have good days but he could rarely carry through finish things he started and the housework didnt always get finished.  The environment in our house completely changed as it was more stressful and less happiness.  You could see my dad get eaten away from the pain and the tension between my parents mount.  Three years after the car accident, they got divorced and I have no doubt the car accident caused it.  My dad had been taking the pain meds the doctor gave him but they kept having to give him stronger ones.  I didnt know why at the time but he was getting worse and worse, often oversleeping and not getting up in the evening to care for us.  They finally sent him away for treatment for his back although I know now it was rehab because he was using heroin.\n\nWhen he came back he was sober and in a much better mood but he still hurt really bad.  But, he started using the shredded leaf of a tree.  It looks disgusting but ever since I saw he start taking it he has slowly returned to the dad I grew up with many years ago.  He still has some bad days but now those are the few compared to the good.  He is much more active, he exercises again, he wrestles around with my little sister, he takes me out to do things, he stays on top of housework, he is always working on projects, and most of all - he started his own business and is doing well at it.  The only reason he is able to do this is because he found an oral supplement called kratom.  Without kratom, he would probably still be a shell of himself and he might have to go back to using heroin to get rid of the pain.\n\nIf you schedule kratom, I dont know what will happen to my dad.

I am writing here today to let you know the positive effects and ways Kratom has worked for me. I was addicted to pharmaceutical opiates from the time I was 18 years old. I am now 29. Last year, I decided enough was enough, but was too afraid to seek professional medical help. I was looking at different options, knowing my safest bet was something natural. With the help of Kratom. I was able to break a 10 year long opiate spell.  After so long, I thought I'd just be addicted to pills for ever. I figured for the rest of my life, I would do them.. until Kratom showed me that I could take my life back. This is one of my greatest accomplishments, and I thank God everyday that I was able to find a natural method to help me not only break free from opiates, but do so safely, smart, and get my life back. I am now opiate free, in the process of buying my own home and thinking about my future with my soon to be husband. Please, I implore you, my story is mild. Many people in the United States are still suffering from diseases and ailments that have no cure, an this is a miracle to them. They can actually get up and live life without an addiction to chemicals- please do not take that away from those people- mothers, children, brothers, sisters, fathers. So many people benefit from this natural plant, please don't take away their livlihood.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15728","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Jennifer and I work as a Companion for the elderly. I'm a single mother of 4 young children. I strongly oppose Kratom being put on the list of controlled substances. Kratom saved me from a debilitating life of pain. When I was turned down for prescriptions for any pain meds because I'm \"too young\" (33 years old), or \"just need PT again\", or \"we don't prescribe that for your diagnoses (herniated c spine discs, fibromyalgia), even though I'm allergic to meds such as Cymbalta, Lyrica, and I also have SEVERE GERD with history of peptic ulcers which nsaids exacerbate, I discovered kratom. It has been the difference between me lying in bed all day writhing in pain, contemplating suicide because of the misery I'm in constantly. It is the difference between not getting out of bed and shutting out the world or living the day to the fullest and being a good mom. I don't need it all the time or every day. I started taking it 3 years ago and I've never become physically dependent on or addicted to it. I've never experienced respiratory depression while using any type of Kratom. But on those days where my pain is severe and no amount of stretching or acetaminophen help, Kratom helps so significantly. It's positively life changing for me. I've met so many others like myself as well! Please do not take access to kratom away from people like me. If I was unable to get kratom because it became a controlled substance, I would be stuck in bed in severe pain the next time I had a flare. Flares can last for days, weeks, months even! I could see myself and others finding any way to relieve the pain, including illegally obtaining prescription pain meds or even heroin. Please don't take away access to what I and others have found to be a safe, effective treatment  for pain, and without side effects.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16025","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am on disability and am diagnosed with fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, PTSD ADD, and chronic pain for issues too numerous to mention, as well as many other issues. \nI am in long-term recovery (28 years) for alcoholism and choose to limit the amount and types of medications I take, as part of a pact I've made with myself and my sobriety.

When I began using kratom I noticed that not only does it alleviate my pain, it also gives me an energy boost very similar to coffee but it lasts longer. My work has since become much more productive and my home life has improved as well. I have read numerous reports of others like me, as well as many others who use it to quit prescription opioids and even heroin habits, which to me says that this plant might just be the answer to the deadly opiate epidemic this country is facing. There have never been any deaths attributed to kratom use alone, and it would be incredibly difficult to overdose on it.

I have never felt \"addicted\" to kratom even during intermittent periods of daily use.  I have never had difficulty stopping taking it.  I don't suffer from chronic pain but it has helped me manage occasional migraines (in addition to anxiety and trouble with sleep as I mentioned).  I do not drink alcohol or use any illegal substances, so I can't speak personally to the claims that it helps people beat harmful addictions; however, my younger brother credits it with helping him to stop drinking when other attempts to do so were unsuccessful (and he did not just switch from alcohol to kratom, but instead used it to help him get through particularly difficult days in the first few months after stopping drinking).  He now uses it only occasionally for help with sleep to the best of my knowledge.

I even took a break for about a year by simply being too busy and forgetting about it while being a student and working full time. Drinking Kratom tea to me makes me feel like I'm drinking a different type of coffee. When I say different, I mean that I feel more motivated and happy than a cup of coffee will. I have never had withdrawals or felt the need to abuse the Kratom plant.\n\nI believe it would be a step back if Kratom were to be scheduled. I have heard many stories of others taking it to stop their alcoholism or opiate addiction. Many veterans also take it not just for PTSD but also for their pain from injuries without having to be stuck on real addictive and life altering prescriptions. Please do not schedule Kratom for the future of mental and physical health of my country.

I had no access to a doctor for my sciatic nerve pain and depression and anxiety problems. I worked at a retail store which made these problems worse. Kratom was a cheap way to help get through those things for a time. I used it nearly daily for quite a long time. I had no withdrawals. In fact, even trying to take too much inevitably led to nausea. \n\nLook, DEA. You already have ridiculous draconian laws about marijuana. People can't always afford quality healthcare, even under \"Obama care\". Kratom is less intoxicating than marijuana even. Unless you somehow overcome the nausea and take a butt load, or mix it with other drugs or alcohol, which is stupid and whoever does that deserves to suffer the consequences, kratom isn't going to hurt you or turn you into a bumbling idiot. Those who have been \"addicted\" to kratom are coming off heroin or oxycodone or whatever and already have an addictive behavior pattern and opioid dependency in place. But I , nor anyone I have talked to (yes, I know, small sample size) , has formed an addiction starting from kratom itself. Why don't you guys try 500 mg to a gram or so? See for yourself. It's not a big deal. Unless you are a supporter of the nanny state or are in cahootz with the pharmaceutical companies to push opioids (which I think is aganst what you claim is the goal you have is), leave kratom alone.

I do not support classifying Kratom as a Schedule I drug. Kratom is a safe alternative to dangerous narcotics. I am battling Lyme disease right now. I experience all over body pain, numbness and tingling in limbs, insomnia, and, fatigue. I started talking kratom a few times a week about two months ago and the difference is astounding! I can sleep all night now, the pain is greatly diminished, and I have more energy.  I do not have to rely on addictive prescription narcotics any longer. \n\nKratom  tastes awful so one has to really feel bad in order to take it. I do not experience any \"high\" from karatom. Narcotics always put me in a spacey place that I didn't, and don't like. Kratom does not cause those effects. I would rather treat my pain naturally and not experience a high then have to take a synthetic, manufactured chemical that is addictive and causes changes in my thinking patterns. \n\nPlease keep kratom off the scheduled 1 drug list. Marijuana was placed on this list in 1970 only \"temporarily\" while the DEA could study it and kratom has, to this day, NOT come off that list. Any substance placed on the schedule 1 list comes under the authority of the government, and only the government can approve who studies it.  That is why so few strides have been made in the study on medicinal marijuana. If kratom is placed on this list the usage of narcotics to treat pain will skyrocket, and as prescription narcotics fall under more stringent rules, the illegal narcotic trade will prosper. \nKEEP KRATOM LEGAL!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4123","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Ms.","postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"T Adams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After an amount of time I've heard referred to as a \"millennium\", if there were any critical issues attached to Kratom the human race should know about them by now.\n\nI am a 44 year old woman who's worked in a casino for 12 years.\n \nAbout 4 years ago I developed carpal tunnel in both my wrists, restless leg syndrome, plantar fasciitis in both my feet, eczema on my feet and hands, and i've also been diagnosed with early premenopause.\n \nKratom has all but eliminated all of the symptoms except my menopause. But i'm not nearly as moody and the insanity is much easier to cope with.  I know that the problems are still there because if i push myself too hard physically or emotionally, the symptoms of one or all of my problems do mildly kick in. Nothing i can't handle though.\n\nWith zero side effects. Pretty impressive.\n\nIt's changed my life. There is nothing in the pharmaceutical market that I can safely take for any length of time  without causing more problems. I think by now we all know what the pharmaceutical meds are about. It's sad, but true. And you, the fda, and all the professionals in charge of controlling these man-made or altered substances do know how harmful they are. Even if used correctly. (I've never gotten into the whole marijuana thing. Just not for me so I don't know about that so much)\n\nWithout Kratom I don't know if I would be able to get out of bed anymore. There was a time when it was tough, as my symptoms are severe and relentlessly progressive.  I'm NOT exaggerating.\n \nAfter searching the internet for every possible remedy I could think of and doing a ton of research on kratom, I finally broke down and tried Kratom. The results were to good to be true. I wonder everyday if the next day all my symptoms will be back, but kratom has never let me down.\n \nAfter a little trial and error, i've figured out how to use it in a way that it works perfectly for me. Everyone is different.\n \nI wouldn't worry about the junkies getting hold of it and abusing it or trying to commit suicide with it alone. Kratom simply will not kill you unless you, maybe, plug your nose, mouth and ears with it. (try to suffocate yourself) Or maybe shove it up your butt to stop yourself up? No..you'd just poopy it out.\n \nIt's not worth it for them. It's not a \"Good-Time\" drug. If you use it wrong, it will just make you feel awful for a few hours. If you take too much, you will feel awful for a few hours. That's all.\n\nJunkies want more than kratom could ever provide them. And I've had that said to me, by a few junkies. They say,\"Don't even mess with that crap(kratom). Here's some hydrocodone. Or how about some heroine?\"  And I was so miserable I actually started to believe that I might be able to control those drugs to help me. I'm glad I came to my senses, and never tried any of those things. With my personality, I would be dead by now.\n\nOnto the \"looking for the evil in the Kratom\". I couldn't find any. None. You can't mix and match your meds with it, i'm guessing. But it's the meds causing the problem, not the Kratom. The people would have died without the kratom in their system. Meds killing a human being is not uncommon, now is it?\n\nSince nobody has been able to find any \"evil\" in kratom after hundreds of years,  might I suggest you leave it alone? That's it. Just leave it alone. \nLet it go.\n \nOr else, whatever you do, do you really have to \"ban\" it? Kratom has been around for hundreds of years. Somebody, somewhere would've said something. Maybe it's just not as bad as you want it to be. \nOnce again. Please. Leave it alone.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21834","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have seen my daughter's life be turned around because of this plant.

I was consumed with self hatred. I didn't want to wake up ever. I had many failed rehab attempts, maintenance programs and drug overdoses. Being saved in a hospital only to leave again and stick a needle right back into my arm hoping the next time I would leave this miserable world. It wasn't until a friend shared her knowledge of Kratom with me that I would begin to show some signs of possibly living and not just a mere existence of suffering. I thought it would be another failed attempt like Suboxone or Methadone where my days were spent nodding off but it was so different. My anxiety to use became almost non existent until one day it was just gone. I found a great job and I started to become a productive member of society. I started to enjoy even the mundane tasks of life. Kratom has saved me in so many ways. It has saved my children who see me as a mother now who they can depend on. I am a good friend to others and people can count on me. It is nothing short of miraculous. My story is just one of so many. I use Kratom tea three times daily and the thought of it becoming illegal while it has helped so many people recover from this deadly disease is so confusing to me.

For over 30 years I have suffered from migraines, back pain due to degenerated discs, IBS, anxiety and depression. I have spent thousands of dollars and too much time at doctor's offices with little to no relief. About 7 months ago, I decided to try Kratom, thanks to friends and a pain support group. Kratom has changed my life! For the first time in over 30 years, I am pain free and drug free. I am able to spend time going places with my family, play with my grandchildren and I now have a job that I can work at pain-free. All of the medications I have taken over the years have not helped or had adverse side effects. Kratom has no side effects and contrary to what some people are saying, it is NOT addictive and you can NOT get \"high\" from it. The only logical reason to ban Kratom would be to give the big Pharma's the opportunity to capitalized on it, use it in drugs that would have potential side effects and would only benefit them.

I would like to ask the DEA to re-consider banning kratom as I believe it may be a very useful plant with great potential. I am 51 with severe arthritis with narrowing of joint spaces in shoulder, hips, spine and knees. I contracted CFS from the Epstein Barr virus (while I was in hospital for C-section with my youngest son) I have never been the same since getting cfs. I was prescribed tramadol which does help with pain somewhat, but is a nightmare of a drug. My Dr left the practice and I was given a much lower dose. I've tried to get off of it several times as it is a horrible drug(the tramadol)..but the withdrawal (taken as directed)matches symptoms of heroin withdrawal plus anti-depressant withdrawal.  If it was just a week or 2 I would have been off it yrs ago, but I once went 2 months and was still sick as a dog and bed-ridden, non productive, that I had no choice and had to get back on the garbage. My CFS exascerbates it. So for both the CFS and at another time, getting off the monster drug tramadol I went online to see what could possibly help CFS symptoms and how to make getting off tramadol any better and for both conditions, I read comments that Kratom helps alot with both.  I purchased some - 3 different strains - in desparation that 1 would help. I did not notice much, but thought I may not because I understand it acts on opiate receptors in the brain. Ever since I've been on tramadol I have noticed it is a complete opiate blocker. Some people on tramadol it completely blocks opiates for them, others it does not. For me it does,That alone is scary. What happens when I break a hip (I am loaded with arthritis) 2 yrs ago I had to have emergency gallbladder removal surgery, due to tramadol in my system for so many yrs, the hospital couldn;t break through and control the pain. Did not even feel the morphine, still had crushing chest pain, finally the dilauded kicked in.  I still have the kratom. I keep it for an emergency. If I ever decide to get off tramadol again, I understand it may help. During CFS moments, that are worse than others, I'd just like to know It will be available to me as so many say it helps with both my problems so much. Right now the tramadol blocks kratoms efficiency for me, but I may need in future. From what I have read about Kratom and it's users it's not dead head druggies looking to get a high/thrill....it's people like me, middle age people with serious health conditions who are just looking for pain relief so we can function and work and walk without pain.  Also, people like me who were put on tramadol being told it was non addictive, and now suffer withdrawal from even the slightest change in dosage. I am sick of feelimg like a criminal even just having to call my Dr's office every month for a tramadol refill. I'd love to not have to take it but the pain level without it is unbearable and any time I try to get off, the pain multiplies and is so severe I cannot move or go to myjob  I've been there 2 yrs and dont want to lose it.  I ve been thinking kratam will be my answer when my 30 day rx doesnt get filled until day 32 (often happens and then i suffer)   My shoulder x-rays are so bad, I've been told they normally only see that in severe trauma or x football players,  I qualify for disability based on my shoulder xrays alone.  Tramadol really isnt even strong enough, I should be on true narcotic meds, so I get so mad that all the drug abusers out there have made it almost impossible for people in pain like me to get adaquate relief,   Just typing this much, I will be stiff as heck and in pain for hours to come today and probably tomorrow too,,,but DEA needs to hear our voices.

I then graduated to stealing my mothers pain meds while living with her and any time I would visit her after moving out. To make a long story much much shorter, By the year 2000 I was doctor shopping at all the favorite pill mills in Florida and was up to 240-10/325 norcos per month. In 2006 I was involved in a hit-and-run crash where I t-boned a van going 40mph...he drove away while my car started to smoke. Somebody(guardian angel) broke out the drivers window and pulled me out right before the car started on fire, With 3 broken ribs, a fractured arm, and a bruised heart I spent 2 days in the cardiac unit and the pain train of meds rolled along! They loaded me full of pain medication that I couldn't even pronounce and I loved every minute, even with my injuries. Well, needless to say, my life really tanked after that. I was snorting roxies that I stole to get and ended up homeless and living in a \"tent city\".By the grace of God on September 5th 2011 I came out of my stupor long enough to look up and ask God to help me, a God that I blamed for everything that went wrong in my life...and HE did!! I knew I was done drinking and drugging myself to death, which was inevitable! I was \"lucky\" enough to get a bed in a residential recovery program back in Wisconsin and I knew that this is where God intended me to be. A year later I left the program, got a great job and eventually bought a car, got my own place and was loving life! About a year after that I started feeling pain that I couldn't stand...the injuries from that hit-and-run were rearing their ugly heads. Oh, the doctor I went to was more that happy to prescribe any kind of pain med that I wanted, but I couldn't go back down that road because death was waiting for me if I did. I started surfing the web on natural pain medication,and what do you suppose I found? KRATOM! I didn't research a hell of a lot because I was in so much pain! I found a vendor on Amazon and I bought my first 4 ounces of kratom...it was a red for pain and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! I did a perfect choke and spray all over the kitchen counter and myself trying my first dose!! I wasn't going to let that deter me!! When I was able to finally get about 1/2tsp. in my system, the \"magic\" happened! My pain went from a 10 to a 4 almost immediately and I knew that God had blessed me with His plant, His herb, His natural medicine! That was over 2-1/2 years ago...KRATOM saved me! I will go down fighting for this God-given natural plant that He placed on this earth for our benefit!! I will NOT give up what has made me whole again! I was facing my later years with a cane or a walker, or even a wheelchair! I am a 63 year old male and I choose to supplement myself with a God given alternative to narcotics! Without the prescribed medication in my life,I can see,hear,and think straight and no longer have to live in a medicated \"fog\". The decision that you make will be the deciding factor on how many people end up dying bcause they have no choice but to return to the narcotics that helped them to become addicted...please do the right thing and leave this living,growing herb alone!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0763","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 30 year old woman from Massachusetts with an excellent career, a husband, and a wonderful family. I suffer from mild anxiety and have scoliosis. The everyday pain from a 40 degree thoracic curve lead me to speak with my family practitioner. I was prescribed physical therapy, massage therapy, and after trying many things, a low dose opioid pain management therapy. Even though my condition was tolerable, I was never comfortable being on that pain management program. I am very well aware of the epidemic that is sweeping our country. I would stand in line at the pharmacy and be so embarrassed. I could see them asking questions and judging me every month. I actually felt shameful for seeking help. I began to look at alternatives on the internet and came across Kratom. I asked my husband if he was okay with me trying it and we made sure it is legal in Mass. I placed an order and was interested to give it a try. I am so happy I did. Kratom provides the same \"body effects\" as my low dose opioid therapy, but without the grogginess, drowsiness, or cognitive dullness. It actually felt like I had a small cup of coffee. My body and back no longer ached with dull and shooting pains. I had energy to get things done, and actually experienced a huge decrease in anxiety. It was an absolute miracle in my life. I don't feel like I'm at the mercy of the opiate anymore. So many people get addicted to prescription pain meds and they are terrified of stopping because of the withdrawals. Kratom completely eliminated opioid withdrawal symptoms and is in no way as addictive.  I completely believe Kratom could be used to help addicts quit both pharmaceutical and street highs. It would be incredibly tragic if our government banned a plant that could alleviate the current opiate epidemic. Please don't take this alternative away. \nPlease listen to the people that have been helped by this plant. Please compare all overdose statistics between Kratom and other opiates. Please give people a chance for a comfortable and lasting recovery from their addictions. Please let people like me continue to use this plant to help eliminate legitimate pain and anxiety so we can continue to be productive members of society. Please keep Kratom legal.\n\nThank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17493","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a chronic infection with borrelia bergdorferi and undoubtedly co-infections commonly acquired from tick bites.  Over the past several years I have suffered several classic symptoms of lyme disease and treated them with varying degrees of success.\n\nTwo years ago I began to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis which rapidly damaged the connective tissues of my knees, elbows and jaw.  The autoimmune response involved the failure of my lymphatic system and severe edema in the legs.  Both conditions were extremely painful.  \n\nDuring the worst period of symptoms I was able to use kratom as a pain reliever.  NSAID's did not alleviate the pain or swelling and I am not comfortable taking toxic and addictive opioids, which my doctor will not prescribe in any case.  With minimal side effects (slight nausea, irritability) the kratom powder I used was very effective at relieving severe pain in my joints and legs.  Where the dangerous dose of four ibuprofen had no effect, about a half gram of kratom considerably lessened my pain and seemed to ameliorate inflammation as well.

This kind of arbitrary scheduling of natural substances, coupled with the approval of dangerously addictive drugs like opioids, has ruined the legitimacy of the entire prohibition regime.  \n\nKratom should not be scheduled as a drug, though the DEA and FDA should certainly reconsider the regime that has pushed millions into addiction through use of dangerous approved pharmaceuticals while subjecting millions of others to prosecution for the use of relatively harmless plants.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1793","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Clifford Phillips","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be added to the schedule of controlled substances.

I suffer from selective catatonic depression and anxiety that keeps me from working at all. I am also diagnosed with extreme OCD.  My General Practitioner who is very careful and very watchful put me on an SSRI and anti anxiety medication.  Sometimes it works, but most of the time it doesn't. I discovered Kratom a year ago and over time, I felt like myself again.  I could work, create, own a business and maintain it.  I do not care for the acting head of the DEA for I fear he knows nothing if little about true botany.  Kratom helps my depression and anxiety.  I'm a medical buff for some reason and know a lot about human physiology and can tell you Kratom is 99.5% safe with little or no side effects.  Can big pharmaceuticals, that I feel personally are behind this move, say the same efficacy and safety rate for their drugs they push on us.  No, they can not.  The medicine the Dr, prescribed ran the continuous risk of many serious side effects including, but not limited to liver, heart and kidney damage.  Just watch the television pharmaceutical commercials and listen to the end speaker about the dangers of say Cymbalta or Lyrica - both can cause cancer! \n\nKratom is a safe leaf, a  medicinal herb used for thousands of years and 1000 medically recorded years.  It is American arrogance to think the Asian doctors didn't keep good records of the efficacy and possible danger of Kratom.  It fights and cures depression, anxiety, pain and miraculously enough drug and alcohol withdrawal within a week!  How many western clinics can say that!??!  So what does the DEA want to ban it so fast!?! Because of only 660 calls to the PCC in the last 5 years and does not constitute an epidemic when 99 percent of the calls were nausea, dizziness, fever (mild symptoms) and physiologically speaking Kratom probably isn't for everyone. The PCC gets over 100 calls a day from kids swallowing detergent.  What? Ban detergent?!!  Is it because of the 16-25 death in which Kratom was involved?  What else were the subjects on at the the time?  Blaming Kratom in an uncontrolled study is like blaming the peanut butter sandwich the person had in the morning.  If death was so prominent, than many, many more would be heard.   The fact is, one can not overdose on Kratom as a heavy, heavy dose will make someone sick and regurgitate.  Kratom is safe and by the very comparison of banning Kratom, should not we ban sugar, salt, fat, meat, caffeine, alcohol with over 175,000 (usually 5-year survival rate) of liver cirrhosis every year from Alcohol.  Cigarettes cause cancer plane and simple in a majority of chronic users.  Aspartame is legal and look at how many subjective anecdotes of serious side effects have come from Aspartame which when heated can create an excitotoxin that can make a person very ill.   \n\nThe ban on Kratom to schedule 1 ruling without a 4-5 year imperial data study with absolute controlled tests, is highly unwarranted, dangerous, irresponsible and deadly decision for millions of suffering Americans.  Two years ago, October 2014, it was decided that low level painkillers with opiates now be placed on a schedule II versus schedule III thanks to the thousands of abusers who would have abused something else anyway while now millions of Americans suffer horribly and I pray none of you reading this get the pain I have seen.  Doctors are furious and scared to their jobs thanks to the DEA.  My wife got sick with bronchitis 2 years ago.  She hates opiates.  She could not talk as she had a serious flue going around.  She asked her long time doctor for 1 small bottle of codeine syrup and told her she did not want to get in trouble the the DEA.  So now Dr's can not do their jobs. My wife due to the refusal dislodged her jaw due to violent, profuse coughing.  We had to see a maxifallacial surgeon after I told her to fire her Dr.  My wife is 51.  She is developing serious jaw issues.   Since the 2014 ruling heroine has seen an historic rise in comeback - up 147% and climbing!  \n\nThe result I fear of banning Kratom is many Americans will switch to dangerous drugs and alcohol.  They have to, to survive.  I don't know what it will take to get the DEA to back off and understand Kratom is harmless and the numbers aren't there after years of Americans safely taking Kratom with no side effects and no need for liver damaging pharmasueticals like statins.   Kratom is not bath salts or synthetic marijuana.  The DEA is just looking to keep their jobs as marijuana is about be legalized but what about all of the other seriously dangerous drugs on the streets the DEA SHOULD worrry about, meth, crack, cocaine.  Many are saying this seems political and that this move is prompted by big pharmasueticals bribing and an agency.  Please, plesae do not let the DEA destroy millions of lives by banning a safe herb.

Nearly 10 years ago, I had a medical emergency that changed my body forever. My kidneys shut down and my blood pressure dropped to the point where they were not sure if I was going to make it or not. After a partial recovery it was evident that my body would not be the same.I was in chronic pain for months with no diagnosis. I have been to about 15 specialists and I still have minimal answers. I have tried so many different medical procedures to try to stop the pain I now live with on a daily basis and I was so desperate to feel better, that I nearly gave away my life savings to a provider who promised to cure me. I have taken most of the medications on the market, and they either stop working or I have an allergic reaction to them. Recently I have been put on an off label medication that alters the brain neurotransmitters, but it is an opiate antagonist. In order to be able to try this medication, so I could try to stop the pain/sleep cycle, I had to stop taking opiate medication. I had been taking them for years off and on, and they never really changed the underlying pain, but made it possible for me to continue to work and care for my family. \n\nSince the DEA crackdown on opiates, it has been very hard to find a doctor who is willing to treat, legitimately diagnosed people. With that option being ruled out, I had been reading about natural treatment. Because I still work, medical marijuana- legal at the state level, is not an option for me. There has not been enough case law to establish if an employer can terminate an employee if using it with medical purpose. I have been using Kratom for about 3 weeks. The first dose I took had no effect on me. I did not feel funny or high. Through research, I ended up increasing my dose to about a teaspoon to a tablespoon a day depending on how my body was feeling. It has no interactions with my other medications, I felt no ill side effects (Aside from the not so wonderful taste) and I felt no impairment in my fine motor skills or added cognitive dysfunction. There is no \"high\", and my pain is significantly reduced. With only 3 weeks under my belt, I feel that my exploration phase is not as optimum as someone who has been using it longer. With that being said, if this is banned, it will prevent me from determining if this is a viable option for my chronic illness. I want to work, I want to be able to go to family events, but without options it is more likely than not, that my physical well being will significantly deteriorate over a short time frame. I know many who are bed bound, and cannot provide, or even go to the mail box. I do not want to be that kind of burden to my family. I know my comments do not have medical or scientific backing, but I can say that I am pretty in tune with my body and Kratom is pretty much the only thing that has helped me in a very long time. I understand there may be a growing consensus that wants it regulated or even ban it because it is hard to confirm quality and safety, but as long as supplements and essential oils are still available for purchase, the same kind of experimentation will continue. I help run a support group with 22k members that have all different types of chronic illness, and I can say, with 100% certainty, none of us want to be broken. My condition was not caused by a poor life choice or because I did bad things to others, it is in my DNA. Had I known that I would be chronically ill in my adulthood I may have not chosen to continue to exist. I do realize my purpose in life now, but I really want the chance to do things and experience life for as long as possible. I have lost my ability to walk at times. I have joints and ligaments that do as they choose, and I can do nothing to control them. Please have compassion for those of us, and there are a lot of us, who live with pain every moment of every day. With every breath we breathe, we want to be just like everyone else, and without options- we are lost.

I tried and failed rehab 3 times before discovering stories of Kratom. I decided I would give it a try since I didn't feel I had anything to lose, my situation was hopeless. I'm not exaggerating when I say it is the best thing that has ever happened to me. From day one of using Kratom I never fell back into the trap of deadly opiates. The detox period from the heroin was almost painless with Kratom which is a completely different experience from the absolute misery I had experienced every other time I tried to quit using. I felt better than I had in recent memory, I had hope that I could turn my life around and be a productive member of society again for the first time in a long time. Kratom worked beautifully for me. To say that it saved my life would be no exaggeration. I decided that I would do everything I could to share the knowledge of this plant that was a miracle for me with as many people as I could that were going through the fight I went through to try to save myself from opiates. I have shared information with hundreds of addicts about Kratom. I've ran into some of these people weeks later and they hug me and cry and thank me for saving there life. but I didn't save there life. A 100% natural herbal leaf did. I have no doubt I would be either dead or incarcerated today if I hadn't discovered this plant. I haven't touched opiates in almost 3 years and continue to use kratom to manage pain, high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression. there have been a number of times when I didn't need kratom for a number of days or weeks and felt no effects of withdrawal or any desire to use Kratom again until I need to. Without it I am scared to death I will again turn to opiates to treat my chronic pain from an old knee injury and fall back into a life that can only lead to prison or death. I beg you please don't take away the plant that has saved my life and the lives of thousands of other Americans. In the 3 years I've used kratom I've felt absolutely no ill effects of any kind. I feel it would be irresponsible to ban a plant for which no evidence has been provided of any harmful effects and so much evidence of peoples lives being saved does exist. Thank you for giving the people a forum to share these type of stories and thank you for considering this action and not just giving in to big pharma who is killing thousands of people every year with their poison.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11245","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Smart","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop attempting to make this leaf illegal.

I found Kratom after a long and painful battle with Depression, GAD and ADHD. I started out just dealing with my issues without any sort of medication prescribed by doctors. After my marriage, starting a business, and becoming a home owner I found that the mental health issues I had suffered with for so long needed addressing. I began with visiting my family doctor who prescribed an antidepressant and a minor tranquilizer. My family doctor referred me to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist switched my antidepressant and put me on a daily amount of Ativan. I continued on this way for about a year, then switched psychiatrists because my insurance changed and was no longer accepted by my provider. My new psychiatrist switched me to a new antidepressant until i went through every known SSRI and SNRI. When this proved futile, I was given a prescription for Ritalin. The Ritalin was prescribed daily and with it Xanax. The Ritalin caused aggression issues that I never had before so the doctor switched me to Adderall first, then Adderall XR I couldn't sleep and was up every night for a month. The doctor then put me on Clonazepam daily with the Adderall XR and the antidepressant and included Temazepam so I could fall asleep. This story went on for a year or two until I became so messed up from all the chemicals I had been prescribed that I ended up being forced into a mental ward by my family while my wife left me and my business crumbled under my feet. I lost my house I lost everything. What absolutely blew my mind is that on leaving the mental ward after a month-long stint, they had me back on everything that I was originally placed into the mental ward for.  I was forced to continue all these horrible pills until my family deemed me safe to myself. In secret I threw out every single pill I had and was supposed to be taking and decided I would just go back to suffering in silence like it was before the mess had began. After two years of searching for something to handle my issues that was not a drug or prescription I stumbled on Kratom. I have not drank, done drugs, been to a medical doctor, had issues with anxiety, depression, or ADHD since starting with the natural herb Kratom. It does not cause a high. IT REMOVES THE DESIRE TO GET HIGH. It has been 5 years since touching a drink or any drug legal or illegal. I have my life back without the mental health issues I once had. My life was destroyed by trusting modern day medicine, and my life was RESTORED to a place better than it ever has been from a leaf growing on a tropical evergreen tree in the coffee genus. To remove this plant from people who suffer and struggle with things like depression and addiction is worse than murder because the living have to deal with suffering the dead do not. At no point in my 5 years of using Kratom have I ever had an adverse reaction or undesirable side effect. My dosage and use is the exact same as it was when I started 5 years ago. I have gone without Kratom for weeks, even months at a time with no ill effects other than the return of my depression ADHD, and anxiety symptoms which are immediately resolved by resuming my regular Kratom dose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1509","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Shaun Hawkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"  I am not sure if my life would be the same without Kratom.

Before that, my wife used Kratom for her severe chronic arthritis pain. I had routine panic attacks and anxiety flare ups, depression that crippled my attempts at a normal life. I didn't have the energy to get out of the house, and my fear of failure and inertia to stay inside and avoid pain and suffering ground my life to a halt. \nI was ruined. \nThen Kratom came into my life. My wife told me about it, let me use it. She told me about making sure to stick to the ground leaf and not the extract and that way I would avoid any sort of addiction potential. \na half tablespoon of ground leaf two to three times a day helped make my anxiety, depression, and PTSD meds work better giving me the edge I needed to remain a productive, healthy, thriving member of society and of the economy. Kratom saved my livelihood and helped make me a better person. \nTo take something away from legal aged, sound minded, and consenting adults because of loosely corroborated conjecture and correlation of drug presence made out to be at best flimsy brittle evidence is not just unreasonable, it is unconscionable and just flat out Wrong, especially from a member of the American government whose power derives from the consent of the governed.

I am a 54 year old successful business woman (small business with a full time employee).  wife and mother of 2 teenage kids.  I have been taking Kratom for 5 years, and it has been instrumental in keeping me going through a crippling depression.  \n\nAfter being sidelined with depression and anxiety around 5 years ago,  My doctor began prescribing me a series of antidepressants.  I could not tolerate the way these drugs made me feel.  it turned me into a zombie, and i could not do my job properly.  I began researching online, looking for a natural alternative to help me through this difficult time... I needed to keep going with my work for the sake of my family.  \n\nI began taking moderate doses of Kratom daily and it has transformed me from a sad and non-productive person to a high functioning member of society.  This herb has helped me and so many people.  Through online forums I have heard hundreds of stories of Kratom helping people much worse off than me get their lives back together.  There are a huge amount of people that have used this to get off of opioids, including heroin. It has amazing benefits for people sidelined by painful conditions, too.  \n\nScheduling this herb is completely counterproductive to the war in drugs.  If you truly want to help people, you will let this plant remain legal. The only reason I can see that anyone would want this plant banned is because the pharmaceutical industry is pushing  the ban for its own agenda.  There is absolutely no downside to  letting people detox off of Heroin and pharmaceutical drugs with this herb.  There is no way to OD on Kratom, these people must have also taken other drugs.  Please keep it legal, and let real research be done.  I am convinced that Kratom cam help so may people and in its natural form, is way better than anything that can be produced from it by a drug company.  \n\n I would be happy to talk with you or anyone about my 5 years using this herb and how much it has helped me.  I am extremely healthy, get checked every year and have had no problems at all.. no blood pressure issues, no cholesterol no diabetes, no liver issues.    I believe this herb is about as harmful as a cup of coffee, but its benefits are huge.  \n\nThanks, \n\nDiane Pollock","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8237","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diane Pollock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using kratom for almost three years now.

I cried all the time and had severe anxiety attacks.. I was tired all the time. The medications for these were horrible with terrible side effects. Heart racing, sleepy, sweating, and mind racing. The depression medication made me need more anxiety medication and that made me sleepy and more depressed. I needed to keep being a productive member of society but couldn't do that anymore.

I feel I have the right to only put natural things in my body. I have the right to drink teas that calm and coffee to help with energy. Kratom is no more harmful than tea.  It didn't cure my mental illnesses but I was back to a functional happy caring energetic person who didn't cry all the time. It had no side effects like the depression medications and anxiety medications and no high. I just felt like I normally should.  Don't I have the right to feel normal by living naturally? Please do not schedule Kratom or anything in the kratom leaf. It has been used for thousands of years for medicinal purposes. There is no proof that any deaths have been caused by Kratom alone.

I became very depressed with my life because I was missing out on my entire life due to health problems. I was even suicidal and admitted into the hospital many times because of this. After ten years of struggling to even get a diagnosis, I found out that I have an iatrogenic condition called red skin syndrome. It is a condition caused by Topical steroid creams (even OTC) used for eczema and other skin issues, as well as prednisone. As soon as I found out, I started topical steroid withdrawal in June of 2014. \nMy symptoms progressed and I quite literally looked like I had third degree burns from head to toe. Completely raw, burnt skin. I became bedridden and could not care for myself at all. I couldn't shower, do laundry, eat on my own, or even move. I was crying and screaming in pain every single day. I needed assistance for everything. \nAfter suffering like this for a while, since I couldn't be treated with the same pharmaceutical treatments that caused my condition, I started looking into natural alternatives.\nThat's when my friend introduced me to kratom and I decided to try it after extensive research. I discovered that not only does it help relieve pain, but depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and i could even use it as an alternative for the creams and bath products. Imagine being covered with third degree burns on 100% of your body - that's what RSS/TSW is like. Kratom helped make it more bearable. I'm still suffering, but it pales in comparison to the beginning. I was bedridden for 18 months and now am able to work again and be a productive member of society once again. \n For those of us like me, who have NO choice but to only use natural remedies, this is detrimental. Everyone deserves due process when decisions which would impact hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives are being made. We have a right to choose nature over synthetics. This ban would ruin millions of lives. Please leave kratom alone and do not schedule it. \nThank you for taking the time to read my story, I hope you will take it into consideration.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11224","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Congratulations on your sound decision to get more input on kratom -- I think you will find that this is a plant whose use should be supported, promoted and developed, not criminalized or restricted.\n\nLike so many others who have posted comments, kratom has gotten me off pain pills, addressing both chronic pain and addiction, and eliminating the problems associated with the latter. For close to 30 years, I have struggled with the use of narcotic pain medication (and for a while, with heroin) and only since kratom came into my life have these troubles seemed to end for good. I have been taking kratom daily now for about a year -- it allows me to enjoy exercise and feel great despite serious troubles with my knees and joints. I have not refilled my oxycodone prescription in that time, and at 58, am in the best shape of my life. \n\nI have a friend who used kratom to give up an alcohol addiction that was very close to killing her and others. After a serious DUI, she stopped drinking, and with the help of kratom, has been sober for a year.\n\nBig Pharma has a lot to answer for already vis a vis the marketing of opiates (Dreamland by Sam Quinones provides an excellent history of this) so I hope that industry is not behind the initiative to schedule and criminalize kratom. So many lives have been lost to oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin, etc. It is almost impossible to hurt yourself with kratom.

Kratom has been used by humans safely for centuries for a variety of reasons.  It can give a temporary boost to motivation & energy; it helps improve the moods associated with depression & anxiety & it can helps alleviate pain in some people. \n \nI am a single mom who is facing various health challenges.  I had emergency Spinal fusion surgery at 8 months pregnant that left me mobility impaired & in Chronic pain from neuropathy & other nerve damage. Luckily my daughter was born healthy, via C-section, just 2 weeks after the spinal surgery. After the first 2 years of physical therapy I went from needing a walker to just using a cane, but the simplest of things that I took for granted have become major hurdles.  I constantly deal with numbness, tingling, heaviness & pain from the waist down & also in my neck, back & both hands.  I am NEVER truly comfortable.  I spent several years being a guinea pig  for every type of pain treatment & therapy, most of which didnt work at all or gave terrible side effects. Drs agree I am unlikely to improve unless there are significant medical breakthroughs.  As is common for Spinal injuries, the toll on my body resulted in Fibromyelgia diagnosis about 5 years ago; I have multiple strategies to cope with the pain, exhaustion, mobility & mental health issues including medication, acupuncture or massage when I can afford it, swimming as therapy; and various vitamin, mineral & herbal supplements. If this were not enough to cope with as a single mother, I am also a recovering long-term heroin addict.  Ive been compliant & successful in Methadone Maintenance Treatment for the past 11 years.  When after many failed attempts at recovery I finally decided to turn my life around from the drug addiction, Methadone was 1 of the very few options available to me as effective pharmacologic treatment.  Now there are more- Suboxone, Vivitrol, others I don't know about. And as I recently found out, there is Kratom.  While Methadone literally saved my life it is not without significant drawbacks; physical dependency & the restrictive prescribing requirements that force me to obtain my medicine in a clinic rather than a pharmacy are 2 of them. The physical & mental discomfort associated with withdrawal is another.  Although Ive been slowly weaning down my dose I have been overwhelmed at the prospect of actually getting off of Methadone.  Even in the best of circumstances its a huge challenge, & my chronic pain & no one to help me take care of my daughter or self during the worst of it has held me back from going for it.  With Kratom, I feel like it might finally be possible.  I am hearing success after success stories of people getting off of Narcotic pills, Suboxone & yes- Methadone, with much less discomfort than a typical WD.  I have read very little in the way of negative effects; any I have seen pale in comparison to the side effects of some of my medications even.  I believe people should have the right to make our own decisions regarding  what we do or dont put into our own bodies.  On the range of things out there that could hurt us- like Tide Laundry pods for instance, or, if you are talking about supplements- all those diet pills & energy boosters aggressively marketed at us,  Kratom should not even register on the radar.  The methods you employed trying to institute the ban were highly suspect.  How, if there is no medicinal value to Kratom, are scientists isolating & requesting a PATENT on,  the very alkaloids you are trying to put on schedule 1?  The DEA should focus more on stopping the actual illicit drugs that are harming people from coming in to the country & leave something like Kratom, an unrefined unprocessed TREE LEAF, alone!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17728","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Julie Wickware","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please strongly consider no banning this important plant.

I am in constant pain, I lose feeling in my right hand and foot because of pinched nerves and I still work 40-60 Hrs a week only because of Kratom. \n I began taking prescription medications at 28 years of age and found Kratom at 32, I was able to stop taking all of my prescriptions, quit pain management and did this with Kratom alone with almost no withdrawal symptoms. I have had multiple steroidal injections in my spine and have to have cortisone injections in both mt knees every 6 months. \n The medication I had to take to function daily was unreal and it caused other negative side effects. When I stopped taking medication I was on morphine 30 mg x 2 per day, Hydrocodone 10 mg x 4 times a day, Ibuprofen 800 mg x 3 per day, Xanax 1 mg x 2 per day because of the side effects, also 350mg Soma per day and 2-3 Lidoderm patches and Voltaren gel for my knees. I have also been prescribed Percocet, Nucynta Er and Tramadol  50mg x 4.\n Now I have been free of any and all narcotic pain medication for 2+ years. I take kratom daily, my pain is kept to a tolerable level almost all the time. I find it is more effective, lasts longer and I have never had any side effects from it. I have never got any kind of high from it, I keep a clear and focused mind and it truly has saved my life. I was extremely depressed,  taking anti depressant and my quality of life was very poor. \n Please, Kratom has changed my life and I never want to go back to pain medication. I am pleading,  do not ban this herb, I know so many people it has helped and I have tried to spread the word and help others with advice and samples. This is a miracle for so many people and to ban it would only make the opiate epidemic so much worse. \n Thank you from the bottom of my heart for hearing my testimony, I pray that you hear our plea for your help.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8411","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ian Bradford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA official,\n\nI respectfully submit my opposition to the proposed rule above.

I understand your concern about this substance but take it from someone that won't even eat cheetos because of the health consequences, kratom is safe. I have been able to live a highly productive and happy life with it and I beg for you to hear me out.

I suffer from fibromyalgia and migraines, and have arthritis in my left hip and cervical spine. The doctors had me on opiates. I was taking hydrocodone 10/325's, 1 or 2 every 6 hours, 7 days a week, every week, every month and could not miss one dose because the pain is debilitating. I've been in healthcare for 18 years and I take care of patients so I can't just find a desk job.\n\nI couldn't do my job. I couldn't function. The pain never went away and so I was either in pain and nauseous all the time or laid out unable to get out of bed. Then I found kratom 3 years ago. \n\nI take it only twice a day. The first time I took it, it actually completely eradicated my pain. Gone. It was the best night's sleep I'd had in years. I take it in the morning and begin my day. I'm able to move and twist, bend and stretch. I move more slowly than my 30 year old daughter but I can do it. I just finished moving house today and I packed the house. There's no way I could have done that without kratom. It allows me to work. It doesn't get me high at all and doesn't interfere with my decision making. I take my second dose at night so that I can sleep without waking up because of spasms and pain. I sleep and rest. I can hold my granddaughters where before, I couldn't even stand at the sink long enough to do the dishes. I can walk in the park across from my house and exercise again which only contributes to my health. Without kratom, I can barely move. With it, I can really live.\n\nPlease, do not schedule this plant or it's components. It's given me back my life.

I am a 22 year old male who struggles with anxiety and a lack of motivation. Kratom is a supplement that elevates my mood, and gets me in a headspace where I can be creative, social, and much more happy with my day to day routines. \n\nServing tables at a restaurant is my day job. It's often monotonous work where you meet up to 50+ strangers a night, which has been difficult for me over the past 4 years. When I take a low dose of Kratom before a shift, I become motivated, ready to make money and connect with these wonderful customers that come into my work. It helps provide me with a positive attitude that I lacked before I discovered this natural medicine.\n\nIt has also improved my relationships. If I have a cup of Kratom tea, I am much more open with my family, friends, and those I love. I have had such great conversations in the past year since I started adding Kratom as a dietary supplement that I probably wouldn't have had otherwise. \n\nOne final area that Kratom has bettered my life is in my passion of music. I'm a musician, I love writing songs and performing. It truly brings me joy. Finding the inspiration to sit down and write a song can be such a difficulty for creative people like myself. I'm sure this plant affects everyone differently, but for me, it gets me motivated. It gets me fired up about music. It makes me want to set goals for myself, and lays upon me a desire to become the best musician that I can possibly be. \n\nI would like to thank the DEA for opening up this comment site and hearing out the thousands of people who responsibly use Kratom to better their lives. I really hope that it doesn't become scheduled, however, I would love to see studies done on this plant. Like any supplement, I think it's important to explore the full effects that it has on one's body. \n\nI don't think it is the answer to all the problems that normal people like myself have, but I think there's a great chance (if studies on Kratom commence), it could turn out to be a great natural alternative to the drugs that pharmaceutical companies prescribe that often have more negative than positive effects.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15348","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please reconsider making Kratom illegal.

However, even in my short experience with this material, I can safely say that the effects and results I have had with it can only lead me to believe that the present controversy surrounding it's legality is incredibly overblown. \n   I initially purchased kratom as a safeguard to my recurring kidney stones, not wanting to keep quantities of opiates in the house and also not wanting to shell out several thousand dollars for an ER visit should one strike me in the middle of the night. It has also helped with anxiety at times and my meralgia paresthetica, allowing me to forego taking gabapentin on a regular basis.\n  Having tested a variety of strains of kratom from a handful of peer-reviewed vendors, I can only describe it's effects as incredibly mild, regardless of the amount consumed. The worst I experienced was a bit of nausea, but there was never a corresponding increased \"high\", and in fact any \"high\" that was experienced could only be described as a \"mild feeling of content\". This would not be very attractive as a drug of abuse to thrillseekers. Additionally, I have never felt any type of craving or need to take it. I have tested this by specifically and deliberately refraining from consuming any kratom for a period of time after taking it daily for over a month and had no physical or mental withdrawals.\n   Keeping in mind that nearly all of the evidence presented (both by the DEA/FDA and supporters of kratom) is anecdotal, there is currently no real evidence to support a ban on these ingredients. Poison control calls (whether by consumer or third party) is not controlled enough to provide actual evidence, especially considering verification of actual consumption (with no other contaminants present) is not actually performed. The presence of kratom in a heterogeneous environment where other, proven death-causing drugs are present, is also insufficient evidence. A relatively straightforward example would be adding cyanide to coffee and then blaming coffee for the death. Such an emotional conclusion would be more appropriately found in a campaign speech than in a medical or legal environment.\n  To my knowledge, as there are no human studies, there is also no indication of an addiction profile beyond anecdotal.  To imply one would be to give this anecdotal evidence validity and therefore all anecdotal evidence must also be given validity. Clearly, based upon the number in opposition to this ban, there are far more people that do not experience the adverse effects attributed to kratom as listed in the original Federal Register.\n  All of this being said, I would certainly like to see more testing on this interesting plant. Long-term effects are, of course, unknown at this time, but it would seem to fall into a category much more like caffeine than heroin. Logically it would follow that it also be regulated similarly. Allow individual states to classify and regulate it as their constituents choose and refrain from additional unnecessary intervention and federal regulation unless absolutely necessary.\n  As an aside, I am a 38 year-old computer professional with over eighteen years of industry experience. I have a wife and one daughter. I am a homeowner, attended Johns Hopkins University, and I am a member of North American Mensa (not currently active).  As a responsible adult, I would like to continue to see supplements like kratom made available for those who choose to use it responsibly. With so many other, more important things to be concerned with, it's perplexing to see this type of stance being considered.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Remshaw","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please allow the FDA to conduct research on kratom before trying to schedule it.

A few words about myself first. \nI am a collage graduate in my early 30's. My occupation is a Mechanical Engineer. \nSince early adulthood I have struggled with depression, anxiety, social anxiety, and alcohol abuse. I have a family history of alcoholism and substance abuse. My father had abused prescribed pain medications and xanax and had become addicted to both after a surgery in 2011.  The addictions to the prescription meds brought out the worst in him. I was fearful to seek treatment for my own health issues involving anxiety and depression based on the outcome of my fathers abuse with the prescribed substances. I avoided treatment for these reasons. \nI first discovered kratom 2.5 years ago when searching the internet for an alternative to prescription medications.  I would read the experience with of others who tried and found success for providing some relief in the same problems I was dealing with. I was hopeful that this plant could live up to these claims. \nI first tried Kratom before going out for a social engagement with people I was unfamiliar with, a scenario which has in the past led me to drink excessively to curb the social anxiety. This time I found myself clam not wanting to drink. This was a big help and allowed me to for the first time, limit drinking in social situations.  In the past 2.5 years I have drastically reduced the amount I drink and I can say that I don't over do it anymore when it comes to drinking. Alcohol abuse is not something I worry about anymore. \nNot only has Kratom helped me in social interactions but it provides me anti-depression effects, boosting motivation which allows me to be productive and accomplish more tasks which in turn increases my self confidence. This effect I think has a long term result in reducing anxiety. \nI use Kratom in very low doses from 0.125-0.50g of powdered leaf once to twice a day when needed. I find myself needing to use Kratom 3-10 days a month.  I do not experience any negative effects from Kratom at these doses but are extremely effective for me. I see no problem with this plant. I believe it should be tested further for its beneficial properties. It is a low cost and natural way to improve the lives of many. Please do not place a ban or restrict Kratom. \nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12099","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Westmoreland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am 28 years old and an Army veteran of 10 years with three combat deployments.

I am currently 30 years of age. I was in a motorcycle accident at the age of 18 which resulted in injuries substantial enough to require a decent amount of surgery and a year of heavy therapy and recovery. It was at this time that the doctor that performed my surgery first prescribed me OxyContin. Before this, I was a completely clean person and had never used any drugs, nor did I even smoke or drink alcohol. I was very healthy and worked out every day. I had always struggled with depression and extreme shyness and antisocial tendencies though. I distinctly remember the doctor telling me when I asked what OxyContin was, \"It's what's called an opiate. It's real good for pain, you will like it!\" If only I knew what I was getting myself into...I remember the first one I took still, it wasn't like anything I had ever experienced before, and unlike most people may say, I was hooked from that first one. I remember quickly running out of the prescription the doctor gave me, and at the time I had just happened to have an old friend of mine move back to town that I hadn't seen in years, and he was easily able to get more OxyContin, as well as many other opiates for us from local dealers. Needless to say, I was pretty much a daily user from day one as a result. Years later I remember waking up one day with a heroin needle hanging from my arm and thinking, \"what happened to me?\" By this point, I had been using for so long, my tolerance was through the roof, to where I was using at least 6 times a day and having to use well over a gram of heroin and/or oxy, whichever was easiest to get, per day just to keep from withdrawing, and usually using even more than that in between those times just to try and get high. My daily habit was at this point running me around $120/day. I had sold and pawned most all of my possessions and always found a way to get my fix, but luckily had a moment of clarity that day I asked myself what had happened. I tried kicking cold turkey at this point and for the first time really realized how bad I had messed myself up. I just could not stand the withdrawals no matter what, including the precipitative withdrawals that came after the initial ones, so I kept relapsing and ending up back even worse than before I tried to quit the last time. In desperation, I finally found a local methadone clinic and was very fortunate to find a good counselor there who believed in me. I am convinced to this day that she saved my life, because had I kept going at the rate I was, I am certain now that I would've been dead probably within a month if I hadn't gotten out at that time. I enrolled in the program and slowly but surely got my life back together. I've now been in a methadone program for about 7 years, and am to the point where I would like to get off of methadone, and I had used kratom occasionally in the past before the methadone program for withdrawal symptoms, with somewhat decent results, and decided a few months ago to start making a plan to slowly ween down and off of methadone and to switch to kratom once I got completely off the methadone. I have had enough experience with kratom to know that you can not get high from it at all, nor is it habit forming due to its self-regulating nature as a natural plant. If used properly though, it does however almost completely negate any withdrawal symptoms of opiates, and keeps users from craving other opiates. In this regard, it is an ideal plant for effectively helping severe opiate addicts like myself from using hard opiates, and is very effective as a maintenance herb to keep someone like me from relapsing. I am just one of millions of recovering opiate addicts who could benefit from the use of kratom as an alternative to a life of using opiates that I know would otherwise result in my death. In this regard, I believe keeping kratom legal in the United States will save lives, including my own. If kratom is made illegal, I would have no option for anything to turn to once off of methadone and am certain I would ultimately relapse. I do not want this to happen, and I know now that I am not alone. Please consider my story and keep kratom legal. It is a safe and effective method of saving so many lives for addicts suffering in the U.S., as well as a healthy alternative for people in pain management programs. Contrary to the DEA's belief, it would truly only do harm to people if it was made illegal and they had no other options as a result than to resort to much more harmful drugs. Thank you for taking the time to listen and please objectively consider this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21139","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Devin Hofford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to voice my opinion on Kratom while the govt is listening.\n\nI am a regular Kratom user.\n\nI started using Kratom when I read articles about recovering addicts using it to ease withdraws.  I am a recovering addict, clean for nearly 2 years, and I have to give some thanks to Kratom.  Whether it was a placebo effect or something actually working, I truly believe it did help me kick a very bad habit.\n\nWhile using it I discovered it had uplifting effects much like caffeine.  I have continued to use it on a regular basis as a product that helps me get through a dragging workday, or just when I need a little pick-me-up.  It is in no way intoxicating, in fact the effects are much more mild than caffeine.  This is why I choose to use it.  Caffeine has well known negative effects.  In me personally, at some point it just starts to have a bad effect on mood, energy level, and causes anxiety.\n\nKratom on the other hand, seems to just give a boost in energy and mood, without the harsh effects of caffeine.\n\nIn closing, I would like to reiterate that this herb is in no way intoxicating.  Any reports that it has been, or that it has caused medical emergencies, I believe, must surely have been due to other substances being used with it (fake marijuana, bathsalts, or any other drug.  I also do not believe it to be addictive.  I have never experienced cravings or withdrawal symptoms after using it.  I would hate to see this substance be made unavailable. If for no other reason, its potential to help others overcome other bad habits.\n\nThank You\nJason Cox","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7671","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Cox","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The first time I heard about kratom was from my friend who suffers from Endometriosis.

I was panicking as my final month of insurance was coming up so I hit the internet and found info on Kratom. The withdraws I felt from trying to get off xanax, a prescription a doctor told me was fine to take, was hell for me. Kratom and kratom alone helped me get off xanax. It just about removed all withdraw effects, if not all of them. It also helps me a lot with my pain I feel every day. It effects the body no different then a way a cup of coffee would and in my case, less. These are peoples lives you are taking away.

There is ample evidence to state that Kratom is not harmful. The kratom community has made every attempt to work with and satisfy regulatory agencies on reasonable regulations for this helpful herb. The emergency scheduling authority was granted to the DEA by representatives of the people to handle synthetic cannabanoids, MDMA like chemicals, as well as other psychoactive compounds which are clandestine manufactured abroad and imported to the U.S. without any previous study. History as well as modern scientific process has indicated that kratom is safe for human consumption and using the temporary scheduling authority for a God given plant is not only dangerous, it significantly limits the types of innovation that the U.S. has been known for. I am an Alabama resident, and it is a kratom prohibited state. Since SB227 became law, the trend of drug poisoning related to narcotics in our state has increased, as well as heroin related death. This is a fact that can not be ignored. Almost 200,000 people signed our petition to get congress involved which is more than 5 times the number of people who die annually from narcotics and heroin.

I was born with birth defect that compromised my immune system. This defect has inflicted me with pain throughout my body as long as i can remember. As i grew older i was subject to countless hours of medical testing. I basically grew up in a hospital. I spent days & weeks at a time during my entire childhood in the hospital. It seemed as though everything could potentially kill me. As i entered adulthood my pain increased. Add to this a broken family & abuse & i became depressed. An accumulation of pain & depression, topped off with PTSD & i was destined to end up a pawn in the pharmaceutical industry. These medications did not work. They caused me increasingly more & more complications. So much so, that i failed to remain stable. I spent more than 5 years homeless & could not help myself. When your as bad as i was, nobody else wants to help you either. Fast forward to 28 years of age. I was inflicted with a horrible injury working at a Steele foundry. This injury left me bed ridden for the next two years. From that point on i was labled by the state as disabled. That opened up a flood gate of pharmaceutical medications. This happened around the same time our country was flooded with opiates. I became addicted like millions of others. I spent the next 16 years nonfunctional & a burden upon everyone around me. All my past problems with depression soon caught up to me. Once again i was a product of the pharmaceutical industry, but this time i was so inundated with these drugs that not only could i not function, but was angry & intolerant of the very people around me who were trying to help me. I couldn't trust anyone. When I came to terms with the fact that i could not trust the very people our society put most of their trust into,..the medical community. I gave up, accepted that i was a burden, & concieded to the belief that my life was over. After coming out of my drug induced haze & realizing that if this was going to change, then i half to be the one to change it, & i was on my own. So after countless hours of research, & leaving myself in financial straits , & trying countless other remedies, i finally found what i sought after my whole life. Believe me when i say, that i was a harsh sceptic. I had doubts & arguments that would make the DEA themselves, think I'm too critical. However, since i really had no other options at this point, i gave this little plant a chance. So many were raving about it, that i had to check it out. At this point i will testify under oath that this natural, unaltered plant has given me my quality of life back. My pain is gone. I have zero side effects, & am capable & functional on a level that is twice the ability i had prior to consuming this plant. I still live with my permanent injuries, but now they dont dominant my existence. If this weren't enough, one of the bennifits of consuming this plant, besides all the previously mentiond attributes, is how this seems to have change my state of mind. I am for the first time ever starting to trust again, & since the pain isn't dominating my every thought, i am way more easy going & am watching my life being returned to me in every conceivable way. I can start to smile again after 40 years. I can socialize.  There is not one substance on this planet that i know of, that has the positive impact that ive experienced & witnessed in others around me, who also have discovered this plant, kratom. I cannot recall even one negative side effect whatsoever. After all of the side effects from pharmaceutical drugs that ive experienced, i wish to make perfectly clear that if kratom made me \"high\" or clouded my mind, or negatively effected me In any way whatsoever, i would not take it. If i wanted something that did that to me , it would be a lot cheaper for me to take the pharmaceutical drugs, since their paid for.      Sincerely.....

The pharmaceuticals that I was prescribed before were harsh on my system and I could hardly go out 30 minutes before I'd be in significant pain. \n\nUtilizing small doses of Kratom, 1-2 grams twice a day, I am able to go out for hours at a time. I am not currently taking any pharmaceutical products and have been doing better than ever thanks to this wonderful supplement! \n\nJust recently my family came to visit me in Colorado and I was able to go on 4-6 hour hikes with them at elevations of up to12,000 ft. This would have been impossible for me without Kratom!  My family was overjoyed to see me doing so well. The trip from my house into the mountains had never been so easy. It's nice being able to relax instead of worrying were the next bathroom is all the time.\n\nPlease don't remove Kratom. If you do my quality of life will drastically decrease. It will mean much less time that I can spend away from home and less wonderful memories out and about with my loved ones. \n\nSincerely,\n\nBrian Joseph Lueb","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7800","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Lueb","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I became aware of Kratom via social media and am interested in its use to help with opioide addiction.

I am a responsible, single mom who has been a dental hygienist for 19 years.  I was diagnosed 15 years ago with an auto immune disease called Ulcerative Colitis.  I go through periods where it is active and in remission, but when it flares up, I have a very hard time working and participating in everyday duties due to the pain it causes.  I do not have the luxury of taking anti inflammatories for pain due to it worsening a flare up and do not like the way I feel taking narcotic pain medication which would also prevent me from doing my job.  I discovered Kratom which reduces my pain enough during these flare ups without all the negative effects that I've experienced from narcotic medications.  I'm fortunate that I only take it during these flare ups which are not constant and I have no negative effects when I do not take it.  I'm asking that there be more research on this plant which has helped me tremendously and given me times of relief where I can live my life somewhat normally.  I know there are many people out there that relying on this plant to give them relief and am scared so many of those people, including myself, will have to turn to narcotics and possibly cause a health crisis regarding narcotics that we've never seen before.  I'm not as reliant on this plant for pain since i'm not in constant pain, but my quality of life would diminish tremendously when my ulcerative colitis is active if this is scheduled.  I realize your job is to protect us from harmful substances, but from my own personal experience, this plant is not harmful and has helped many people. I appreciate that we can have this chance to tell our experiences.  Please consider my comment as you make final considerations.  Thank you.

I am writing today to urge you to reconsider the scheduling of Kratom.  This is my familys story.  My husband, Bill has suffered from migraines since the age of six.  They have progressed to his most recent diagnosis of chronic daily migraines.  He has migraine symptoms every day.  Some days are worse than others.  He has Vagel migraines which means they affect his Vagus nerve, causing issues with gait, blood pressure, and cognition.  On the worst days, they severely limit his ability to function.\nAbout five years ago we heard about Kratom.  We found that Kratom helped him function on even the really bad days.  He was able to participate in family functions, return to work on a full-time basis, and re-engage on a social level that was not possible before.\nThen four years ago, on August 20, 2012, we lost my stepson, my husbands only child to suicide.  My stepson, Billy was 26.  He died from a single shotgun wound to the head at point blank range.  My husband found him.  Since that time he has been diagnosed with severe PTSD and anxiety.  And that is on top of a soul-crushing grief he carries with him every day.\nKratom again has been his saving grace.  It helps him get out of bed and go through the motions of the day.  It helps him through night terrors, anxiety attacks and so many other dark moments in his day.  It is a large part of how he goes on.\nFour years ago, I lost my stepson.  If you schedule Kratom, I fear I will lose my husband too.  I beg you to reconsider. \n\nSincerely,\nLinda J Tice","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8656","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Linda Tice","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am from Wyoming, but I am currently a Sophomore at a college in Boston. I have struggled with alcohol consumption for a couple years, but recently it became so severe as a result of depression, anxiety, and various factors that I was drinking 9+ bottles of beer per night, or over a bottle of wine per night. I started having difficulty performing in classes and my health plummeted. I stopped eating well and started shedding hair like crazy. It tried stopping several times, but always relapsed with another night of binge drinking.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Because my alcohol consumption became so severe, and my inability to stop drinking led me to find Kratom. I was searching for something that could take the edge off of my depression and anxiety, (and something that was legal). Anyway, Kratom had a profound affect on me. When I first took it, I felt much more at ease and happy, almost a sensation of content. Instead of drinking to oblivion, I find that I can cope with my feelings MUCH better with Kratom. I haven't had any alcohol to drink for a month now, I have been eating better, and made tremendous improvements with my emotional and physical health. Kratom has changed my life for the better in so many ways, and allowed me to stop drinking alcohol. I cannot FATHOM how Kratom could be used in an illegal way, or how this plant could deemed a \"public threat\"?? From what I have experienced thus far, it has only been a tremendously positive and helpful supplement!

I agree that it should be studied more, but it has been used for hundreds, if not thousands of years safetly in Thailand and in the United States for at least a couple decades so I do not think it should be deemed a dangerous substance and banned outright. Now if there was undeniable proof of it being dangerous and harmful then I would understand.                                                                                                                                   As for me, I've been taking kratom off and on over the past four years and have never had any problems from it. I feel like it helps keep my energy levels up during the day like coffee would, and this is important because I work construction. Also important is the fact that it does not cause a high, I retain clarity of mind and no feelings of intoxication. I feel this plant also helps ease the sore muscles after a long day of work and makes sleep much easier. Now I'm not saying kratom cures anything, but I do feel like it has a lot of potential and I've benefited from it immensely. So I'm going to ask again, please don't take away the freedom for people to choose a safe plant that they may benefit from. Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14281","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Spencer ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a 31 year old female. I am a tax paying law abiding citizen who uses Kratom everyday. I do not use Kratom to treat my ailments but I do use it because it's helps me feel better. I was once addicted to opiates and Kratom helped me feel better when I came off of them. Kratom helps with my pain, helps lift my mood, and helps me become a more productive and hard working individual. Kratom has never made me feel inebriated. Mother Nature gives us many gifts and I believe Kratom is a lovely gift with so much potential to not treat ailments but help others feel more comfortable in their bodies. I believe that should be our birth given right. I pray for all beings to be happy and comfortable. Kratom has changed my life in the most beautiful and profound way. I pray that myself and all others whom take it to be comfortable in their bodies will be able to continue to do so. Thank you so much to take the time out of your busy schedules to read my story.

I'm in less pain, my head is clear, and I don't have to keep taking larger amounts of kratom to get the same results. The people around me noticed right away how much better I was doing.

At the age of 16 I was in a terrible car accident that shattered my right hip. A team of surgeons managed to pin and screw my hip back together, this lasted about a year before the bone that was reconstructed died and decayed due to blood lines not regrowing to my hip. I had a hip replacement at the age of 17. Arthritis set in on my hip making it VERY painful most every day. I was prescribed large amounts of percocet and Vicodin to combat the pain, then I became addicted. I went back after my 21st birthday to have a check up with my surgeon when he told me that they would no longer be prescribing me painkillers, and told me to take Aleve instead. Aleve did not help one bit so I took to the streets to find pills, this lasted for about a year and a half, when I could no longer find Percocet and Vicodin on the streets I found another substitute called Oxycontin, this is where things went downhill fast. I gained a huge tolerance to Oxycontin. I was taking nearly 500 mgs of Oxycontin per day. I spent every dollar I had to get Oxycontin, I took out title loans on my vehicles and sold most all of my assets. I couldn't live this way any longer so I  took out another title loan on my SUV to get on suboxone, which made my hip pain unbearable, so I went back to oxycontin again, this time it took everything I had. Disgusted with my life I researched online for help and came across an article on Kratom, I placed an order online for a small amount and received it next day air. Since that day I have no longer had pain, or any urge to use opiates. Kratom has changed my life. I now hold a steady 40+ hour a week job, have a brand new car, and I am looking for a house for my fiance and 4 month old son in the spring. None of this would have been possible without Kratom. I am now the person I could only have dreamt of becoming in years past.

At this time I currently use Mitragyna Speciosa (Kratom) for pain in my jaw.  I tore the cartlidge in my jaw when I was a police officer and have had six surgieries since.  Instead of being addicted to pain medication kratom has allowed me to function at a high level.  I drive, teach, coach, and administer a strong academic/athletic program.  To move the alkaloids in this natural herb to the schedule I list would have a negative effect on the incease of perscription opiods and heroin use.  More people die each year on energy drinks than kratom.  Lets look at the academic evidence and scientific research before making an irrational decision driven by big pharmeceutical companies.  Let this be the time that money does not drive the decision the DEA makes.

Trimbath. I am a 35 year old woman. I  am a waitress, having just  recently reentered the workforce  after approximately 7-8 years receiving disability benefits after a sexual assault left me with extreme symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I  oppose DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, of the Kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances for personal as well as larger reasons.\n\nI began drinking kratom tea a year ago. I have taken many psychotropic medications to no effect. The PTSD symptomd were extremely painful and disabling. I was unable to work  and led a very desperate and painful life - most of the time in my bed. I have not only sought and and worked with a therapist for years, but also, through the support of my friends and family, financed a little known treatment for PTSD with Dr. Eugene Lipov in Chicago called Stellate Ganglion Block for PTSD. This treatment has been featured on many news broadcasts. It helped a great deal but was not enough to defeat some of the worst symptoms. In short, I have worked very hard at the task of taking care of my health and received little relief. I tried kratom as a last resort; not believing an herbal tea could provide relief.  Kratom has been remarkably efficacious in relieving my disability and pain. I cannot sleep or stay in bed any longer and for the first time in many years I am looking forward to the future, to working and contributing to my economy, rebuilding my relationships with my family and God. I am also falling in love. These are no small things. Those closest to me have been astounded by the positive changes in my mood, energy, and spirit thanks to Kratom and the emotional work it helps me do because I am no longer in a state of constant distress and desperation.\n\nThe DEA scheduling of Kratom would make it illegal for me to take the only thing I have that works. I would once again be dependent on state benefits. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose. Thank you for your time.\n\nSincerely, \nNina Marie Trimbath","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5614","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nina Trimbath","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My 58 year old wife has been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and has suffered for ten years with pain, depression and anxiety.

After my youngest was born I was diagnosed with postpartum depression and put on SSRIs. After 9 months of being on the meds, I still didn't feel like myself, so on the advice of my physician I stopped taking them. A couple months later I had my 4 wisdom teeth removed and was put on narcotic pain medicine. It didn't take long for me to become addicted. Unlike so many people who become addicted after surgery I am lucky that I have a husband and parents who intervened quickly. I began therapy and rehab and although I was clean and staying off all drugs, my postpartum depression made life miserable. I didn't want to go back on SSRIs and I definitely didn't want to go back to narcotic pain meds to numb the depression, so I began doing research into natural supplements to help my mood and curb my opiate cravings (the worse my depression the more I crave opiates). That's when I discovered Kratom. I've been taking Kratom as needed for depression for 2 years. My mood has improved thus completely eliminating my opiate cravings. I sometimes take kratom everyday but I'll sometimes go up to 2 weeks without any. I take it on average 4 times a week. I don't know where I would be without it. I hope so much that kratom will continue to be available to me and others who may be hooked on pain pills or heroin and haven't discovered it yet.

A lot of this is due to my age.  \nIf kratom becomes illegal,  I do not think that  there is a replacement on the pharmaceutical market.  I know that there are millions like me who do not abuse drugs and rely on kratom to lead a normal life-Please keep it legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18078","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"mike jehl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My husband had 4 herniated disks due to an injury at work.  For over a year he went through therapy, shot treatment, shock treatment, more therapy.  Nothing helped.  He ended up having surgery to correct the issue.  The surgery did not work and he ended up with nerve damage.  He is unable to walk more than 10 minutes without having to sit down from the pain.  He was not eligible for Disability because of his age, it was denied.  He had no choice but to work full time with a condition that will last the rest of his life.  So he could continue to work and support his family, he has been prescribed Oxycontin & Oxycodone for the pain. While these medications have helped, he can now stand on his feet longer to complete his job, the side effects of these medications make him tired, along with being treated as a drug addict by pharmacists and pharmacists assistance along with the public's lack of knowledge on chronic pain sufferers.  After doing lengthy research, I found out about Kratom.  Kratom has assisted my husband with his injury and chronic pain.  He has no side effects from using this legal substance and it costs a lot less than our copays each month, helping our insurance premium stay manageable.  Scheduling Kratom will be hurting people such as my husband who has chronic pain and is forced to work with a viable disability.  this product has provided more help to those who wish to no longer take prescription medication with nasty side effects, those who wish to get off of drugs without the nasty side effects and has helped people remain feeling like a human being instead of a drug addict as society and pharmacists treat those in pain.  Please do your research.  It is not possible to overdose on this medication, you will only throw-up.

It was also discovered that my back was riddled with degenerative disc disease, or DDD. I also found I am suffering from osteoarthritis. I also was diagnosed with fibromyalgia along with chronic depression and anxiety. My doctor placed me on vicodin for the pain, Zoloft and xanax for depression and anxiety.

Meanwhile, because of side affects from the drugs, my job became nearly impossible to do. It was then that I became determined to find a NATURAL supplement that would help!  Thats when I found kratom! Believe me when I tell you, my pain disappeared! And NO side affects. My anxiety and depression are being helped BETTER than the zoloft and Xanax!

I broke my neck in an accident when I was 18yrs old (20yrs ago).  Luckily, I can still walk and have the use of my body.  2 other people who went into the hospital that week with the same injury can not.  But, I do have arthritis and pain in my neck everyday.  I was prescribed opioids and tramadol for years and basically became a junky on legal \"heroin\".  My life was a mess, I couldn't have sex or urinate normally anymore and the would go into withdrawals anytime I went without my \"medicine\".  Then while reading about ways to get off of the opioids, I found out about Kratom.  The first day I tried it I was amazed at how well this powder worked for my pain, but also that it could stop the withdrawals from the opioids that my doctor had prescribed me for 15yrs.  I stopped taking vicodin, cold turkey, and have never looked back.  I'm no longer tied to going to my doctor's clinic every 30 days to get refills and I no longer feel like a junkie.  All of the side effects I was experiencing slowly went away and I feel like a normal person again.  I can't go back to feeling that way or living that way.  If kratom is banned, I will have no choice but to find Kratom on the black market somehow.  Becoming a criminal will be a better option than going back to the life I lived on opioids.  I have a great job, a great family, I've never been arrested or even had a speeding ticket.  I have two young daughters who I want to be able to enjoy without being in constant pain and I want them to be able to enjoy having me as their father.  With kratom in my life, I can do that.  Without it, I cannot.  Don't turn me into a criminal.  No one is in danger from kratom other than the drug pushing doctors and pharmaceutical companies.  Please, just let me live this normal life I've found with kratom.

Submission to slavery means surrender of life.\n\nThe fact that Mankind cannot enter into his/her natural inheritance means that part of it has been taken from him or her, either by means of force (old, legalized conquest or robbery) or fraud (persuasion that the State or its servants or an inherited property-owning class is entitled to privilege). All present systems of ownership mean that some are deprived of the fruits of their labor. It is true that, in a competitive society, only the possession of independent means enables one to be free of the economy (that is what Proudhon meant when, addressing himself to the self-employed artisan, he said \"property is liberty\", which seems at first sight a contradiction with his dictum that it was theft). But the principle of ownership, in that which concerns the community, is at the bottom of inequity.\n\nIf we accept the principle of a socialized society, and abolish hereditary privilege and dominant classes, the State becomes unnecessary.

Its effects are not much more then a strong cup of coffee, and it is much more safe as well. It does not make your heart race, and give you a crash. It is a God send for me. I have used it moderately for the past 4 years with no adverse side effects. The only thing I noted one time was a slight upset stomach, I had taken it on an empty stomach in the morning and i usually don't handle food or anything very well until afternoon. Now heres the thing, I only have ever taken 1 gram at a time, no more than three times a day and i am fine. I have read of people taking in upwards of 10 or even 15 grams at ones, witch to me is way to much. But even then those people are still alive and fine, and the worst thing that happened to them was they vomited. Hmmm, this sounds very very familiar.... Alcohol, it comes down to the same situation. I like a drink every now and then and so do millions of other Americans, but then we have people who drink, and drink, and drink, until they are a full blown alcoholic. Now this is like comparing apples and oranges so lets not get this confused. Alcohol in heavy amounts will KILL you, (I have seen family and friends taken from this terrible drug we call \"Alcohol\") Kratom in heavy amounts on the other hand will only    make you vomit, and thats it. People have used Kratom for hundreds of years and not one person has been killd from it. Oh the naysayers and the news have all kinds of reports saying \"Died from Kratom Overdose\" when in reality the autopsy reports ALWAYS show another drug in there system. No one. No one has been hurt from Kratom alone. I will conclude this with the fact that the NCBI, and US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health have done a government funded study on Kratoms use for Opioid withdrawal, and found it to work with success. Schedule 1 control would end all further scientific study! Personally i would like to see Kratom regulated like Alcohol, you would need a license to sell it and have to be 21 years of age to purchase it. There is only so much you can do to educate people on the effects of abusing substances, after that its up to the individual to make the right choice and consume it responsibly.

This was not always the case. In highschool I had my wisdom teeth removed & was given the opiate vicoprofen. unfortunately right after this while working at a dog shelter I was bitten by dogs while trying to break up a dog fight and left with badly mauled hands. Again I was sent home with hydrocodone. Little did I know these Doctors, the ones I trusted with my health now had me hooked on pharmaceuticals! Eventually by 2006-2007 I realised I was dependent on the hydrocodone and went to the doctor immediately after trying to naively stop and Dr. Terry Rustin put me on SUBOXONE which is a VERY EXPENSIVE synthetic opiate to treat opiate dependence! This suboxone at the time I believed was a god send! Over the next few following years I stayed on suboxone to repair my opiate receptors until about 2012. When I stopped there was a delayed withdrawal that they don't tell you about. Yet again I was stuck. I tapered down from 10mg suboxone to 0.25mg but  Withdrawal from even 0.25 mg of suboxone isn't fun it lasts 18 days! Now, to  put that in perspective, withdrawal from hydrocodone while more intense lasts 3-5 days. Even after all of that I did not feel NORMAL!  Soon I found the real miracle I was looking for not from a drug, but a legal plant related to coffee a supplement called ....KRATOM!\n\nI heard about kratom in passing as a miracle very mild plant but it was performing tasks like helping people stop heroin, adderall, alcohol and most of all taking away cravings.  Kratom made me feel normal I got up off my butt and went back to school and finished in 2013 and got my LMT license. As a supplement I have noticed changes in my mood its lightly uplifted calming but with the energy of coffee which makes sense seeing it is related to coffee. The other non medical but supplement changes I have seen is with my social anxiety as well as reduced need for anxiety related meds to stop anxiety attacks, I do not get diarrhea as before my stomach was very sensitive due to IBS. The other supplement actions I have noticed after a hard day of massage is the reduced pain after consuming 2-4 grams of powdered kratom in a tea. I overall took kratom for 2-1/2 years this was cheep and worked like a charm, soon I was off suboxone and even off kratom. I have had blood tests conducted by quest labs and Dr. Jeffries  and none of them indicated elevated liver enzyme levels or any issues after prolonged use of kratom. After 2-1/2 years I was able to stop kratom & do not take it to this day. I do not believe it to be addictive or a dangerous supplement/plant material. I have never experienced hallucinations or respiratory depression nor sleep disturbances. I have however noticed increased sexual libido possibly due to the fact some of the \"alkaloids\" (notice how I didnt use the word \"opiate\" because it does not come from the poppy plant ;) are relate to yohimbine another supplement.\n \nI would also Like to note that I come from a long line of doctors & healthcare professionals and you are welcome to google them basically the whole side of my dads family starting with my grandfather and this will continue down the line to my younger brother Buck Boren who is about to be accepted in to Texas Tech medical school and has already interviewed. Grandfather: urological surgeon - DR. James Boren, Father- chiropractor Dr. John Boren, Uncle- Dr. Chuck Boren, Older brother and oncology surgeon Dr. Todd Boren. I am telling you these things not because I am under care of these people but so you know I come from a GREAT family! The reason I am taking the time to write you is because there are thousands if not millions of people in pain and we have an opiate epidemic. peoples lives are at risk by the decisions you make. \n\nIf kratom is banned you are essentially letting people die & driving people back into the hands of drug dealers the cycle of addiction. As a supplement I believe maybe regulated to the sale of people 18 & above it improves the quality of life for many. Failed drug policy shows vacuums created and unknown consequences and a possible increased black market if regulations and scheduling actions are taken. I believe there is not enough data relating to kratom deaths as most if not all also were in combination with other drugs. If my research is correct there were more calls to emergency hotlines for caffeine then kratom. I believe it is in the public's best interest to focus on harmful drugs and opiates then focus on a witch hunt as the dea can clearly barley handle the problems at hand. Alcohol has zero medical value yet is not schedule one and we saw how well prohibition worked. Oxycontin has killed 15k people and is legally sold in pharmacies. Anything that cuts back on opiate use is a GOOD thing! Jailing people for victimless crimes is bad. We all know the real reason -Big Pharma's Patents on Kratom Alkaloid$.

I first started using kratom several years ago in an effort to limit and ultimately get off prescribed pain killers. People that know that i use kratom ask what's it do and I can only answer for me and my experiences.  Kratom is like a cup of coffee that relieve minor aches and pains and provides an energy that is not even that obvious untill you realize that  it has allowed  me to get through  some of my tougher days considering that I have degenerative conditions in my spine. With an opioid epademic going on people need some thing that can help them with their pain physical and their pain in addiction. I'm slightly aware that there have been deaths that were thought to be related to kratom but as far as I know there is really no corroboratING evidenve . Kratom just doesn't cause any type of respitory depression any where if at all like classic opioids. If this tree that has thousands of years of use goes scedules 1 its going to hurt more people than possibly help. How many people will have to go back to using strong opioid pain meds putting them self at risk and possibly sending them back down a rabbit hole that they worked so hard to get out of witH the use of kratom.\nPlease take what I've written and consider the negative impact that sceduling the chemicals in this plant will cause good honest citizens.

But I feel the subject of keeping Kratom legal is extremely important.  I feel that the driving force behind the effort to classify Kratom as a Schedule I drug is misguided and ill informed. Kratom is not the dangerous street drug that some are trying to claim. In fact, it's just the opposite. It's the only legal alternative and in many cases, the only way out for many people who find themselves trapped in the grip of opiate addiction. I am. 43 year old man who found himself addicted to opiates after ten plus years of back problems and surgeries. For years, my doctors readily prescribed opiates to which I, like so many became addicted. When the rules were changed a few years back and the belt was tightened on prescriptions and doctors cut people off on their scripts, when drugs like Lortab were discontinued, the result was the creation of many heroin addicts and criminals.  People who could no longer get the medicines their doctors had pushed on them for years and were left high and dry. In desperation. Opiate withdrawal is a horrific and incapacitating process.  The natural reaction is to do anything necessary to stay well and not have to go through withdrawal.  Many turned to heroin or were forced to buy pills illegally. I was one of the latter. I had a good job and a family to support. I couldn't afford to go to rehab or lose my job because I was going through weeks of withdrawal.  Ultimately, I was arrested for possession of street pills. now with a criminal record haunting me, holding me back in life, I am determined to never be looked at as a criminal again because of what is actually a medical condition. Kratom has made it possible, alomg with counseling and NA meetings, has made that possible. Kratom is the only legal substance that anyone can obtain and use to ween themselves off of opiates. So many of us cannot afford to put life on hold and go to detox and rehab. Kratom makes it possible to work and be productive while healing from addiction. Kratom is a Godsend, not a danger. \nI still have back problems and severe pain intermittently. Kratom is the only natural, non threatening substance that I can use to treat that pain. Thousands of people use this plant safely and responsibly every day. It literally saves lives. Please don't take that lifeline away from those who cannot or choose not to use proven dangerous and addictive pharmaceuticals to treat their ailments. The pharmaceutical companies have enough victims as it is. Don't force us to be slaves to those companies and the addictions they create.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11754","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brad Pointer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Laura Alexander. I am 35 years old.  I'm a stay at home mother. I am active in my community as a volunteer for The Center Against Rape and Domestic Violence. I am active in my church. I work part time from home helping to care for two of my friends autistic children.\n\nI am against Kratom being made a scheduled substance because it would profoundly and negatively affect all aspects of my life.\n\nI was introduced to kratom 4 years ago by a friend who was desperately trying to end his cycles of alcoholism and using prescription opiates to relieve his symptoms of PTSD and chronic pain. He is a Marine who served honorably in Somalia. He was able to find relief through a plant called kratom. \n\nHe introduced me to it because I too sufferer from problems with alcohol, chronic pain and PTSD. I suffered physical injuries and emotional distress because of domestic violence. I was on a cocktail of 8 medications from anti-psychotics and anti depressants to opiate pain pills,  anti anxiety medications and sleeping pills. I never felt more out of control and suicidal than when I was taking all of those medicines. I tried numerous times to commit suicide. I spent months of my life in inpatient treatment. I was approved for a closed case of 4 years of social security disability. When I lost my insurance my doctors basically told me good luck and go away. I couldn't find care and so I returned to heavy drinking. \n\nFrom the first time I tried kratom I felt relief. I no longer felt the need to drink alcohol to numb my emotional distress and pain. My anxiety and irrational fears from ptsd were lessened. I never felt \"high\" only relief. Since then I have finally been able to build up my life. I have made friends where before I had few. I've been able to function like a normal healthy adult. I have had zero side effects other than mild occasional nausea if I haven't eaten enough before I take my dose. During the 4 years I've used this supplement there have been weeks and even months I didn't take it including during a pregnancy and my symptoms always worsened. I never felt addicted though or like I couldn't quit. I just don't see the logic in quitting the one supplement that had helped me so much. I am truly afraid of this supplement becoming unavailable to me because I know that without it I will be right back to the alcohol and the disabling depression.\n\nI implore the DEA to take this matter seriously in that it poses a health risk to many to ban this plant. It is a far greater risk to public health to ban this miracle supplement than any antetodal claims that kratom has caused illness or death. Its been safely used for 100's of years and by more people than we probably even know.\n\nSincerely,\nLaura Alexander","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Alexander","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a single female, age 48.  I have been taking Kratom for over 8 years , initially to help with occasional bouts of depression.  I used to manage a payroll service and then a software development company and did telephone technical support.  In 2010 I had sudden deafness in one ear and have a hearing aid (profound loss) in the other.  A few years back I was told by my ear Doctor to \"get my affairs in order\" and to prepare as I do not have much time left before I am deaf.\n\nBeing a single female homeowner from age 26, I had always been able to support myself, however, not being able to use the telephone or communicate effectively in an office environment has been devastating for me.  I lost my home, all of my life savings is gone and am back to working minimum wage after having earned just over $50k per year for many years.  I fell into a deep depression after losing my home and have tremendous social anxiety.  My depression was so bad that I would stay in the house for weeks at a time and spent most of my days sleeping.  When I lost my health insurance due to job loss and a loophole in the Affordable Care act, I could not afford antidepressants.  I felt they were not helping me anyways and 2 of them made me sleep even more.  That was when things got better.  I couldn't afford my prescription medicine and turned to kratom, which I could afford at just .80 cents per day and it literally saved my life and improved my overall well being very much.\n\nI was told by a social security judge that I am 2 years too young and 10% too much hearing to qualify for disability after working full time for my entire adult (age 15+) life, and was denied because they concluded I am still able to work cleaning offices at night or cleaning circuitry in a factory.  Apparently dignity is not relevant to them.  That was devastating also and right now I am having to work 75 hours per week just to be able to afford an apartment, although I doubt I can keep this up and I'm positive that without Kratom I will not be able to work those kinds of hours.  Kratom helps me to stay awake for long overnight shifts.  I fear that without it, I may end up homeless.\n\nKratom has also kept me from becoming addicted to opiates last year when I started a new job unloading flower and plant deliveries and suffered 2 herniated discs.  I was on pain medicine for 3 months and then realized I could cope fine with just using Kratom daily (before this I had only used it just several times per week).\n\nPlease do not take away my access to Kratom.  I believe it is what gives me, and countless other people,  HOPE to continue on through depression, anxiety and pain.  I have never felt like I have been addicted to Kratom and been off and on since 2008 using it.  Sometimes up to 6 months without using.  Currently I use more frequently but do not feel any sort of withdrawal when I do not use it.  I am so afraid I if I lose Kratom I will have to go back on prescription medication and I prefer natural supplements because it is suspected that I lost my hearing because of prescription drugs.  I realize that permanent hearing is probably a rare side effect, but I believe we should have the right to chose between natural supplements or synthetic drugs.\n\nThank you for reading,\nSincerely, Kathleen Perry","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5467","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kathleen Perry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm Andrew Connally, a 23 year old Dietitian in Pensacola.\n\nKratom is completely safe to consume and putting it on schedule 1 ignores all scientific data we know about it.

I am a 54 year old successful business woman (small business with a full time employee).  wife and mother of 2 teenage kids.  I have been taking Kratom for 5 years, and it has been instrumental in keeping me going through a crippling depression.  \n\nAfter being sidelined with depression and anxiety around 5 years ago,  My doctor began prescribing me a series of antidepressants.  I could not tolerate the way these drugs made me feel.  it turned me into a zombie, and i could not do my job properly.  I began researching online, looking for a natural alternative to help me through this difficult time... I needed to keep going with my work for the sake of my family.  \n\nI began taking moderate doses of Kratom daily and it has transformed me from a sad and non-productive person to a high functioning member of society.  This herb has helped me and so many people.  Through online forums I have heard hundreds of stories of Kratom helping people much worse off than me get their lives back together.  There are a huge amount of people that have used this to get off of opioids, including heroin. It has amazing benefits for people sidelined by painful conditions, too.  \n\nScheduling this herb is completely counterproductive to the war in drugs.  If you truly want to help people, you will let this plant remain legal. The only reason I can see that anyone would want this plant banned is because the pharmaceutical industry is pushing  the ban for its own agenda.  There is absolutely no downside to  letting people detox off of Heroin and pharmaceutical drugs with this herb.  There is no way to OD on Kratom, these people must have also taken other drugs.  Please keep it legal, and let real research be done.  I am convinced that Kratom cam help so may people and in its natural form, is way better than anything that can be produced from it by a drug company.  \n\n I would be happy to talk with you or anyone about my 5 years using this herb and how much it has helped me.  I am extremely healthy, get checked every year and have had no problems at all.. no blood pressure issues, no cholesterol no diabetes, no liver issues.    I believe this herb is about as harmful as a cup of coffee, but its benefits are huge.  \n\nThanks, \n\nDiane Pollock","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8239","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diane Pollock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Greetings!  I'm writing this with the hope that further study on the efficacy and safety of kratom be continued, that sales of the botanical can be continued while it is studied, and most importantly that the ingredients in kratom (specifically the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant), schedule 1 are NOT added to the list of DEA Schedule 1 drugs (or any other DEA scheduling).\n\nAbout Me:  My name is Michael Boetje.  Im a 56 year-old American Citizen who lives in Lawrenceville Georgia.  I have been in the Information Technology profession for the past 32 years and with my current employer for the past 26 years.  I hold a bachelors degree in computer science from the University of West Florida, a masters degree in business administration (MBA) from Georgia State University, and am currently studying for my second masters  this one in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology (aka  Georgia Tech).\n\nHere's my story in as succinct manner as possible.  I was born with a cerebral arterial malformation.  Basically in English, that means a vein in my brain was malformed at birth.  This has been confirmed by both a CT scan at Gwinnett Medical Center and a full cerebral arteriogram performed at Northside Hospital Atlanta around the 1997 time period.\n\nAfter trying various prescriptions for migraines, my doctor and I stumbled across a drug called Maxalt MLT around the 2003 time period.  This worked wonders and stopped my migraines.  Unfortunately in 2006, I had a Myocardial infarction(MI).  Again, in English, a HEART ATTACK at age 44.  I had one artery 100% blocked, a second 80% blocked, and all other arteries were clear.  Since then, I've taken great care of myself, I exercise regularly, lost 60 pounds, and I'm in great shape for a 54 year-old!  However, the debilitating migraines continued.  \n\nMaxalt and all of the newer migraine medications are not indicated for treatment of migraines for those who have experienced an MI. They raise blood pressure and I'm already on BP medications to control my blood pressure and my doctor would not prescribe them anymore.\n\nSo, the only available prescription course of action for me is Hydrocodone and if that doesn't work, I have to go to an urgent care outlet of an emergency room where I'm usually given a shot of Demerol or Morphine.\n\nI became (and am) tired of taking these horrible and addictive medications and having to go into the doctor for urinalysis every 90 days and monthly appointments.  I only learned about kratom a year ago unfortunately.  But since I began taking kratom in small dosages daily I've managed to have far fewer migraine instances (I take about 1 gram in the morning each day).  If I start to feel a migraine coming on, I immediately take 3 grams in capsule form and then 1 gram every hour up to a maximum of 6 grams per day.\n\nWhile kratom has not completely eliminated Hydrocodone from my migraine regimen, it's now only used as a last resort.  With kratom, I've been able to CUT MY USAGE OF HYDROCODONE BY 75% (not yelling - caps used for emphasis only).  Furthermore, I AM NOT addicted to kratom, if I stop taking it, usually nothing happens but on occasion, I will have a migraine which is far worse than the migraine I would have had if I had only taken my 1 gram of kratom that morning.\n\nI've spoken with my doctor about my Kratom usage and he's fine with it - he said he preferred me taking it instead of the Hydrocodone if it worked and isn't worried about the alleged side effects.\n\nIn summary, I'm in a lot better shape than some people.  If kratom is banned, I still have the option of having my doctor increase the amount of hydrocodone pills prescribed monthly.  Some people do not have that option.  For some people, there is no drug that can ease their pain - they only have kratom.  I can't help but think that my government would not deny a necessary botanical which carries such benefits.\n\nMy plea is for you to listen to my story, and the stories of many kratom users and not treat kratom in the same category as heroin, LSD, or bath salts.  The time for more research is at hand, if you're reading this, the decision may lie in your hands.

She is a law abiding citizen and uses it for her pain.  She has a condition called Endometriosis which causes severe stabbing pains in her pelvic region.  Many women suffer from this condition daily and usually have to turn to a narcotic pain reliever to get by.  Most of the time this pill will help but there are times when it barely touches the pain.  My sister is a rare case where her body doesn't metabolises her Norco fast enough that it doesn't help with her pelvic pain like it does a tooth ache or other painful things.  Once this was discovered through a series of blood test we started to research what other options she could look into that would help with the pain.  That's when we found Kratom.  She tried it and it worked wonderfully.  She is now back to living a daily life without the pain that would keep her bed for days and in tears.  She takes Kratom as directed and doesn't abuse it.  This is a wonderful natural suppliment that controls her pain and now she doesn't need a narcotic that barely touched her pain.  She can raise her daughter and not he doped up.  So please consider this as you decide how to label this supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8255","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Diana Guerra","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please don't make Kratom a schedule 1 drug","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20998","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Larry Sallee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a future health care professional, I believe it is a disservice to make a plant that could benefit thousands of people schedule 1.

With the opioid epidemic, we need every possible resource to combat this problem. If kratom would to become schedule 1, this would hurt many people relying on it today. As we have seen from marijuana, it is nearly impossible to remove a drug from the schedule 1 listing. As of now, there seems to be no major negative side effects from kratom in people using it. However, we do not know enough about the drug to understand all of its effects. This is why making it schedule 1 is counter intuitive to helping people. We need to study it now to be able to help the mass of the public in the future, and the people taking it right now do not seem to be suffering from any major side effects.

I am writing this to you at the end of a busy day as a middle class, college educated working mom who has allergies to most over the counter and prescription pain relievers. Allow me to illustrate with actual examples from my own life without kratom:\n\nMama! Push me on the rope swing!\nIm sorry sweetie, mama is hurting too much today. Can we sit and read together instead?\nNo, mama I want you to push me!! I dont want to read right now!!\n\nHey mom, I have an idea, can we get supplies to make a pie to take to Grannys?\nOh honey, I wish youd told me when I did the grocery shopping earlier this week, it would hurt me too much to sit in the car driving around today. Im sorry, can you think of something else to make?\nMom, its  Thanksgiving , we really want pumpkin. Why cant you just drive me to the store real quick?\n\nCan we go to the river? My friends are hiking to the rocky beach with their family to have a picnic and play in the water and  I really want to go.\nBaby, mom had to work yesterday and shes hurting a lot today, hiking at the river wont work out. How about we invite them to come with us on a hike another day when mom is feeling better?\n\nMom, skate with me!

But Ill tell you what, you zoom by me really fast and Ill take a video of you!\nOh, okay I guess.\n\nI could continue, but I hope you get the idea. Making kratom unavailable won't just hurt normal people like me who successfully use it to improve their quality of life with no serious side effects, it would affect their ENTIRE family -  especially their children.

Furthermore, at a time when our country is in the midst of a deadly epidemic of opioid analgesic drug overdoses, we should be exploring alternative pain treatments that do not have the addiction and respiratory suppression properties of opioid analgesics. This is purely sound public health policy, as the necessary data on Kratom needed to make a scheduling decision is not yet available, and will never be available, if it is placed into Schedule 1 as the DEA originally proposed. One only need to look at 2014 testimony of Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, before the Joint Congressional panel on the rescheduling of Cannabis to see how NIDA's lack of ANY scientific data on the long term efficacy and toxicities of Cannabis was a direct result of the prohibition of Cannabis use and the related inability of her agency to support or supply research grade materials to experienced medical researchers wishing to conduct both longitudinal observational studies and placebo controlled clinical trials during the past 70 years. Given the lack of any credible scientific or epidemiologic evidence that the use of Kratom poses an imminent hazard to the public safety, it is my professional opinion as a lifetime Medical Scientist working in the area of recreational drug toxicities and possible effects on co-morbid conditions, that any decision regarding the scheduling of Kratom would be extremely premature and counter productive at this time.

I began taking kratom 2 years ago because I had heard it can help with sleep and anxiety. Mental healthcare in the state of Oklahoma leaves a lot to be desired, so finding something so widely available that could possibly help me was very exciting. I am happy to report that it has helped me personally to manage the anxiety that comes with a full time job, family, and college.\n\nIt has also had a surprising effect on my dietary function. For many years, I have had a form of irregular bowel syndrome. I have had my gallbladder removed, a resulting sphincterotomy to correct a disfunction that developed as a complication of the surgery, and this year a colonoscopy. Several doctors have seen me, but none have successfully diagnosed me. They have prescribed several medications, and while some seem to help with the sphincter spasms, none of them have helped with the IBS syndrome. Over the years, I have come to grips with my condition knowing that a food I ate yesterday that did not affect me, may trigger me today. Once triggered, I suffer high amounts of pain and stress while trying to hold back a bowel movement. I have to visit the restroom 5-6 times within the span of a couple hours which leaves me unable to work. Since taking Kratom on a regular basis, my stool is more regular, my IBS is triggered much less frequently, and I am able to live a much more normal and free life. In the days since the announcement that it may be banned, I have stopped taking it to see the effects. I have had no withdrawal symptoms, however the IBS has returned with fury. Over the last two days I have had vicious bouts of running to the bathroom, each event has lasted several hours, leaving me barely able to function.\n\nIt would greatly sadden me to see Kratom banned due to it's alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine content. It has helped me feel normal and live normal. I would love to see these compounds further researched by the medical community so that their effects can fully benefit others with my same condition. I fear a ban would halt all of the current research as well as nullify all past research into this plant and it's effects. I urge you to consider my story and the positive effects these compounds have had on my life and refrain from banning the potential good that can come from this plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1444","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Townsdin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been so meaningful in my life.

In place of taking those stimulants, benzos, and antidepressants all I simply have to take is Kratom.  Kratom helps me to be able to work in public (which I wasn't able to for years , even on pharmaceuticals) I fear for my future if Kratom becomes illegal or banned. I'm in hopes that it will remain an unscheduled herb that many people can still take for their ailments. It is safe . I've never had any bad reactions  or issues while taking it.

I am a 50-year old female, recovering addict with just over three years clean.\nKratom helps significantly in alleviating chronic pain from a serious injury to my spine that I received in an auto accident.\nKratom has helped me to stay clean from drugs and alcohol for over three years, because it reduces my cravings for opiates and xanax. I also suffer from bipolar 2, with long-term major depressive disorder.  When I got clean, I suffered from long term post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome.  I was severely depressed for over a year. When I discovered kratom, I found it to be a pain relieving, anti-anxiety, anti-depressant that also reduces my cravings for narcotics.  I find it to be a very valuable herbal supplement.  I haven't personally experienced any side effects.  If I stop taking it suddenly, after using it consistently for several months, then my symptoms return, so I feel my physical pain, I may feel anxious, and depressed.  But I don't feel any sort of withdrawal symptoms as I would with opiates or benzo drugs.  \n\nI really feel that kratom should be legal and available to help addicts, alcoholics, and chronic pain patients to recover.  This is because the plant addresses several areas (in my experience): reduces physical pain, reduces psychological cravings, reduces depression and anxiety, increases mental alertness and physical energy. I do believe that the plant should be researched and studied for its many possible benefits.  However, I do NOT believe that it should be positioned as a Schedule 1 narcotic, categorized with heroin.  That is just not accurate.  The plant has too many benefits to be considered a Schedule 1.  Additionally, the potential for abuse, addiction, overdose with kratom is far lower than for heroin or other Schedule 1 substances.  I recognize that some individuals have gotten ill when taking kratom, and even gone to the hospital for overdose, but in each of these circumstances the individuals were mixing kratom with other drugs and/or alcohol.  I don't think it is fair to rush to judgment on kratom just because it was one component in someone's cocktail that caused them to overdose.  \n\nKratom is not a drug. Kratom is not an opiate. Kratom is not a synthetic substance. To compare kratom to \"bath salts\" or to \"spice\" (chemically adulterated compounds) is completely inaccurate!  Naturally occurring Kratom is a safe herbal supplement that's more akin to tea and coffee than any other substances.  Kratom behaves as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and is used for pain management, energy, even depression and anxiety that are so common among Americans. Kratom contains no opiates, but it does bind to the same receptor sites in the brain. Chocolate, coffee, exercise and even human breast milk hit these receptor sites in a similar fashion.\n\nBanning kratom will have devastating effects on many Americans. Chronic pain patients will be forced back on the narcotics that they have been trying to avoid, possible accidental ODs will occur, chronic pain patients who found hope though kratom may become depressed or even suicidal.  Recovering addicts who have found a clean and sober living with kratom may relapse.\n\nThanks so much for taking time to read my thoughts and concerns! \n\nStephanie Sweda Montgomery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19605","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie C Montgomery","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I worked for one of the largest pharmaceutical EDUCATION nonprofits in the United States creating many online education courses for MDs, Nurses and Clinical Professionals.

We need to preserve our rights of choice in using plants given to us naturally or Rx drugs. \nI have some questions for you the DEA snd FDA. \n1) These 15 deaths you speak of. Was Kratom the sole substance in their system? Was there  an underlying health problem(s)? There are zero deaths involving Kratom alone from the research I've done so I'd like to see your source for this.\n2) Schedule 1 means no scientific research can be done. Why that?\n I know for a fact there are pills being made utilizing the 2 main alkaloids so it really looks like y'all are just trying to create a customer base for BigPharma. \n If you guys make kratom illegal I worry a lot for friends I've seen it help and so many veterans.

If I had to rely on prescription opiates I would not be able to do any of those things let alone function.  If Kratom is banned it will literally destroy me.  My fear is that I will be forced to live a life of depression and chronic pain, be unable to work and have to go on disability, which I definitely have no desire to do.  I am a law abiding citizen that only wants to continue to be a productive member of society.  Please do not take away my right to be happy or impede my freedom by enforcing a Kratom ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5227","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Andrew and I had a very serious oxycodone addiction for 4 years. It started with a few percocet a day for the first year and ended up being 300-400 Mg of oxycodone taken orally every day. I did not begin taking them for recreation. It became a real problem in my day to day life and my interactions with the people I love. I had a discussion with my family and friends about it and from that day on I began a suboxone treatment. The suboxone was a miracle. Then after 6 months of suboxone tapering I realized that i became DEPENDENT on the anti drug drugs! I had done a slew of research on Kratom and decided that I'd give it a try. An opiate addict will do anything to not be \"dope\" sick. I began taking Kratom with the guidance of the online community and harm reduction forums. I began to fell normal again. I took kratom daily for a month as needed and finally broke my ties with having to take any kind of medication for my daily routine, I did not become addicted to kratom and recommended it to my close friend who had the same stuggles as I did.

My dosage has actually gone down to one capsule daily. I have had degenerative disc disease in my neck since 1993, treated over the years with numerous visits to physical therapy and muscle relaxers.  Of course doctors have been happy to prescribe anti depressants, NSAIDS, and anti-seizure meds all of which were not a match for me.  I've never taken a narco for my neck pain but was prescribed it for two injuries for short periods.  That's why I know it would work on my neck pain but IT ISN'T A LONG TERM SOLUTION.  KRATOM WORKS!!! (that was the first point I was getting to).  PLEASE ALLOW CONSUMERS TO CONTINUE SAFE CONSUMPTION OF KRATOM IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE IS A THERAPUTIC USE ---I'VE NOT NEEDED TO INCREASE THE DOSE.  Secondly---We need product safety laws to ensure the quality of Kratom and the scrutiny of the markets to provide certified products against pesticides and unsafe growing conditions.  PLEASE DON'T CLOSE THE DOOR ON THIS PAIN RELIEVING PRODUCT, THE COUNTRY'S GROWING AGING POPULATION, AND THE U.S. BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES WITH KRATOM.

I knew I had a problem, but I could not stop on my own, the opiates had their hold on me. It was then that I researched medicines to aid in opiate withdrawal, and found kratom. Once I started using kratom, I felt very little to no desire to go back to opiates, which are much stronger and more dangerous substances. Not only did kratom ease the withdrawal symptoms, it broke me out of the depression that opiate use had brought me. This past year I have been prescribed lyrica/pregabalin for General and Social Anxiety disorder. The medication seemed to have no ill side effects, until a few months ago when I began having minor seizures/muscle spasms. This was unbearable and maddening, as it kept me awake all night when it occurred. It was then that I began trying different supplements to ease my muscles, but nothing helped; until I once again tried kratom. Kratom is absolutely the only medicine I have found that will allow me to sleep at night and prevent my convulsions. This plant is not dangerous. This plant is a medicine with many, very positive therapeutic effects. I owe a lot to kratom, for it has helped immensely in leading me out of dark, depressed places. As with any medicine, abuse can lead to negative effects, but comparing kratom to opiates, kratom is much, much safer to use. Even though kratom can cause withdrawal effects, these effects are very manageable and benign, where as opiates are not nearly as forgiving. Especially at a time like this, where opiate abuse is at an all time high in the United States, we need kratom to be available. This plant has the potential to save millions of lives, but in order to do so the plant must be available to the public, along with unbiased information regarding the use of the plant. I can say from first hand experience that this plant has a gentle, loving nature and poses no threats to humanity, but rather offers solutions to personal problems. Please, for the sake of millions of people's health and well being, do not schedule kratom!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4060","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Souden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not schedule Kratom.

I am 30 years old and a responsible young adult.  There is some misconception of the use of Kratom and it is severely flawed.\nI have suffered from depression and OCD for half of my life now.

No it's not, and I'm not going to claim it is a cure, but what it is, is another tool to get closer to overcoming/subduing it.  It makes thoughts less intrusive and actually gives me motivation to go throughout my day.  Ask anyone with depression if it's easy to get up and put a big smile on your face and to go about your day.  Depression is debilitating for many that suffer from it.  Kratom relieves some of the symptoms that depression causes.\nA few years ago I broke my ankle in 3 places and required multiple surgeries to get it to where it's at now.  I get pains due to the scar tissue/titanium that's screwed into the bone.  Kratom relieves a lot of the discomfort that I get from day to day activities and work.  I am able to get hours of work done around the house because I'm not focusing on how painful my ankle is hurting.  I don't want to get on prescription drugs to help with the pain because Kratom helps without the nasty addiction/side effects.   I also have 3 discs on my lower back that are pinching nerves.  This makes it difficult to kneel down and get yard work/anything involving bending.  \n\nI've never experienced difficulty breathing.  If anything, I focus more and am motivated to do physical activities.  The worst that has happened is that I've gotten a little nauseated after a Kratom dose.

Removal of this plant from our society will leave many suffering from their symptoms (whatever it may be caused by).

I am 36 years old, I am a white male and a married father with an estranged wife.  Ive worked since i was 16 in the food service industry where i worked in the kitchen hard enough and long enough hours to buy my own home which i did in 2009.  Never a sick day, never a vacation day, because at 10 dollars an hour and a little girl, and a house, THAT is not possible.  Opioids and alcohol are the self perscribed medicine of most people in this industry but I was enrolled full time at SCC (Spartanburg Community College) as well, so i couldnt afford to get drunk every night either.  Opiod addiction wasnt an option for me either for several reasons though if I'd wanted to choose that route, it would not have been hard to find the opioids; they're more common in the restaurant industry than in the medical industry, i digress:  I chose not the opiods because I watched many people's lives I knew personally, destroyed by these DEA ordained narcotics.  \n     The food service industry is hell.  There is no way out of it, and no way up and above it while still supporting a house and daughter.  This job was killing me physically, emotionally, and stifling my mental growth.  I was becoming self-destructively depressed and i was beginning to turn to drugs and alcohol because it was all I thought I could afford.  As soon as I had made that decision, I had lost everything and was living the life of a 'functioning alcoholic.\"\n     I heard about Kratom on the internet in a forum around 2009.  I couldn't find a place to buy it until 2013 but in 2013 iI id find a place and I did buy some.  I had no more cravings for alcohol or any other drugs.  I did not feel the overwhelming depression bearing down on me.  I did not feel \"high\" either.  For the first time, i had found an herb that gave me a sensation that can't be described but the only description that comes close is this:  when I ingested the herb it gave me an 'almost'  overwhelming  feeling of 'Normality'.  And that is the only way to describe it.  It is not a high, it is not a recreational escape from reality, it is simply an herb, no mote potent than coffee, that makes you feel 'normal.'  Since then I've used kratom regularly and since then I've broken the bonds of a life of servitude in a dead end job.  I have a meaningful relationship with my daughter that goes beyond working 80 hours a week and coming home sleepy and injured.  God is who I give the credit to, for saving my life, but I believe he used this herb to play a big part in that.  \n     Since then I have introduce kratom to several friends: Kyle, Alex Derry, JoJo, Daniel, Hope and a few others who may not want their identities revealed, but this herb has made an amazing change in their lives as well.  \n     This herb is no more recreationally appealing than vitamins and coffee in the morning,  It is no more intoxicating than espresso.\n     I have opinions on this subject but my opinions deserve the attention of no one in the DEA.  Because of its actions, to attempt to ban a substance which is not proven to be dangerous by any stretch of the definition of dangerous, shows quote plainly and logically that the DEA has alterior motives in banning kratom.   Because this is the only rational reason why they would attempt to ban it kratom.  The DEA has willfully and purposefully tried to overreach and abuse its powers, then pretentiously assumed that it does not need 'reason' based on its idea that We the People are ignorant of the law and its statutes.  This alone watrants an investigation into the DEA itself, and its 'reasoning' for such blatant missuse of the powers with wich it is entrusted.\n     The DEA is an Agency For The People of the U.S.A. not for and of its own sake.  It should not hide anything from the public which it clearly is doing, and that is, its reasoning for this ban.  If there is a just reason for this ban, let it be known and we the people will oblige them.  However, I, as a Citizen of The United States of America am disinclined to acquiesce to their meaningless, fruitless, and irrational ban of an herb that is obviously saving people's lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5765","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Kennedy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 59 years old. I have a master's degree in social work.  I have over 10 years experience working with clients with addiction.  I suffer from arthritis, fibromyalgia, PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  About six years ago, my doctor tried to help me due to my worsening physical and mental health, after I had experienced severe trauma.  I was prescribed both Norco and Tramadol due to widespread pain that traveled all over my back, hips, neck, and shoulders, and also Xanax for anxiety and severe panic attacks that took me to ER. I developed terrible fatigue, felt like I was dragging myself around.  These were among several other medications tried as my doctor attempted to help, such as Lyrica, Cymbalta, and three different kinds of anti-depressants. None of them helped me with pain, depression, or anxiety, but I did experience many negative side effects such as weight gain, and strange electrical jolts in my head that frightened me when I tapered off them because they didn't help. My doctor had to take me off of work because I could no longer responsibly perform my duties. I was very devastated to lose my ability to do the job I loved. I saw a therapist of my own for a year. I tried everything I knew to do.  I was meditating daily, walking my dog every day, gentle yoga, healthy diet, etc., I was so determined to regain my health.   With the third anti-depressant I tried I experienced a severe reaction, and it was a supreme effort for me to resist the urge to commit suicide. I am lucky to be alive.  I stopped trying those meds. due to a healthy fear of them. Rather than insisting on my seeing a psychiatrist as I feared, my doctor agreed these meds. do not help everyone, and are not safe for everyone.  After a few years of narcotic pain medications on a regular basis, I felt my tolerance had risen, and after doubling my dose a couple times, and knowing what I know, I decided these medications were not helping much anymore, and I hated the risks.  I was barely functioning, increasingly isolated, but not willing to ask the doctor to increase the dose because I knew that would just increase the risks. Not only did the pain and anxiety return whenever I didn't take them, but seemed doubled. I  had symptoms of withdrawal such as restleg leg syndrome and bad insomnia whenever I stopped completely for a couple of days.  I felt hopeless that I would never be drugfree, but simple unable to tolerate the doubled return of pain and anxiety. I felt desperate and began researching supplements and ethnobotanicals without much hope, but then I found articles about kratom.   I decided to try kratom as a supplement to not only see if it would help ease those withdrawal symptoms, but hoped to ease some of the pain, fatigue, and anxiety that was negatively impacting my life so much.  I had not taken any Norco or Xanax for over 48 hours that first time.  Many recommended to be careful with dosing as kratom can cause nausea and dizziness if you take too much.  The first time I took 3 grams of powdered leaf stirred into water.  The taste was awful, but I choked it down due to my desperation.  In the back of my mind I was already planning to give up, to even ask my doctor for something stronger.  I was astounded!  In 30 minutes, I experienced an easing of the pain and withdrawal symptoms that felt like several big knots slowly untied in my back, a lift in my energy level, similar to several cups of coffee, but without a jittery feeling. I also felt a lift in my spirits! With the assistance of kratom, I would be able to make it through another day without Norco, Tramadol, or Xanax, and hoped never again. I have been taking kratom on a daily basis for a full year now.  I usually take 4-5 grams twice per day. I don't feel any desire to take more.  I am proud to remain clean from Norco, Tramadol, and Xanax.  I am not cured of fibromyalgia, arthritis, PTSD, or depression, but with the assistance of kratom, meditation, daily walks, and healthy diet, my symptoms are more manageable now.  I am able to do more, and just received results of a blood test, and my doctor said my liver enzymes are wonderfully low. I also lost 25 pounds. My family and friends have noticed the improvement in me.  Mother Nature has given us wonderful medicinal plants. The terrible opiate epidemic is killing so many, and this safe mild plant is literally saving thousands of lives. I appreciate this comment period.  This plant is safely helping so many people that scientifically and ethically a ban makes no sense! Compared to \"legal\" alcohol, kratom is a thousand times safer to me. It belongs in the category of supplements.  I am truly afraid, and not only for myself, but as a professional!  Kratom must be kept easily available to the public.  Scientists and doctors can study and make recommendations over time, but you must leave it easily available for those who need it right now. It's an emergency.

Headshops will find a new drug to sell, and it will probably be something deadly instead of an innocuous plant that isn't even an effective recreational drug.

As you might imagine his job has caused him a number of chronic pain and inflammation issues. About a year ago he started using opiates, Percocet and hydrocodone primarily,  and quickly developed a strong habit. He's not a full blown addict, but i know he has withdrawals from the drugs and it often impedes on prior plans we have together. It's like watching someome you care about slowly fade away and not being able to do anything about it. A couple months ago however, a coworker introduced him to kratom and he has been steadily weening himself from his opiate habit ever since. This could not have come at a better time since he has a baby boy dus in December. I've seen first hand the benefits kratom can have in regards to opiate weening. The most severe side effect I ever saw from Caleb using kratom was the first time he took it. He took a few too many and had a stomach ache for an hour or so. The side effects of kratom are NOT dangerous. The only thing making kratom illegal will do is push people like Caleb pack into opiate use. Put yourself in the shoes of someone with a loved one who suffers from opiate addiction. How would you feel if something that helped them recover from that addiction was no longer available?

Upon reviewing the literature on kratom and mitragynine (Appendix A), I see a number of key challenges to the potential scheduling of kratom (Mitragyna speciose) or its constituents.  I summarize my thoughts below, with the hope that they will be informative.\n\n(1) Epidemiologic evidence demonstrating abuse potential \n\nThe literature on kratom addiction consists of cross-sectional studies of existing users1,2 and case reports.3,4 These studies cannot assess the risk of dependency associated with kratom, and can only provide prevalence counts. No longitudinal studies exist to estimate the risk of dependency among novel users of kratom, thus how likely it is to be abused remains unknown. \n\n(2) Epidemiologic evidence of adverse events \n\nThe literature on kratom or mitragynine safety is composed of poison control center studies5-8 and case-reports.9-22 Neither of these study designs provides a denominator from which to assess risk. It is unknown how many people were exposed to kratom in the areas served by these poison control centers and clinical facilities. \n\n(3) Epidemiologic evidence of medical uses for kratom or its constituents \n\nCiting three online communities, Prozialeck (2016) states that kratom's therapeutic potential is \"too large to be ignored\".23 Indeed, the comments on this docket reveal that many people experience benefits from kratom. However, there are no published clinical trials investigating the potential for kratom or mitragynine to treat, prevent, or cure any disease.24 It is not the case that kratom has been found to have no therapeutic value - it is simply the case that it has yet to be formally studied for its clinical value at all.23 As a reminder, a lack of published evidence is not synonymous with evidence supporting the null. \n\n(4) Comparative safety and effectiveness of mitragynine for pain relief\n\nUnfortunately, no studies exist to demonstrate the comparative effectiveness, safety, or abuse potential between commonly prescribed opioid drugs and kratom. It would be interesting and especially useful to be able to compare the pain relief and addiction potential (risk of dependency) between these compounds. \n\n(5) Scheduling poses a barrier to important research\n\nClinical studies of controlled substances are hindered by the amount of complexity Scheduling adds to the conduct of research.23,25  Mitragynine is a molecule of deep, inherent scientific interest.26 Scheduling will devastate further scientific advancements, advancements that could benefit public health more dramatically and positively than a Schedule 1 ban. Banning this substance will prevent us from ever knowing how much relief it could have brought to millions of people suffering from pain daily. My hope is that regulation that balances concerns about consumer safety, pain relief, and scientific advancement is possible.  \n\n(6) Pain sufferers are already using this substance as an alternative to opiates \n\nIf the intent to classify kratom/mitragynine as Schedule 1 has done anything, it has revealed that many people are currently deriving positive benefit from the use of this plant without complaint.  The 19,000+ comments on this docket reveal an understudied phenomenon, and provide insights in contrast with the published literature (which mainly describes potentially anomalous addictions and adverse events). For people who are currently using kratom for pain with no adverse effects, alternative treatments include substances that are known to be highly addictive and dangerous. High doses of kratom do not appear to cause respiratory depression, and in a mouse model kratom provides \"marked analgesic effects but with far fewer side effects, slower development of tolerance, and lower potential for dependence than morphine.\"23 For what cause would we imply that individuals who are currently deriving harmless benefit from kratom switch to opiates? \n\nIn scientific and medical affairs it is incumbent upon us to have empathy for the people we serve. In the case of kratom, users include people who are currently deriving benefits from the plant without harm. We must partner with these individuals - who at this time might feel alienated by the medical establishment - to develop a thorough, grounded understanding of kratom and its implications, and a regulatory plan that supports health for all.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful attention,\n\nSarah R.

Daily living in hell and trying to take care of a family wasn't easy. I lost my health coverage when I became unemployed due to my mental health and I'm so thankful I did. I never would have found the life saving plant Kratom. Immediately after receiving the plant my pain was manageable again, much better than with the pills my Drs gave me. My head wasn't cloudy, my mood was no longer aggressive like it was on the Percocet they made me take 6 times a day! I wasn't constipated, I no longer hid in my home, I was able to socialize, eat better, be happy. Being happy wasn't even a flittering thought before Kratom. Within a year I no longer needed a single medication, I have a full time job again, and 5 years later I've never felt better. Not one episode of depression, no bi polar episodes, no anxiety, no lingering pain, nothing bad. All good. I've never thought of Kratom as a drug, because drugs destroy lives not fix them. Please don't take this away from the ones that depend upon it to allow them to live a natural lifestyle. I'd be ok with regulations and testing like you do with marijuana but keep it so it can be further tested through science, and we can learn from it and its benefits. Learn what it does to our bodies, learn if their will be long term side effects. Study it, but don't steal it away just so big pharma can win while all the people having to rely on big pharma loose.

I suffered from severe sleep deprivation, widespread pain, cognitive dysfunction and depression as a result. The illness was so debilitating that I wondered if I'd ever lead a normal life. I was currently working on a bachelors and questioned whether it was even worth it to finish. I barely had the will to live.  \n\nI am now a 34 year old wife and mother of one. I managed to obtain a Bachelors in Media Arts and move to New York, where I currently work as a commercial director. My most recent clients include Marc Jacobs, Lululemon, Crate and Barrel and MOMA. I am also a mentor in the big brother big sister program. Thanks to this wonderful herb, my quality of life has improved dramatically and I have been able to contribute to society in the same ways as someone without such an illness. By taking kratom, I feel less pain, sleep better, am more focused, alert and have the energy to keep up with my routine. Not a day goes by without the acknowledgement that I'd never have the type of joy and success in my life if I hadn't taken a chance on Kratom after I'd tried so many other harmful chemical substances.   \n\nKratom has played a huge part in my recovery and I won't deny that I am dependent on it. However, the side effects pale in comparison to any other prescription medications I have taken, especially narcotics such as hydrocodone, which I found myself dependent on not just for its pain relieving properties, but for the \"high\" that it gave me. The healing properties of kratom are unlike anything I've seen before, specifically because the side effects are practically non-existent. Knowing that I'm not harming my liver and mind with addictive synthetic opiates gives me great piece of mind. I am not a smoker, drinker or drug user. I have no criminal record. \n\nTo say that I am terrified of the ban would be an understatement. While I've learned to manage my illness tremendously through diet, exercise and herbal supplements, by far the greatest relief comes from drinking this tea. I am an extremely devoted wife and mother and am fearful that I won't be able to be there for my family in nearly the same capacity without having it on bad days. As a child of a mother who suffers from the same illness, I know what a great impact it has on a child. \n\nI understand that the DEA is dealing with a tremendous opiate epidemic in this country and  that they must act with a sense of urgency in combatting anything that might contribute to this problem. However, all the evidence suggests that banning kratom would have the opposite effect by giving suffering individuals no other choice than to turn to opiates to alleviate their symptoms. At this point, it seems completely illogical to move forward with this move. I urge you to consider the impact this will have on so many hard working Americans. The last thing we need is to be incarcerating mothers and fathers over something that poses no tangible threat to society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18668","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christina Ladwig","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Richard Meden I am 65 years old and a retired engineer. I am writing in regards to the proposed listing of Kratom as a schedule 1 drug. \nI have been using Kratom for about 2 years. It was referred to me by a friend that was familiar with it.\nAt the time, I had been suffering from pain due to being injured while playing tennis. I had tremendous muscle aches and could not stand or sit for prolonged periods of time. I could not sleep for more than 2 hours at a time. I would take 5, 200 mg tablets of Ibuprofen before bed and 2 every time I woke up.\nI went to the doctor for stronger pain relief and received a prescription for Oxycodone. This relieved the pain but is an addictive drug. After 2 weeks of taking the this prescription the pain was still there when I didn't use it.\nThat is when I tried the Kratom. It relieved the pain to extent that I could sleep the entire night and was fairly pain free during the day. It took about another 2 months for my body to heal. When the pain was gone I had no problem not taking the Kratom. There were no addictive side affects whatsoever. I am not sure it would have worked out the same had I been taking the Oxycodone for that length of time. I now use Kratom occasionally since I am an active person to relieve muscle soreness.\n I believe  that to Place this as a schedule 1 drug would be a mistake. I have had great success using Kratom with no ill affects. Also, as a schedule 1 drug, there would be no medical research being done. With the current opioid epidemic in this country, to exclude Kratom as a viable substitute is not in the interest of the American people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18697","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Meden","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am against the ban on Kraton for so many reasons.

Several years ago she had worsening depression and anxiety where everything from Paxil, to lexapro, to Zoloft in conjunction with Xanax, klonopin, ambien, and more. This did not help and I believe made things worse. This killed me to see. The person I loved so much having to live with these terrible mental conditions was too much for me. I found kratom. I pleaded with my mom that she give it a try especially given its history of use throughout human history, the benign nature let alone it's benign nature relative to all these other medications. She relented after a 5-10 minute conversation. From that day forward she is depression/anxiety free, insomnia free. I can't express to you how ecstatic I was to see this. \n\nPlease don't take this away from everyone that it has been a miracle for. There is no public safety issue whatsoever.

This is simply wrong and I the only reason for this that I can come up with is pursuit of the interests of some segment of the pharmaceutical industry. How can this be done with such little scientific study/cost benefit analysis, meetings with people who have found this miracle.\n\nMyself and so many in similar situations are very frightened and baffled.

At the age of 10, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease.  Ever since my first symptoms and being diagnosed, my doctors told me that it was a sever case, and not at all typical.  I've tried a litany of medications ranging from Asacol, Mercaptopurine, Remicade, Humira, Methotrexate, Cimzia and Prednisone.  All of which have extremely dangerous side-effects.  Despite such an extensive range of treatments, nothing had ever worked for me.\nThe first symptom I ever had was a fistula, which is an excruciatingly painful infection that needs to be cut open (every time without anesthesia), and I've had between 7-8 of these over the past 15 years.  I've also had two major surgeries, removing portions of my intestines.  The first was due to my disease ravaging my intestines and causing scarring, the second was to remove a portion of scar tissue build-up where the original surgery was done.  My everyday symptoms were extreme fatigue, pain, and excessive diarrhea (sometimes going past 15 times a day).  Just six months after my first surgery, my symptoms began to return, and I completely gave up on treatment by the time I was 22 years old.\nIt was around that time that I found out about Kratom, and I've taken it every day for roughly the past four years.  My symptoms were and are for the first time, completely managed, and I've finally returned to normality.  My GPA before taking Kratom a meager 3.1, and after finally feeling normal again and returning to school at the University of Kentucky, I now have a 3.8 GPA and have been on the Dean's list both of the semesters that I've attended thus far and I don't intend to mess it up!  \nBefore this, I was on-and-off extremely strong and addictive pain medications, amphetamines for fatigue, and diarrhea medications which made me feel subhuman, and I absolutely hated it.  I've also built up a tolerance to those medications over the years, where in comparison, I've taken Kratom for four years and have yet to build any significantly noticeable tolerance (similar to tolerance to coffee).  Futhermore, the chronic nature of my disease, I have been getting constant bloodwork, and since taking Kratom my health and test results have only improved.  In fact, during the surgery I had just this past May, 2016, it was found that there are no signs of active Crohn's disease, and I am for the first time in remission from the disease (it's possible there's a correlation between Kratom and my remission, but I can't sincerely claim causation without there being research done).\nThat is all why I believe Kratom should not be at all scheduled, and instead, vendors instead be required to include an age prerequisite of 18 years old, as well as warnings to confer with one's physician if taking any medications.  In my experience Kratom is only about as addictive as coffee, and the withdrawal symptoms are also similar to that of caffeine withdrawal (although differing in nature).  Whereas cigarettes and alcohol have literally no medical benefit, are highly addictive, and kill hundreds of thousands of people every year in just the U.S. alone, probably in the millions world-wide (all of which would more than qualify for Schedule 1).  I'm aware that there are a few cases of deaths, but these are almost always due to mixing Kratom with other more powerful drugs.  There always was and always will be idiots, but we should not have our liberty or right to live a normal life be taken because of a few peoples' stupidity.\nIn closing, for the first time I have enough energy to exercise, which contributes to my overall well-being.  I rarely have diarrhea, and so I'm now capable of eating a healthy diet and a variety of fruits and vegetables (which would cause severe diarrhea before Kratom), and my digestion is also slow enough to where I can absorb the nutrition they provide.  And most importantly, I'm now capable of expressing my full potential at school and have the ability to become a productive member of society.  \n\nPlease, I implore you, do not take this away from me.  And I'm absolutely certain there are thousands of other people in our country just like me, with a variety of ailments that are more bearable because of Kratom.\n\nSincerely,\nAlan Zgoda\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0631","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alan Zgoda","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Nicole Im 36 years old and married with 3 year old twin boys. I am currently a dance instructor but was a professional dancer for 10 years. I had a really bad fall when dancing with a male partner back in 2002 which caused several injuries. Now 14 years later I suffer from chronic pain in my lower back as well as my neck. Ive seen approximately 10 different doctors and specialists over the years trying to find help.  All theyve done for me is prescribe pain killers. I eventually got to the point where my body became tolerant to these medications and I had to keep taking more and more to feel any kind of relief. My body became addicted and I became very ill and my quality of life was AWFUL! These harsh pain killers/chemicals I was using quit helping with pain and began causing even more problems such as depression and addiction, which was terrible when having to take care of my precious  twin baby boys. So about 2 years ago I decided to do some research on my own to try to find some kind of natural and obviously much healthier option to relieve my 24/7 excruciating pain and give me back my life. That is when I came upon Kratom. I read all sorts of  information on  this amazing natural resource and couldn't find one negative thing about it so I decided to give it a try. Since day one of taking it my life changed dramatically. The pain went from around an 8 to about a 3/2 and my depression was gone. And another great thing about it is that It doesnt make me feel weird, dizzy, high, nauseous or anything else like prescription pain meds do. For the first time in many many years I literally felt NORMAL which is an AMAZING feeling! I really dont know what would happen to my life if this got taken away. Needless to say, Im terrified!!! I dont ever want to go back to living a life full of pain, depression and sickness. Please understand what a wonderful, natural resource our creator has given us.

It has done more for me than any doctor or pill has done for me as far as pain relief.  I have gotten many shots in the lumbar and have been prescribed opiates and they only worked short term and had limitations on use.  I feel that everyone has the right to natural pain relief, instead of constant bombardment of pharmaceuticals and other man-altered products for pain relief.  I feel that this is wrong to make Kratom illegal as it does not pose anywhere near the threat that most of your legal pharmaceutical drugs do that are on the market.  In fact, I feel the benefits far out weigh the risks by more of a margin than any pharmaceutical out there.  I think this ahs giving me pain relief and freedom from opiate pills and high medical bills due to lumbar shots.  This is something I think people need to rid themselves of the opiate problem in the country and should be a great ally in that respect.  This has been around for many, many generations all the way back to ancient times.  It has been a blessing for me and my family because I am more active for my children since I am not taking pain pills.  Kratom is the best possible pain relief for me and should be embraced as such among our medical professionals.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6489","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Fuller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear respected DEA staff,\n\nI would kindly ask you to re-consider your proposed change of status of the commonly known Asian ground leaf \"kratom.\"\n\nI find the effect of kratom to be very similar to coffee or a strong tea like Earl Grey. The one difference I've noticed is that the energizing effect is less nervous system stimulation and more physical endurance action seemingly.  I can say the lack of acid stomach is also a plus. \n\nI am sixty-four years old and welcome the effects of kratom on days when the \" honey do\" list gets physical and prolonged.\n\n I should mention the one negative I've can report and that is on occasion the mildly rapid heartbeat which is exactly what I'm experiencing at this moment from two strong cups of coffee earlier this morning, (only an indicator that I should back off on the dose of coffee or kratom whichever is in play) except I have good heart health and probably won't.\n\n\nTo sum up, I would hope that kratom remains legal and available to those who wish to consume the product without any fear of addiction, mind-alteration or illegal activity, happily exclusive of other kinds of illegal substances well-known to you.\n\nThank you for your consideration and common sense on this subject.

Before i wasn't able to work... now I work full time, pay my taxes, and was able to regain my life again. Please do not ban kratom! I urge you! I don't want to lose my life again to pain and pain medications. Kratom is a life saving herb and as tax paying adults we should have every right to use this medicinal herb. Please don't take my life from me. \n\nSincerely, Cameron D Juarez","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6285","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cameron Juarez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has saved my life.

Since then, I have been using the dried, powdered mitragyna speciosa leaf as an energy stimulant for work almost every day (85+% of the time). I work as a mid-level business analyst in a large, multi-billion dollar corporation. I also have been diagnosed with adult ADHD, and have a prescription for this diagnosis. Mitragyna speciosa has allowed me to take less of my ADHD medication, which helps me a lot because my ADHD medication has negative side effects on me, such as a loss of appetite, insomnia, and being much less social. The one time that I did take too much mitragyna speciosa, it made me dizzy and a bit nauseous, kind of like the feeling you get when you've had way too much caffeine. If I can use this chemical almost daily for 4 years and A) not become addicted and B) not have any serious side effects, it deserves to be given more time to be researched. I did stop using it for a 3 month period earlier this year because I wanted to see if I would experience any withdrawal effects, but there were no withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIt makes no sense to me that alcohol is allowed to be consumed by anyone 21 or older, and nicotine can be used by anyone 18 or older, but this plant is going to be illegal for anyone and will be classified alongside drugs such as LSD and heroine. Instead of making a rash and extreme decision, why not put some basic regulations in place that more closely align with similar substances? Such as, instituting a minimum age requirement for usage of, say, 18 or older. Also, some rules on what types of mitragyna speciosa can be sold and used in the U.S. should be implemented, because I've noticed a large surge in the number of manufacturers selling knock-off and fake mitragyna speciosa which is dangerous to consumers. I also believe that concentrated and lab-enhanced versions of the chemical should not be allowed to be produced and sold without FDA approval, and lab-altered versions of mitragyna speciosa should be considered a prescription drug.\n\nWith all the insanity going on in politics today, I really hope that the many researchers, doctors, law enforcement officers,  and lawyers involved in this ruling will show by their decision that reason and sanity are not completely absent from government.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6794","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"andrew e","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Moving Kratom to the schedule 1 list will be a very very bad thing for this country.

I have been taking Kratom for over 8 years now and at one time I really didn't go out of my house and had only a friend or two. I was very awkward around people and would go into deep anxiety quickly. Being in buildings or driving my car was difficult as I felt trapped and a suffocation feeling and now am able to carry these actions out like a normal person. I have also suffered from Dyslexia and ADHD and have always had a difficult time with studying and focus usually ending in poor grades. Since Kratom, I now have three bachelors degrees and a masters degree and plan on going back to school for my second master and a doctrine in cognitive psychology. The last thing Kratom helps me with is pain. About 2 years ago I got ran over by a pickup truck while riding my bicycle. I have to have major hip surgery to which I still have pain every day.

I am responsible a 28 year old father, husband, and small business owner (Crucial Crystals LLC).\nI am commenting to ask that kratom NOT become a scheduled drug, especially because of the fact that it holds vast medical potential. If anything, I think 18 and up would be appropriate as my state of North Carolina has already decided.\nI started using kratom a little over 1 year ago when a colleague of mine comment on how much it aided his attention concerning computer based work and lowered his anxiety levels when dealing with the public (both things that are the main portions of my every day life). \nI was prescribed ritalin when I was 7 (which is absurd) and adderall during high school. Both of these drugs had a medely of negative side effects in my life that still affect me to this day. Kratom however operates in the background of my mind, almost unnoticeable, with no negative side affects after 1 year of use. My concentration is finally on par with the rest of the world, my anxiety is almost non-existent, and my time spend with my daughter is really much better not spacing out all of the time. If this plant were to be taken away from me, almost every aspect of my life would suffer just a little.\nIn Conclusion I am asking you with all of my heart to leave kratom legal to those 18 and up. This plant has a wide range of medical applications far beyond the one's I have described. The impact it has in my life on a daily basis is literally priceless: My job, my family, my own mental health, are all better because of it.\nThank you SO much for listening to all of us so far, the attention given to our comments means the world to me.\nSincerely,\nJonathan Herbert Gonglach","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2049","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Gonglach","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Angela Vazquez, 47, Dog Service Business Owner\n\nI'm opposing the DEA putting Kratom on the schedule 1 list of controlled substances because it has truly helped my life in the last 2 years.\n\nI began using kratom after a year of researching a natural anxiety suppressant. I've tried different types of teas, vitamins, foods exercises, and  therapy.

I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia more than a decade ago, when I was just 23 years old. I'm not sure what was more devastating- learning that the pain & fatigue I had been suffering with wasn't going away & would get worse- or feeling like a useless zombie from the numerous drugs the physician prescribed, that were supposed to give me a better \"quality of life\". For years I stayed on those medications, trying to find a balance between the overwhelming fog they caused & the searing pain my body was in. Then I stopped. I stopped taking everything my doctor's insisted I needed, because I couldn't live with the guilt of never feeling present for my four year old daughter. Physical pain seemed preferable to being sedated to the point that I was virtually non-reactive emotionally. I thought my child seeing me stuck on the couch because my body felt like every muscle I had was tearing itself away from the bone, was somehow better than her seeing me incoherent because of all the medicine. That has been my life, our life, since then....until last year, when I found Kratom. The time my doctors warned me about- when I would have to decide whether I'd take my prescriptions & be able to participate physically in life, or not take them & be more alert mentally, only to find myself focused on the pain- had long since come & gone. I was miserable. Desperate for a solution, I began to research. Giving Kratom a try took a leap of faith due to all the misinformation on the internet, but I'm so glad I had the courage to. For the first time in YEARS, I felt good physically without feeling foggy mentally. It was life changing. I know Kratom isn't curing or healing me, because nothing can- but on the days I can't manage to force myself to suffer through, it does help me fight back against my body sabotaging itself, without sacrificing emotional & mental clarity & without risking addiction to the dangerous narcotics that are often the only option for those suffering from Fibromyalgia. I shouldn't have to go back to the life I was living. A life where I had to choose between unbearable pain or often deadly medications. Not a single person has died from Kratom alone, in the hundreds of years people have been benefiting from it. The same cannot be claimed by even the most \"benign\", unregulated FDA & DEA approved medications that are supposed to alleviate pain, such as acetaminophen- which continues to kill more & more people every year, in addition to causing an increasing number of liver failures. How could anyone think the prescriptions that take tens of thousands of lives are better or safer than a plant that has zero evidence of causing even one fatality? Opioid dependence is an epidemic in this country. Thousands of children are losing their parents to these \"safe\", \"doctor prescribed\" medications & my government is threatening to ban a natural alternative that countless people benefit from, without the horrid risks associated with narcotics? Eliminating access to Kratom would shatter, not only their lives, but also the lives of their loved ones who are now able to have them active & present for the day to day things that illness used to make impossible. \nI understand that Kratom is different & therefore difficult for some people to comprehend its effectiveness, but different doesn't mean dangerous & it certainly doesn't mean deadly. We must stop reacting & definitely stop regulating, out of fear & ignorance. \nWith great power comes great responsibility. Surely the DEA doesn't want to be responsible for the pain, suffering & addiction to narcotics that many hard working Americans would be forced into if Kratom were no longer an option?\nMake no mistake, that would be the result of banning this safe, natural, coffee-like plant. \n\n\nSincerely,\nGinger Sims","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9621","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ginger Sims","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern\n   Kratom is saving peoples lives everyday and giving many people back thier quality of life.

So even after the miracle drug Acutane my anxiety and self confidence have been a huge issue of mine even after being acne free.  So I tried a few anti-depressants to help with my anxiety and my depression.  The anti-depressants helped at first then eventually made me far worse in every way.  So I knew I had to quit ASAP.  One day I went with a friend to a smoke shop after he told me about this herb called Kratom that naturally helps with depression and anxiety.  So I got some to try to find out it instantly took away my anxiety and anxiousness.  Not only did Kratom do that it also makes me very happy and just love life.  Kratom also works very well with helping with the soreness of Bodybuilding which is something I have been doing for 10 years and now taking Kratom I can workout the next day soreness free.  I have never had a opiote addiction so Kratom is more of my medicine to help with my anxiety, anxiousness and my depression.  Kratom has been a miracle for me it has helped me in so many ways just like it has with many other people.  Kratom is such a safe herb it is nothing like normal opiotes where if you take too much you throw up instead of dying like you would with normal opiotes.  The only side effects that are really know for Kratom are bumps like acne or it can make you constipated which is very easily avoided by taking 3 tablespoons of coconut oil a day.  Not only does that take away the red bumps it also reversed the constipation effects Kratom can cause.  I have been taking Kratom for over 2 years I have never experienced any health conditions whatsoever all this time.  So do not take this herb away it is nothing like the drugs that are on this list this herb has been used for thousands of years for it amazing benefits.  Kratom is a miracle herb for opiote addicts, people with depression, people with anxiety, people with self confidence issues and many many other reasons.  If you ban this thousands or even more people are going to die or get hooked on horrible drugs that will kill them or lead them to a downhill spiral ruining their lives.  Please please do not ban Kratom it is not a DRUG but a herb that saves lives, helps with depression, anxiety, anxiousness, and stops hardcore drug addicts quit hardcore drugs.

My life is beyond anything I could've expected out even could imagine.  I thought my life was going to be stuck shackled to heroin letting it slowly kill me. Today o can say that's not the case. I'm happy and I'm a productive member of society and I owe it all to kratom. With out it I no doubt would be dead.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3041","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brian Perc","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Keaton for the better part of two years. A few years ago I was diagnosed with degenerative disk disease and retro athesis. The doctors at the time were treating me with OxyContin and naproxen, just a few months later the 5mg icy had progressed into 10mg and then 20mg. So in just six months I was taking 80-100mg a day of a dangerously addictive drug. I am a father of three and a civil servent for the city of NY department of environmental protection. I could not afford to loose everything over a  medically sanctioned addiction. I found a legitimate alternative, Kratom. Since I have started using kratom I no longer feel addicted. I can go without it and even though I'm in pain I don't \"have\" to have it. I have been more productive at work and at home. My mood has improved and my overall health has improved as well. Please do not ban this herbal treatment. Regulation I can understand, but I believe banning kratom would be a detriment to my life and the lives of millions of others like me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6479","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jon Morton curry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Daryl,\nFor the sake of brevity I'll keep it short.\nI used to drink entirely too much alcohol every day.\nI was told about Kratom one day and gave it a try. \nI later realized that same evening that I wasn't drinking or even wanting to drink at all.\nI relaxes me and makes me less anxious which is very nice.\nIt has also made me more productive in general. \n\nThanks for the consideration, \nDaryl","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16651","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daryl Elliott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"How can you justify taking away a natural plant that can help people get through the day without depending on a man made substance,  I use kratom to help alleviate pain caused from a life long illness, degenerative bone deterioration in my hips,  at times the pain is so bad I can't walk,.\nWhen I was 5 the doctors said it was growing pains, when I was 16 they said it was arthritis and put me on 800 milligram motrin, and for 20 years the helped to get me by, but in my mid 30s when I couldn't take the pain any longer, waking up every night 3am in such bad pain i had to run the hottest bath I could handle , I would lay in it to number my hips and go back to sleep, in the tub.\nThis was an every night ordeal, I finally decided to go back in  and be diagnosed once again, this time with degenerative bone deterioration in my hips.\nThey put me on vicodin, and for 5 years it worked, except for the fact my body would get used to the dose and I would eventually have to take more.\nI decided to do research on natural relief, and found kratom, I started taking kratom and it would give me relief from the pain enough to not have to take the vicodin, and now 5 plus years later my body has not grown uses to it and require more to help with the pain like it did with vicodin,  in fact I use the same amount now as I started 5 years ago.\nPlease don't turn me back into a pill junkie.

I have recently watched a documentary about the plant, and I believe the scheduling needs to be reconsidered.  As far as I understand Kratom has been scheduled as a schedule 1 drug.  I believe more facts about the drug need to be researched and published before such a scheduling takes place.  Scheduling Kratom as a schedule 1 drug places many people in unneccesary legal danger.  It would be a disservice to the public to take a knee-jerk reaction to this potentially helpful plant.  \n    Please allow the necessary research with this plant.

With the current opiate epidemic it is simply a matter of time before Kratom becomes a nation wide major problem.  It affects you just like vicodin.  That is why all of these opiate addicts are telling you they were able to stop abusing pills with Kratom.  Its because kratom acts exactly like the pills!  They have a version of vicodin that they can get at the local head shop so of course they wont need the pills.  Kratom is relatively unknown at this point.   This will be an EPIDEMIC if it is not controlled by some sort of schedule whether it is I or III or IV.  It doesnt really matter as long as you need to take the step to get it from a doctor instead of freely at the store.

It has been my experience that when young adults, under the influence of the latest designer drug, begin presenting to our emergency departments with increasing frequency, an expedited updating of our drug legislation is in order in the interest of public health.\n\nWhile the relatively recent emergency scheduling of synthetic cathinones (\"bathsalts\") and synthetic cannabinoids (\"spice\"), left me nodding my head in agreement with the policy decision, the proposed emergency scheduling of kratom has conversely left me scratching my head.  Unlike the aforementioned controlled substance analogues, which are synthesized by illicit labs in an attempt to circumvent existing drug laws, kratom is a natural leaf, which has been quietly consumed by people around the world since the dawn of civilization.\n\nIn my work, I encounter overdoses of all types on an almost daily basis.  Over many thousands of patient encounters, I have yet to record a single patient encounter that was the result of an overdose or adverse reaction to kratom. The experiences of my colleagues, with whom I have discussed this issue, mirror my own.  \n\nWhile I am not a primary care physician, and thus do not have long-term relationships with my patients, I have also met a handful of patients who have used kratom, and felt compelled to discuss this with me.  These patients seemed to genuinely feel that kratom was an asset in their lives.  Some patients were using the plant to assuage chronic pain, while others were using it as a means to avoid using \"harder\" substances such as heroin and alcohol.  Given the current nationwide epidemic of opiate abuse and addiction, I feel this latter point is especially important. \n\nSince the intended emergency scheduling announced at the end of August, a significant number of patients have come forward, and  it has become apparent to me that there is a significant number of diverse individuals, ranging from wounded vets with PTSD, to the elderly with chronic arthritis pain, who are quietly using kratom as a means to alleviate their symptoms.  It has also become clear that these people are legitimately afraid that the government will step into their lives, seeming out of the blue, and leave them suffering.\n\nOn a personal note, I have both friends and family that use kratom for different reasons, and this is what initially directed my attention to this issue.  Speaking from the perspective of a friend and family member, it has been experience that they have used, and continue to use, the plant responsibility.  The proposed scheduling in August has caused them quite a bit of consternation, which as ultimately compelled me to speak out regarding my personal and professional experiences with kratom.\n\nGiven the long history of human use of this plant, and the large number of Americans who feel it helps make their lives manageable, I feel FDA regulation of plain kratom leaf as a dietary supplement with an age restriction may be a reasonable path for the plant to take at this juncture.  This would  allow the many individuals who derive benefit from kratom to continue to use it without fear of criminal penalty, while an ongoing and more comprehensive safety monitoring protocol can be instituted.  Furthermore, proper regulation could possibly encompass keeping kratom from being inappropriately sold in gas stations and smoke shops as a \"legal high,' where it is often sold as a concentrated alkaloid extract that may even be combined with other unknown ingredients.\n\nAs both a concerned citizen and a physician, I would like to see our federal agencies step in to help the individual citizen consumer, with a focus on harm-reduction, industry regulation, product safety, and education--without resorting to draconian drug policy and criminalization of vulnerable populations.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration;\n\nCalifornia Emergency Physician\n\n**Due to the privacy concerns of patients, friends and family, I have elected to post this comment in semi-anonymous fashion.

In regards to Docket No. DEA-442W I can only hope that you seriously reconsider and take into account my opinions. Everyone has their own lengthy story when it comes to Kratom, myself included. For the sake of not losing your attention, the summarized version is that I was a heroin addict at one point. I started self-medicating with pain killers as a means of combating depression and then eventually graduated to heroin when I was 22-23 years old. With no \"light at the end of the tunnel\" and constant relapses it was just a living nightmare on a continuous cycle. That was until I somehow found out about Kratom. Even then I didn't believe it was going to help but I had nothing else to lose and thankfully I decided to try it. Because I haven't used heroin since, my dedication to quitting heroin coupled with Kratom was more then enough to change my life and start rebuilding. Obviously this is just a super condensed version of a much more complicated issue called life but the main point is that had Kratom not been easily available to me, I would still be a heroin addict. The fact that it was a simple as ordering online was life-changing. Not everyone can afford to go to the doctor, not everyone wants to (Suboxone/Methadone treatment has insane wait lists and even if you get in, doctors place you on mandatory treatment plan, some lasting as long as 2 years, let alone the financial aspects). The fact that I was able to order Kratom freely was huge in my battle with addiction. No wait lists, no doctors, no meetings, no judgement. \nBy scheduling Kratom, you essentially take away that freedom which will make this LIFE-CHANGING PLANT inaccessible to most people. The benefits of Kratom are just too good to take away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20823","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Shin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \n          My name is Carrie Atkins.

My fianc is a pharmacist and she is entirely on board for keeping Kratom legal because she sees that it doesn't get me high. This all started because of the Vivazen. Vivazen had other supplements on them such as California poppy, kava kava, cats claw, etc. Kratom in its natural form doesn't get you high or anything even close to high. It basically makes you feel normal as for me it levels me out and helps me to accomplish daily routines.  I tried 6 programs over 2 years and time didn't even help because I have issues that Kratom helps alleviate such as severe anxiety, joint and muscle pain, ADHD. Sure I could go to the doctor but the prescriptions they will write me will be those that I have abused because they do make you high. This is life or death for me and I know quite a few other people that feel the same. If Kratom is banned it will be the same as you signing a death certificate for people like me. Kratom saves lives.

I was working as a paramedic at the time and could only take the medication while off duty. It only provided very minor relief, and after a few short weeks, my body had become absolutely dependent on it. I had to suffer withdrawals at work while providing medical treatment to my patients. My work productivity plummeted. I was in an endless cycle of suffering with severe withdrawals and back pain while at work, and being unable to function properly while at home. Taking my prescription while off duty prevented me from driving a car or even mowing the grass because of how it affected my body. I was subsequently let go from my job because of all the sick days I was forced to take and because I was not able to provide adequate care while suffering so many withdrawal symptoms. My life began to fall apart. I come from a family that practices alternative medicine, and it finally occurred to me that there had to be a better solution. I had made several attempts at quitting the hydrocodone in the past but, the withdrawal symptoms were too much to bear, and my marriage began to suffer because of it as well. I also had a history of depression, which at that time had come back and was insurmountable. I discovered Kratom after some research and decided to give it a try. Words cannot describe the relief I experienced from using this plant. My withdrawal symptoms were virtually non-existent, as was my pain, as well as my depression. While on hydrocodone I was very lethargic and could fall asleep standing up&..even at my lowest dose. Kratom provided such greater relief, and did not affect my faculties what so ever. I was able to stop taking my medication and become a functional human being again. I began to take kratom daily&..and after a few months of daily use I decided to stop taking it for two weeks to see how it affected my body. I wanted to see if it produced any withdrawal symptoms like hydrocodone. I was amazed to find that the only symptom I experienced was increased pain from my herniated disk and kyphosis. I DID NOT experience any fatigue, malaise, body ache, diarrhea, insomnia, anxiety, or agitation. It was nothing short of amazing. Fast forward 8 years and I have been utilizing kratom every day since then. I have experienced no ill effects.  It has provided me with the drive and energy to completely change my diet and exercise 5 days a week. It is one of the safest herbal supplements out there and is less harmful, and less addictive than coffee! I now own my own business (herb shop) and I meet people every day who share their story about how kratom changed their lives for the better. Making kratom a schedule 1 drug would have horrible consequences. So many healthy and functional individuals would be forced back on to very addictive and dangerous drugs, legal or otherwise. Overdoses would plague the country because a safe and effective supplement would no longer be available to them, and because of recent drug policy changes, many of them would be forced to resort to street drugs.  It is the job of the DEA and the FDA to protect the American people from harm and this ban would be the exact opposite! America has the highest rates of incarceration in the world and placing a harmless supplement in the schedule 1 category would only make it worse. How can the DEA justify making FELONS out of everyday people who use a harmless supplement that provides so much relief, at a fraction of the cost of prescription drugs, and without a multitude of side effects.  Kratom has also had a huge positive effect on the Indonesian economy, not to mention the American economy.  I opened my herb shop 3 years ago and have been struggling to keep the doors open for the last two. Becoming a kratom vendor has single handedly saved my business. If it is taken away, not only will affect my quality of life from a medical standpoint, it will affect my life financially as well. In my 4 years as a paramedic, not once did I encounter a kratom overdose nor did I meet anyone suffering from kratom withdrawal. This ban would destroy and disrupt thousands of lives, and for what?

I was born with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that mainly impacts my left hand ring finger but begins in the palm of my hand. It causes pain and is even more of a nuisance due to the fact that it is located in one of my hands which are needed for everyday activities. I was on tramadol for 5 years straight and hated it because it made me feel numb and was just a horrible drug overall. Eventually I found kratom and have used it to great success. Small doses make sure there is no persistent pain and there is no elevated feeling that you would get with opiates/opioids. These lies being pushed that kratom is some type of imminent threat to the people of the united states and that it is being abused is nothing more than a lie. It makes me wonder if the people at the DEA really don't know what they are talking about, which makes me wonder why they are in that position in the first place,or if there is some type of ulterior motive here.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with kratom.\nIt is not some threat to the people of the United States.\nIt is not being abused like your typical pain killers that are being pushed by government agencies and big pharma.\nKratom has never killed anyone, ever.\nStop trying to criminalize things that aren't a problem and actually help people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22979","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Although I am new to using Kratom for about six months, I can say without a doubt that I feel much better and can function effectively unlike I did with the effects that prescription medicine caused.

To be frank, the extent of my knowledge about kratom is limited but I do have concerns about a plant being made a schedule 1 controlled substance without very little research.  So why do I even have a dog in this fight?  I personally have dealt with a situation where a safe and effective treatment for a  golf ball sized lymphangioma (LM) in my 4 year old daughters cheek was banned by the FDA.  A treatment called OK-432 has been used around the world for decades to treat LMs successfully, but was not allowed in this country.  The only other option we were presented was surgery, which presented a high likelihood of permanent scarring and muscle paralysis in her face.  As a parent this is a scary decision to make, go to another country for the treatment (possibly multiple times) or risk permanent damage to my little girl's face.  Luckily before we were forced to make that decision, our ENT doctor got us access to a university study that was testing OK-432.  The treatment was a success and our daughter, now 12, has had no ill effects.  There are many families who did not get that lucky.  \n\nThis is why I am speaking out for kratom.  Before we classify this plant schedule 1, lets get more research and information on kratom.  I would hate to think that something that has helped many people for years all of a sudden is taken away as an option without us fully enduring the validity of the argument to make kratom a schedule 1 controlled substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15683","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mike Purcell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing in hopes to keep Keaton legal.

I think it should NOT be declared a controlled substance, and should continue as a health supplement. As you know, there very very few cases of ANY harm regarding to ingestion of Kratom, thus considering just how widespread it's been used and how LITTLE incidents have happened, there are NO reasons for the DEA to classify Kratom as a Schedule 1 Controlled Substance, and the intention should be WITHDRAWN.\nThere are many people who use this plant. Some people who are addicts, try to wean themselves off of opioids by using Kratom, as Kratom can bind to receptor sites but not produce ANY \"high\" or so called euphoria. Enabling the addict to safely wean themselves off of drugs privately. Others are pain patients, but who are no longer being prescribed opioid analgesics, as the DEA has scared doctors SO MUCH , that even pain management specialists are no longer prescribing!! leaving pain patients still in pain and out in the cold. Still other pain patients, dealing with hit and miss circumstances regarding their prescription use Kratom to help them in periods when they are out of their medications, and have to deal with withdrawal. Since the Kratom substances bind to the receptor sites, the pain patient can handle their withdrawal symptoms a little better, with little if any side effects, and no 'euphoria' or 'high'. Kratom is beneficial and has not demonstrated sufficient danger to the public for the DEA to be involved in banning or restricting it or even classifying it. In fact, the DEA should actually consider easing up on opioid pain relievers as they have created such a drastic 'chilling' effect on doctors and pharmacies, that legitimate pain patients are suffering.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16733","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Spencer Alpha","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,my name Kim,im 54,mother of four,grandmother to one .

I'm writing this letter to state my opinion on making kratom a schedule 1 drug.  I learned about kratom several years ago while researching ways to control my pain without the use of prescription drugs. I was born with a progressive spine disease, which causes my spine to deteriorate and migrate. It is currently 63 degrees off from where it should be, and will eventually collapse my lung, or cause nerve damage that will at some point make me unable to walk. I have taken prescription pain medication since the age of 16. My body built a tolerance to them, and the more I took them, the more I needed. I was determined to find something to offer me some relief, and make my life enjoyable again. I was in such cronic pain, that I was no longer able to work, go out with friends and family, or even enjoy my life. When I heard about kratom, I was skeptical. I did a lot of research before finally deciding to try it, I felt I had nothing to lose. After 2 weeks on the supplement, I was no longer a skeptic. It changed my life. I'm totally off all pain medications now, even over the counter ones, I'm back to work, and I'm happy for the first time in decades! I no longer need the antidepressants I was taking either. My life has totally changed thanks to this amazing plant. I've read many articles on the DEA's concerns about kratom, and have never personally experienced any of the side effects they talk about. If kratom was made a scheduled drug, I don't know what I would do. I can't imagine going back to the life I had before. I'm a productive member of society again, and I'm enjoying all aspects of life. Please remember the thousands of people like myself when making your decision on this matter. For myself, this is not a drug, but a miracle herbal supplement that has given me my life back, and given my family me back. I thank you for taking time to read this, and sincerely hope it will make an impact on decision day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3174","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Melanie Russell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom should not be band.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

At the young age of seventeen, my problem with painkillers started. It was a couple every now and again, and it grew into me needing them to even get up out of bed. They helped with my crippling anxiety and depression. Until I ran out, at least. I went cold turkey three or four times, and was miserable. It was so bad, I was bedridden for three days. I battled with that a little over two-and-a-half years. When I started searching for alternatives and \"all natural\" highs, I stumbled across this weird plant the internet called \"kratom\". I started looking into it, but got intimidated by what seemed like dozens of different strains and dropped it. About a week later, I went to my local head shop, told em my story, and they hooked me up. The cashier had the same problem I did, and it turned her world around. I went home, scooped out some powder, washed it down with water and shuddered at the absolutely horrid taste. But what followed, made it all worth it, and then some. Ever since, I haven't felt the need to turn back to painkillers. I've managed to overcome most of my anxiety and I'm now a manager at my work. Kratom doesn't kill. It helps. Please.

My nephew current serves as a fighter pilot.  When I was 38 I came down with idiopathic neuropathy with nerve damage in my feet and hands.  May be related to intensive martial arts training when young.  Anyway ended up by myself - divorced - who wants to hang with a guy who can't stand or walk for more than an few seconds and is in pain all the time.  I got a computer job and never, ever took a day's charity.  Doctor gave me vicodin painkillers, as much as I wanted and the normal dose didn't do much for the pain but messed up my breathing.  Ended up in the hospital and decided to stop the vicodin.  You may think I mixed the pills with booze that is NOT true I used to like to drink a beer or two with friends like most guys, but Doc said would be best to quit so I did many years ago.  Got desperate and was seriously considering using the Smith and Wesson early retirement method which is a disgusting choice in my book but it is true, when I discovered kratom by searching the web for alternatives to painkillers.  It was amazing how much better it helped my pain than the drugs but did not fog the brain or mess up breathing like the junk Doc had.  Nothing against the docs they do the best they can in my book.  Found out DEA is going to ban kratom and just wanted to ask you Please Don't!!!  I would guess there are many patriots there at the DEA and I would like to just ask you to consider that when you are young you feel invincible and cannot imaging ending up like me, but I am here to tell you it happens more often than you think.  And the system is not very interested in what old guys in pain have to say - they would rather you just died or suffered in silence.  There are many people like me who know how to use something like kratom with total responsibility.  I do not know of an alternative at this time that would work, but I will NOT use illegal drugs.  I will respect your decision and will follow your lead as a man who loves his country but sure does not feel that love back sometimes.

I like being able to do work that helps people and along the same vein I support the continued legal, unscheduled status, of kratom because I believe it to help people. My belief is based on both my own experience and the scientific literature that I've seen published on the subject [kratom.]\n\nI first discovered kratom about two years ago because I was looking for something that I could use as a social lubricant instead of alcohol. I enjoy alcohol, as do many, but there is no denying its powerful drug with many undesirable side effects that's ultimately harsh on body. Not that I ever was big drinker(4-6 drinks socially once or twice a week) but I still feel good about reducing my consumption to maybe having a single beer along with my cup of kratom tea.\n\nTo elaborate and be specific about my usage I consume kratom on average once or twice a week in the form of tea that I brew from around 2-3.5 grams of material (crushed or powdered leaf) which is roughly about the size a normal teabag. In social settings I find it helps me open up and overcome any social anxiety that I might be feeling. I also appreciate how its helps me relax, and relieve the tension in my neck and other muscles (maintaining good posture while working at a desk all day can be a job in and of itself, especially if you have pre existing disc issues.) Most of all though what I appreciate about kratom is I get positive, beneficial effects from it without being and feeling intoxicated like I would be from a stronger drug like alcohol (while I enjoy drinking I've never liked being drunk and feeling like I'm less in control.) \n\nAlthough I'm not a chronic pain patient and I don't need or take it [kratom] everyday I empathize with and support anyone that chooses to try using it as an safer alternative to prescription opioids. Worst case, take to much kratom and you'll become nauseous and throw up. Take to many pain pills and you'll stop breathing. Its not my opinion that kratom doesn't cause respiratory depression, its the conclusion of The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association [ December 2016, Vol. 116, 802-809. doi:10.7556/jaoa.2016.156 ]  Importantly, even at very high doses, kratom does not depress respiration. This journal article is available online @ jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524\n\nThe same journal article goes on to elaborate Moreover, recent studies indicate that even though the mitragynines can interact with opioid receptors, their molecular actions are different from those of opioids. In 2 elegant studies, Vradi et al28and Kruegel et al29showed that several mitragynine analogs acted as agonists at  opioid receptors and antagonists at d opioid receptors. Most notably, even though they activated the G-proteinmediated signaling pathway, much like traditional opioids, they did not recruit -arrestin-2, which has been implicated as a mediator of opioid side effects and dependence.30Using a mouse model, Vradi et al28showed that kratom-based drugs had marked analgesic effects but with far fewer side effects, slower development of tolerance, and lower potential for dependence than morphine. Based on all of the evidence, it is clear that kratom and its mitragynine constituents are not opioids and that they should not be classified as such.\n\nI look forward to further congressional, agency, and public discussion about the science of this helpful herbal supplement.\n\nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17886","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to voice my opinion as to the effort by the DEA to move kratom to a schedule 1 drug.  After a work-related accident and numerous back surgeries left me with debilitating pain, I was forced into the nightmare of addiction to prescription pain medications.  I am certain that the doctors meant no harm and, for a while, the medications were effective.  However, over time the effectiveness of the drugs diminished and, like many, I was forced to higher and higher dosages which eventually made my quality of life miserable.  After nearly a decade in that hopeless cycle I found an alternative that allows me to function normally and maintain employment without the harsh effects of prescription pain medications.  That alternative, for me, was kratom.  It has been nothing short of life-saving for me as I am free from the effects of prescription narcotics with a very manageable pain level.  I cant imagine, for the life of me why, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and first hand testimony of a multitude of Americans in support of kratoms safety and efficacy, the DEA is trying to classify this TRADITIONAL TEA LEAF as a Schedule 1 drug.  This ruling would effectively turn myself and many other Americans using this plant into felons overnight costing taxpayers millions while obliterating current federal research on the plant.  Overwhelming evidence, thousands of years of use, and my own experience leads me to believe that kratom is a safe alternative to prescription opiates with important medicinal uses and has changed the lives of so many Americans including myself.  I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic by effectively casting them back into the current opioid and heroin epidemic.  Please keep in mind that, according to published reports, there is absolutely no evidence that kratom poses a danger to personal or public safety when used responsibly.  I fear that this re-scheduling effort will force me back into an addiction and life that will be devastating to myself and my family.  Trust me.  I do not wish that feeling of hopelessness and despair on anyone.  Especially those who suffer from legitimate pain issues and have no other recourse but to resume the addiction nightmare.  I would also be very interested to know how much influence the big drug companies have on this decision.  I am sorry for the length of this comment but I feel that my, and my familys, situation will become desperate.  Again, please reconsider this course of action.  Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19105","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"A Gamble","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has literally turned the life of someone I love around. \nAfter suffering for years with anxiety , and attention deficit disorder she has found something that mildly but effectively put her back in the work force without negative side affects. \n\nThe banning of Kratom will tailspin her back in to the world of prescription medication addiction! \nI'm pleading with all who are involved allwow Kratom to help people like her stay off addictive substances.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoffrey d Gipe","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14136","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Geoffrey Gipe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Both my husband and I have chronic pain conditions that we were prescribed Narcotic opiates for, we took the pain medication for several years. My husband was prescribed 180 norco 10/325 per month due to multiple herniated discs in his back and neck. I was prescribed the same medication for my RA and was prescribed 120 norco 10/325 per month.  The pain was never completely gone and there were all sorts of other residual side effects from taking opiates on a daily basis. I really wanted to just stop taking the medication but everytime I tried the withdrawals and pain was unbearable, so I continued to take the pain medication. Until one day a friend told me about Kratom.  \nI found out where it was sold and decided to give it a try, at least as a way to help me stop relying on opiates so much. I started taking it and within a week I stopped narcotic opiates altogether. It was like a miracle, I didn't get any high or side effects like I did with the prescribed opiates. For the first time in years, I felt like myself again , I felt NORMAL. The Kratom far better relieved my pain! After I had been taking kratom for about a year, my husband decided he wanted to do the same thing and quit the opiates. He quit taking his prescribed Narcotic pain medicine in just a few days and just takes the Kratom for pain management now. I have been taking the Kratom since  2014 and my husband has been taking it since 2015. We have had no issues whatsoever with taking this miracle herbal supplement. \nFurthermore, to say that this plant has NO MEDICAL VALUE OR USE is an absurdity! This plant has the potential to solve the chronic widespread problem of opiate abuse and heroin abuse that has swept across this whole country. It can be used to help combat the severe, dangerous and sometimes deadly effects of withdrawal from powerful opiates. It does not give any kind of high or euphoric feeling that is associated with prescription pain medication and heroin, which can make it less addictive. There is no \"high\" to chase. It simply alleviates chronic pain and makes it easier to stop Narcotic drugs that are killing people on a regular basis. \nThis plant can and has helped thousands of people and can continue to help thousands, maybe millions more if it is allowed to stay legal and to be properly studied, in a long term controlled study. I am sure there are thousands of people who would gladly volunteer for such a study in hopes of proving the effectiveness and helpfulness of this plant. The war on drugs isn't working your way, it's time to find a new way to stop this epidemic and Kratom can be a powerful assistant to combat drug abuse. Please don't take away a plant that had and is doing so much good for so many people and will continue to do so. \n\nThank you for your time,\nKatie Wilson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14110","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katie Wilson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There is no reason for Kratom to be labeled a drug.

I have tried it a couple times and can see why people like it, however the taste is enough to drive me away from it.  \n\nGiven the above statement, I still believe Kratom should not be considered a schedule 1 drug.  Kratom is a drug as much as coffee and caffeine is a drug: however, while caffeine is a stimulant, Kratom is somewhat of the opposite.  It is calming and great on the nerves (almost like nicotine, which I notice is also not a schedule 1 drug).  To compare this drug to cocaine, heroin, or even marijuana (that is a whole other debate) is extraordinarily foolish.  I realize sometimes it comes to who is funding the police force and keeping supporters happy when it comes to drugs like this becoming illicit, but putting Kratom on the schedule 1 list will cause more harm than good:\n\nWhen drugs like marijuana are held in the same regard as heroin or speed, and people try it, they realize it isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  This calls into question how bad harder drugs can be, and gets people to try them, which ruins their lives.  When something that can be compared to coffee or herbal tea is put on the same tier as heroin, this effect will be amplified.  This isn't even accounting for the fact that the punishment for having such a substance as Kratom will be more severe than it's usage, almost to the point where they might as well have tried cocaine for all the good their life will be.  I am sure you realize what can happen to people who have a felony, even if that felony is for something dumb like herbal tea.\n\nIn conclusion, I realize I am not qualified to definitively state whether or not the long term effects are bad, I believe further research into the \"drug\" before rash actions is required, will set a good precedent for the future, and will put citizen's mind more at ease with the way the government is being run these days. \n\nThank you again for taking your time to take input from the citizens.\n\n~A concerned citizen","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4067","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 23 year old male working maintenance on and around pools for a living.

It also allowed me to completely avoid withdrawals as Kratom has many pain relieving properties in itself, properties that DO NOT damage you in anyway, unlike the drugs you are going to put Kratom in the same class as.\n\nKratom save lives, keeps people off drugs, helps people with anxiety and allows them to work and create a life for themselves, Kratom is a good thing, not a bad thing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11522","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Adam Moore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not endorse the the DEA banning Kratom.

I appreciate your time and effort in reading the many responses from people like me who use Kratom regularly to help deal with the many health issues we face.  \nI was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2002.  I have been on every medication used to treat the symptoms of fibro and many off label to try to get relief from this horrible neurological condition that affects the muscles,  ligaments and every other part of my body. From Paxil to presently prescribed opiates, I've not found relief.  They'll make me feel drowsy, but don't help with the pain and exhaustion that I go through everyday.  You may have heard fibromyalgia is very hard to treat. \nAbout two years ago, I was on a Faceook group for fibromyalgia sufferers and someone mentioned Kratom. They said it was a plant from the coffee family and was not dangerous like opiates are. As you're well aware, opiate use and abuse is at an all time high across our great nation.  Heroin and prescription pills are killing people everyday. I've personally lost two family members to opiate abuse. I did not want to become a statistic or memory to my daughter. \nI am one who has always been proactive in my healthcare.  I researched Kratom for months before I finally found the American Kratom Association website.  The group helped me find a Facebook group and there is found A vendor who has a safe and tested product. My first time using Kratom still causes me to tears up.  For the first time since I was a teenager, I felt like that strong man with his hands clawing into my upper back and shoulders had released me!  There was no high, no woogly feeling, no spaciness, just a relaxation that came over my body. I cry email etude time I think of it because I finally found something to help give me a break from the horrible pain I've felt, most of my life!  \nI learned about the different strains of Kratom, and found there was also one that helped people lie me get energy. I tried it along with the first and I could clean my house!  All my daughter's life, I spent on the couch, curled up in pain. My pain costed her a childhood she could have had, had I known about Kratom.  As much as I tried to work 45+ hours a week, and be a good mother, I was just too exhausted to do much of anything else when I picked her up from daycare.  \nKratom has given me life! Literally life!  My now 24 year old daughter and I can go shopping, and spend the day! Yes. I am exhausted and achy the next few days, but at least I can do it!   \nPlease take the comments of people who use this natural botanical in to consideration before you take it away. With the dangers we all face with opiates, this plant could be a saving grace for the millions dealing with pain and opiate abuse. \nThank you for your time. \n Sincerely, Peggy Hall","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14231","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peggy Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a 29 year old Store Manager for a local independent business. I am writing to tell my story to explain why I oppose kratom being put on the schedule 1 list of controlled substances by the DEA. Here is my thoughts on why kratom should remain off the list of scheduled substances. I found out about kratom 4 years ago. I have depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. I had, 4 years ago, also a severe eating disorder. But and happy to say that now I am healthy. I am proud to say that I have a successful career, a beautiful home, and a family. These are things I thought I'd never be able to do/have while I suffered so much with my problems. I think somehow, Kratom tea might be a small part of what has helped me manage my depression and recover from my eating disorder. Its been a multi-faceted journey but I do believe the tea has contributed. From my diet, exercise, and work I have learned how to balance my life day to day to improve it to take me to where I am now. I no longer suffer from any eating disorders, and although my depression is not gone, it is now manageable. Around 6 years ago I saw my cousin - who also suffered and struggled with depression - eventually go to the doctor to see if they could help him. I saw him fade away when his doctors prescribed him supposedly \"safe\" medications for his depression and back pain. When he started taking these intoxicating medications, my family and I witnessed him changing for the worse until when, 4 and a half years ago, he overdosed and died from prescription pain pills. Due to becoming addicted to the medications he was prescribed, he lost his career, his house, and his family. I saw this charismatic and formerly successful man waste away physically and mentally from the disease of addiction to prescription pills. Clearly these medications are dangerous. But kratom tea isn't anything like those prescription medications. It's not intoxicating or addictive, and I have never experienced any ill effects that have been rumored to occur with Kratom. It's just a tea. Yet the DEA seems to think the tea leaf is so dangerous that it needs to be controlled, scheduled, and/or even banned. Why not focus on actual drugs that claim people's life year to year? So many Americans go down the same path as my cousin did. Situations like those is where the real problem lies in America's drug epidemic. Kratom is not a drug and is certainly not something that you could overdose on or \"get high\" with like people do with drugs. The problem doesn't lie with the natural tea leaf kratom. I just don't understand why anyone would want to ban or schedule a tea leaf that is harmless and might help people in a safe way. Much like coffee, or chamomile tea, or St Johns Wort might help people. It is certainly equally as harmless as those things. It isn't comparable in any way to the drugs found on the DEA's list of controlled substances. So it shouldn't be put on that list. In conclusion, I believe kratom should remain off the schedule 1 list of controlled substances. I believe it shouldn't be scheduled at all. Because Kratom is not harmful and it is not something you could \"overdose\" on. It is not even close to being dangerous like the prescription medications my cousin was prescribed and eventually took his own life with. How could anyone say it is more or just as dangerous as that? It has been taken safely for decades and is just as harmless as coffee. That has been proven to me time and time again throughout 4 years. I can attest that my life has improved throughout those years and it has taken a lot of work. Depression is a blanket that is difficult to get out from under. But Kratom tea has, I think, helped in a way for me to be healthier and more mindful to keep balance in my life. So please don't take that away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22903","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have watched videos of people with serious tics that have subsided while taking Kratom, some of the medications given can make you nauseous or cause other side affects but Kratom actually helps with nausea while helping with other problems.

I was struggling with a lot of pain from fibromyalgia, ehlers-danlos syndrome, and neuropathy.  I am also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and after learning reversing it is possible, I made that my goal. I was facing the choice of trying to continue to work, or to try to battle for disability. I was about to lose my job due to attendance issues due to pain and other effects of my disorders. When I was able to work, my performance was suffering. I was becoming depressed. I wanted to go to sleep and not wake up anymore faced with the thought of living the rest of my life like this. I decided to seek help by joining some support groups on facebook. I have children and it wouldn't be fair for them to lose their mother if my frame of mind didn't improve. I started seeing people mention kratom, among other herbs, and did some research, and asked a lot of questions, and listened to a lot of personal testimony. I decided that it was worth a try, as what I was currently doing wasn't working at all, and I was slipping farther and farther down a spiral I didn't want to be on. \n\nNow let's fast forward two years. I am back to working full time, and back to working with my old work performance. I have my own insurance again through work. I have been able to be more active and was able to make a huge step in my goal to reverse diabetes, and have not needed medication for it for ten months now. I have lost weight, am more active, and overall a healthier person now. It wasn't all kratom alone, but it was a tool on my road to recovery, and even though I will always have these disorders, I can now function with them and remain a productive member of society. My doctor fully supports me and has been amazed at the transformation. My children have their mother back, and I am again enjoying my life. \n\nPlease do not take this tool away from me, and so many thousands of others who have found this tool to aid us in living a life instead of being locked in a prison. It has caused zero deaths over hundreds of years of use. You cannot overdose and die. It does not cause respiratory depression. It simply helps us tolerate the hand we were dealt in a life of chronic pain. We are adults and should be able to make this choice of what we put in our bodies to help us lead productive lives, because that is all we all want. I don't think that is too much to ask, to be happy, and healthy, and alive.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amanda Lewis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm not a personal Kratom user.

I started researching alternative non narcotic non addicting natural treatments and came across articles about others that had tried kratom. I ordered some in powder form and capped it in gel caps, I immediately felt relief bringing my average pain level from a 5 to 6 down to a 2 and had my energy back but was still able to sleep so much better than I had in years. I do still have a severe enough flare up to require narcotics about once every three or four months for a day or two but that is welcome over being a daily user addicted and suffering from side affects. I'm the three years I have been taking kratom ( 12-16 powder filled capsules a day) I have never had to increase my dose, never suffer any side affects and no withdrawal symptoms if I go a few days without!

Substance abuse and addiction has also been a major part of my life over the past five years (I am 21 years old) but kratom has actually given me the simple ABILITY to wean and even outright cessate from the drugs that once threatened my young life, many of which are actually totally LEGAL bit FAR more dangerous than kratom objectively speaking. On top of it's Godsend like abilities helping my addiction issues, it once quelled my unmedicated mental illness's symptoms enough to make life livable for me until I could find a prescriber. Presently, kratom is an effective adjunct to the low dose psychiatric prescription medicine (an ndri if that is necessary to know) that I take on a daily basis. Because of kratom, I have managed to avoid consuming any alcohol since I've started using kratom. Even when I turned 21, I did not drink and still don't 6 months later.

To be honest, I have never even personally tried it. My concern is that the Pharmaceutical companies are pushing for this so that they can have their own patent on Kratom and/or to keep their prescription drugs still highly sought after. \n\nI personally have been effected by a loved one being addicted to prescription drugs. The drugs were first given to my loved one to help manage the pain he was experiencing due to a degenerate disc issue with his back. With no real cure for his back, the pain meds kept getting prescribed to keep him comfortable & mobile. His addiction has ripped our family apart. \n\nI myself had a full knee replacement at a young age from a freak accident. The same pain killers were pushed on me. I took them when I felt necessary, but I could see how highly addictive they are.  I also, didn't like myself much while I was on them. I actually had one of my Doctors lecturing me at a check-up appointment because I wasn't taking them as prescribed. He was a appalled that I still had my original prescription and did not need a refill. His response was that \"I was slowing down my recovery time by not taking them\". However, on the contrary, my physical therapist stated \"that she never saw someone make such vast improvements so quickly after surgery\". \n\nThe point to my rant is, that something that is natural and seems to be helping many people should not be banned. If anything, there needs to be extensive research done before Kratom gets categorized as a Schedule 1 drug. More holistic approaches should be taken when treating our medical conditions. If I thought for one second that Kratom was life threatening or addictive, then my letter here would be written very differently. I am a social worker that works with at risk teens, and I see daily young kids abusing drugs. The most common one being prescription pain killers.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16219","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have had chronic back pain for a long time & kratom is the only thing that gets rid of my pain","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15232","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n    Kratom has saved my life in a sense!

Every year children are born to addicted parents and ive seen the worst affects of this drug and they are a far better alternative to heroin or other opiates , from all the info ive seen it looks like nobody knows enough about this drug , why do we ban things  we dont understand , we need trials .","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12452","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Byrne","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Keaton legal.

A friend who has experience with the plant for many years first introduced me to Kratom. Originally, I would drink a bit after a night of drinking to curb the hangover and feel like a normal productive human again, but overtime I have found that Kratom is an excellent supplement in other arenas.\nI have ovarian cysts, which manifest into painful, debilitating periods. For years I would have to take a day off work or school because of the pain. Kratom is a lifesaver in mitigating the pain, and allows me to resume life as usual.  I no longer miss class, or a productive day of work due to period pains. I have about 4 grams of red-strain Kratom at the onset of pain, and in a few minutes it goes from debilitating pain to discrete and manageable. \n\nAs a professional and student my days are incredibly long, and tiresome. After a full days work, I need to change gears and study. Kratom is an incredible study supplement and helps me re-focus my brain, and utilize my time productively. Its subtle stimulating effects help keep me awake, without the negative side effects of taking a stimulant drug. \nLastly, and most importantly, I no longer drink alcohol the way I used to prior to Kratom. Instead of having a beer at night, I just take bit of Kratom to wind down. It was not purposeful; I just enjoy the way Kratom makes me feel (productive and relaxed) over alcohol (reckless and bloated). The effects have been amazing. I lost weight as a result of not drinking alcohol (I was 20lbs overweight last year), I spend less money (Kratom is significantly cheaper), and my days just feel more full and productive. \n\nThat being said, I, along with this entire community would feel robbed if Kratom is no longer available. As an American, I am proud of the freedom granted to us, and the ability to form communities such as this one. I believe the DEAs responsibility of reducing the availability of illicit substances is important, but not relevant, nor warranted in the case of Kratom. Further regulations are not only monetarily costly, but costly to the reputation and efficacy of the DEA. As an American citizen I expect the DEA to control substances that actually cause harm, not vice versa. If the DEA continues with scheduling Kratom than the organization risks losing its credibility and trust with this community, and greater American community.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12717","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA,\nI would like to submit that I strongly believe you should not place Kratom on Schedule 1.

Upon the retirement of my primary care physician about 5+ years ago, I believed I suffered only from traditional ailments - lose some weight, exercise more, eat healthier. About a year ago, I lost my wife which started a vicious downward spiral of depression, bad diet decisions (microwave laziness at its worst), no-hope lethargy, loss of my home, loss of the car. I had learned to live with the sciatica. I had learned to live with the kidney stones. I had learned to live with the occasional migraine. But the chest pains keeping me up at night led me to medical council. They did heart surgery a few days later advising me I had hyperglycemia hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well as a new stent. Though the surgical pain was minor for a few weeks, it triggered some very deep traumas that left me without pain medications (surgeon lacked the triple form pad to write it, and I had no primary care physician) or emotional support. I was advised very clearly if that pain is too intense to visit the Emergency Room. So I did, laying there weeping in pain, being treated like a drug addict though I had NEVER taken drugs before. The attending physician titled it 'post traumatic stress disorder' and the hospital was able to fast-track me into a primary care physician who successfully treated the symptoms. I sought council for the PTSD and was directed to half a dozen different medications during the process. NONE of the scribed medications were suitable, some inducing nearly immediate severe suicidal thoughts and generating a cloud of haze that made normal function practically impossible. Despite multiple ween-off-that-one-and-try-this-one medications I was still dwelling on negative thoughts which quite honestly were getting darker by the week. --> the combination of the constant pain with the constant depression fed on each other <-- In an act contrary to my nature and born out of true desperation where suicide was a viable thought, I broke every convention of my conservative upbringing and sought out any vein of pain relief. I was directed to a herbal referred to as Kratom described to have mild opiate like effects on the pain receptors. I acquired a small supply suitable for a couple of weeks at lowest dose available (unrefined, not extracted, referred to as 1X). My goal was to bring the pain down to manageable so that I could rest fully and give the depression less foothold. My intentions were to add one dose nightly to the dozen medications and shots I am now scripted to take several times a day. The impact of this addition was clear. While the pain management was nominal, the effect on my depression was profound. In my continuing council with the PTSD the dark thoughts were no longer dwelling, suicidal thoughts no longer intruding in my every action, I was able to resume my highly technical role without cloud or haze. I am certain without this resource I would not be a productive member of society and if things had continued much further, I would most likely have been an empty suicide statistic. Thank you for taking time to review this. p.s. my hope for my future has been restored, while I had felt helpless to prevent entropy from consuming my world around me, I am again proactive and preventive.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4294","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"See attached","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23204","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"m.2106-2108"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam,\nMy kratom story as succinctly as possible. I am a 41 year old disabled woman. Prior to my diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis in 2003, probable misdiagnosis explained soon, I was a Case Manager a.k.a. Social Worker at WI Correctional Forensics Dept. I worked 100% with adults that were dually diagnosed as \"severely mentally ill with co-occuring substance abuse addictions\". My job was to assist offenders once they were released from confinement (jail, prison, psychiatric institutions) with their needs to prevent re-institutionalization.  This included finding housing, controlling their Medicaid funds, shopping, Dr. appt's, court appt's, writing Case Management reports every 6 months to address any and all activities of daily living and discussing this with each client to gain their input and changes/agreement. I worked daily in conjunction with a staff including a pharmacist, nurse, psychiatrist and more education psychiatric social workers. \nI did this until I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and required a wheelchair/became confined to my bed for most of 18 months. Despite doing as I was advised by my Neurologist, I very quickly declined. My medication list was 2.5 pages long of prescription medications that did not seem to help but all did have their own side effects. I lived that way for about 8 years, continuing to do teleconferences, online research looking for new treatments that might help. Then in 2011 I was accepted into a Clinical Trial for a Vascular Condition. Testing via MRV & MRA's exhibited that my jugular veins were very stenosed by over 80% each. That was 5.5 years ago. I've been off of ALL Rxs since 3/11, no exacerbations. In that time and currently, my focus is rebuilding my life, trying to heal myself naturally. Pain entered my life years ago from falls and over prescription of IV steroids to calm my 'MS' exacerbations. So I did an online search for natural pain relievers. I've discovered and use kratom, ginger, clove, chamomile, valerian, kava, red pepper, etc. I prefer what can be used in it's natural state or as close to that as possible. \nWhile I currently have Rxs for substances such as Oxycodone, and Xanax and they have their place in our lives, I prefer a slower, kinder, gentler attempt before using things with addiction potentials and overdose possibilities. For example, I just had wisdom teeth extracted. Percocet was very valuable! The Xanax as well, I hate needles, lol. Once the pain was more tolerable, 600-800mg of Ibuprofen with 1/8th of a teaspoon of kratom allowed me to stop the Rxs that could cause my death.\nBesides having worked with addicts in the prison system and seeing the harm that can be done, I'm at increased risk of death. After 18 months of bed dependance, my lungs are very weak and thus, Percocet and Xanax cause great fear within me.\nObviously, I'm very careful of substances, both 'natural, and pharmaceutical. \nI'm a well read college educated individual that suffers from medical conditions that medicine has been unable to help in any substantial manner. So I sought help from nature. It is my belief that I am the best judge of what can help me.\nI recognize this is just a job for the DEA but scheduling this plant will effectively create more criminals when I thought society was tired of incarceration as a 'treatment'.\n I guess the DOJ can begin building prisons that all fully handicapped accessible? \nI'd like to think this was a big mistake on your end. Maybe you thought this was a synthetic substance s you didn't overstep the powers you were granted? I'd like to believe that very much!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20802","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donna C","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an old lady with chronic pain issues. I have scoliosis, spinal stenosis, DDD, three messed up discs in my lower lumbar, nerve damage, and arthritis growing in me like kudzu-and the MRIs to prove it. I have used various vitamins, minerals, herbs, and supplements for over a decade to tend to and nourish my body. I began supplementing with kratom about a year and a half ago to help with my pain issues. Before, I couldn't take care of my home, my family, my responsibilities or me very well because of the pain, and being unable to stand for very long. I can now. I have my life back. And no one has the right to tell me to give it up. I don't owe anyonethat. Whenever the government wants my tax money, or my time for my civic duties, I'm treated like the responsible adult that I am-but when I want to tend MY health, MY body, I'm treated like an errant child?\nThemisinformation (propaganda?) that keeps getting repeated has been disproved, logically, scientifically.Kratom has never caused death by itself, and it does not suppress respiration like an opiate-it doesn't have that mechanism! Science, not supposition and innuendo, is the correct way to do things. As for the strange rumor that it was a scourge in this country so it needed to be immediately banned-many people had never even heard of it! Hmm. \nNot just for myself, but for so many others that have been helped by this plant, YES I oppose banning kratom, this is just ridiculous!\nWe have many Veterans who, after honorably serving their country, and coming back horribly damaged, have been miserably failed by the V.A. And some of them have found that supplementing with kratom helps them get some relief, so they can have some kind of quality of life instead of merely existing. You would take that away? Really? Our Vets have been kicked around enough by a nation that has treated them disgracefully, instead of honoring the debt we owe them, a debt we can never really repay.\nAs a tax payer, I'm wondering-when folks that were able to work, and support themselves, their families, have this taken away and end up on disability (and eventually they will qualify) who's going to pay for that? If some herbal tea lets them remain productive tax payers-let them! And they deserve to be able to take care of their families and themselves.\nThe DEA sure doesn't seem to be pursuing a way to stop the explosion of deadly heroin in our communities as much as they're pursuing a plant that never killed anyone.Kratommight actually help the situation, stop people from literally dropping dead in the streets-and you want to ban it? Is this the government's way of deliberately killing these people by denying access to a natural plant that could prevent it? Hmm, that sounds strangely familiar.\nMy Bible says God put everything that grows upon this earth for us. As a Christian I am deeply offended, and repulsed, that some mere mortals in my government are arrogant enough to put themselves above God to try to deny me (and many others)our God-given basic human right to tend ourown bodies. Using natural things that God has provided is my religious right. \nSo YES I oppose this ban on Kratom-it is unfounded, unscientific, andillogical. Anyone with half a brain can see that it's a bunch of nonsense based on lies by people who have not bothered to educate themselves. Or have another agenda that is yet to be revealed. And I'm so glad that so many are watching and have seen this too. The fact that some people speaking up against the ban now are medical professionals just further proves the truth we knew all along-kratom CAN help save lives, it already has. Why in the world would any decent human being have a problem with that?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22751","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sabrina Gifford","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps me with my pain, inflammation and anxiety.

I am an Associate Manager for the supplements department in Whole Foods. \n\nI have been using kratom for about 2 years now. Originally I started using this when I torn my meniscus from a bike accident. I was prescribed Hydrocodone for the pain, because I could not walk. Knowing that I was going to be on it for a about 3 months I was not too keen on using opiates due to the almost inevitable physical dependence potential. After doing some research and decided to give kratom a try. To my surprise, Kratom gave me about 5-8 hours of pain relief, while the hydrocodone only gave me about 3 hours of pain relief. So I went with kratom and used that for about 3 months. When I was done, I just stopped. I did not experience any withdrawal symptoms or any cravings. I went on with my life without skipping a beat, and actually forgot about it for a little while. Later on I found some strains that were beneficial for the mood, anxiety, and fatigue issues I was having. It helps keep me on point at work, it completely got rid of fatigue, and helped me with my anxiety/mood issues. Over the years I have also found it tremendously helpful for relieving post insomnia brain fog, and reducing cold/flu symptoms. \n\nTo this day I use it regularly and it has dramatically improved my quality of life. When I take a break I never noticed any withdrawal symptoms other than a little bit of irritability and tiredness. Its no different than abstaining from caffeine.\n\nOverall kratom has been a blessing to me and my life. I have nothing but positive things to say about it. Some strains suit my body chemistry better than others but this plant is not dangerous. I am sure it is possible that in some circumstances when it is combined with other substances, like powerful prescription drugs, there may be interactions, but that could happen with anything that is on the market. This plant helps people from all walks of life. There are many people relying on this plant to help them manage painful chronic conditions. Making this plant illegal would be a crime against humanity and highly unethical.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15225","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matt Ferraiolo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please avoid criminalizing this medicinal plant.

Instead, I will relay purely anecdotal first-hand experiences I have had with Mitragyna Speciosa, commonly known as the Kratom plant. \nI discovered Kratom while looking for herbal and alternative treatments for anxiety and depression. I had tried the common pharmaceutical treatments and had found them to be, at best, ineffective, if not outright exacerbating to the issue. I tried it, on and off, for sometime and found it to be effective in treating my psychological maladies. I would start to use it regularly when I was diagnosed with Lyme's Disease, and unfortunately it seems to be a chronic case. In alleviating my muscle-pain and headaches I found nothing that could compare to how Kratom effectively managed the debilitating symptoms. To be perfectly honest, I felt as though I were human again. That I could now live my life to a degree previously thought unobtainable. I am not naive, however, I have witnessed what drug addiction can do and with this in mind I decided to test what the effects of going from every day usage for a month to no usage would potentially be. For five days I used no Kratom products and felt little to no negative effects outside of the maladies that plagued me before I began to use it in the first place. Satisfied; I resumed my normal consumption. \nI do not believe it hyperbole to state that most, if not all the credit for how productive and capable I am today is thanks to the aforementioned South-East Asian plant. \nI fear this plant being taken away from me, that I will be resigned to continue suffering in the way that I had become accustomed to with both my psychological and physiological ailments. Without Kratom, I would have no other choice but to put myself through the pharmaceutical gauntlet of possible treatments. I would no doubt find myself taking a cocktail of drugs that would include opioid pain medication and/or muscle relaxers for the Lyme's and anxiety medication for the titular issue. I am young, and I do not wish to see myself join the growing percentage of young adults currently facing addiction to painkillers and other prescription medications. \nIn fact, Kratom has well-publicized uses when combating the above stated social ill. It is more mild than Methadone or Suboxone and also has shown promise in treating alcoholism. If not the plant itself, than chemical alterations tailored for these purposes surely show promise. If this plant holds the key to future analgesic and psychological medications that are less habit forming, and much milder in nature, whereas current treatments are harsh, and come with side-effects the likes of which I have never encountered with Kratom, than it should be this agency's job to safe guard this, to make it available to where it can do the most good, not restrict it in a misguided, and counter-productive sweeping action that will no doubt lead to so much suffering and unnecessary  death, perhaps even my own. \nI do not believe in panacea, Kratom will not single-handedly solve the addiction epidemic gripping not only my home state, but the entire country at large. It will not cure cancer, but if it can ease the passing of someone afflicted with it, without them being in a stupor, if it can effectively treat my two debilitating illnesses with none of the side-effects I could expect from typical treatments, if it can help someone come off of heroin or prescription painkillers, and keep them off, then I ask humbly is it not a step in the right direction? For me, and many like me, it is the only direction. The only one that leads to a life worth living without pain, and suffering on a daily basis. Without side-effects, comparable in debilitation to the illness being treated in the first place. Without the anxiety of 'prescription day'. And so it is worth fighting for. I beseech you humbly, please do not resign us to the other fate.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11484","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon Parolisi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop the ban on Kratom.

I would like to ask him why is states right on the package that it is not for human or animal consumption. When I contacted them I was told it was a cleaning agent. He knows what he is selling and who he is selling it to and its not for medical reasons. It is drug addicts. He is no different than a dealer on the street.

However last year I consumed a parasite in Hawaii called Angiostrongylus Cantonensis that is fatal in some cases. The parasite does neurological nerve damage before dying off. In my case I was bedridden for 3 months and have experienced continual nerve pain and a constant neurological malaise for 18 months now.  I was prescribed hydrocodone by my family physician and Tramadol by my neurologist.  Though those medicines helped me to feel better I was concerned about their side effects. Six months ago I discovered Kratom and it has made a great difference in my day to day quality of life. I was immediately able to stop using the chemical medicines and have experienced not one ill effect from the Kratom and I am grateful to say that I almost feel my normal self unless I discontinue the Kratom for a few days in which case the nerve pain and malaise return. I have a few friends who were also stricken with the parasite who are still using methadone 10 and 12 years later for the nerve pain. I have recommended Kratom to them as it seems to help people get off of opioids. It seems disingenuous to ban a natural plant medicine that makes such a difference in so many people's lives especially as we experience this nationwide opioid epidemic. I have found this year how important is our quality of life and well being. Until one loses that it's difficult to understand so much suffering experienced by so many that can be alievated by plant medicines like Kratom. I have found no down side in my use of Kratom. I am easily able to keep my dosage as minimal as possible (3-5 grams per day. I do understand that like any substance Kratom can be abused and should be regulated. Yet if it were banned it would bring forth so much needless suffering to so many physically challenged people myself included. The compounds in Kratom rather need to be studied and applied appropriately for the benefit of humankind. Thank you for your consideration and may you experience perfect health and well being.

Other pain relievers are not effective, or too debilitating. Kratom does not impair me, but takes care of my pain. I have taken it for several years, it is a godsend. I take 2 tablespoons per day, one in the morning, one in the evening, as tea. I couldn't sleep before Kratom, I took numerous days off, and playing with my son was painful (but you do it anyway). For the past 2 years Kratom has been a new lease on life. \n\nWhich leads to my next point, Kratom has no value as a recreational drug. People I know take it for pain, anxiety, and depression. I have read that it helps with opioid withdrawals. Kratom can put you in a good mood, but you can't take more to feel \"even better\" or get intoxicated. It has a small effect on mood, and that is it.Taking more will make only you sick (like a lot of things, e.g. eating an entire cake).\n\nMy last point is that Kratom is harmless, and has been widely used for hundreds of years (if not thousands of years). It has been unregulated, and we in the Kratom community want it to stay that way. We could not believe it when the DEA announced that our therapeutic tea is suddenly a dangerous street drug. That using it could land us in prison. It could have been a joke, but putting good people in jail is far from from it.\n\nPlease leave Kratom as it is, unregulated. More people call poison control about almost everything. Laundry pods, kids glue, OTC medicines, household cleaners, energy drinks, jolt cola, the list is literally endless.\n\nAnd if someone mixes heroin, cocaine and aspirin and then dies - don't blame the aspirin.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22832","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Jacobs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a young women with many medical issues.

I have been an active man in excellent health all of my life until I turned 62. Seemingly, out of nowhere I was struck with debilitating pain, stiffness, fatigue and exhaustion. I could hardly get off the bed for longer than a few hours a day. Doctors attributed parts of the cause to arthritis and other parts to chronic pain syndrome .\nNo amount of over the counter drugs would alleviate my pain in the slightest. Reluctantly, I took prescribed Vicodin for a while. As my dosage increased to catch up with its declining effects, in my anger and desperation, I threw the pills away. I did not want to be high and or hooked on opiates. As a result, I was literally bedridden and in agony for months while contemplating end of life options. \nOne day a friend who was familiar with my plight brought me a bottle of kratom. I felt my normal self right after one dosage.  IT SAVED MY LIFE. That was two years ago. I have been taking my three grams of kratom a day and have been working out at local gym six days a week ever since. Now, at age 65, I am a healthy senior citizen who is not a burden on Medicare . Thanks to kratom for effective pain relief and zero side effects. To equate kratom to heroin, or narcotics is, in my view, preposterous.\nThere is nothing in existence that cannot be abused by ignorant or stupid persons. Leaving tens of thousands of our citizens to suffer in excruciating pain, because according to your findings 24 people who also had other drugs or illegal substances in their systems have died over a period of two years, does not establish a rationale for banning kratom. \nPlease, be the champions of good public service. Leave Kratom alone.

No one has died from kratom alone and if 1 person has in its 1000 years of existence then that would prove how safe it is because people have died from nearly everything in the world. More people have died from water. Ban Water. More people have died from peanuts. Ban Peanuts. More people have died from milk. Ban Milk, When people think of water, milk and peanuts they do not think of danger and they shouldnt because when you factor in odds they are all safe. Kratom is a tool for some and it has been used by many to combat pain and anxiety. You would essentially be banning people to live  because kratom has saved countless lives. Heroin and pain pill abuse will spiral out of control if kratom is banned. Kratom does also not cause the side effects that are listed by the DEA. The inherent danger with opiates is respiratory depression. Studies have shown kratom does NOT cause respiratory depression. It has also been said by many academics and universities that it could be used to help with opioid addiction. DEA also states that they are considering scheduling because it is an imminent danger to public health. The only danger to public health would be if you banned kratom because people would go back to pain pills for relief and I dont think the DEA/FDA wants to go down the road of how many deaths have been caused by opiates because if the DEA does decide to go forward with a ban just know that opiates are likely to kill 80 people on the day before the ban. Numbers are only going to go up with opiate related deaths if kratom is banned.\n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Giles","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The idea of making Kratom a Schedule I substance is equivalent to making coffee a Schedule I substance.  Besides the fact that they are in the same plant family, the level of psychoactive effects they possess are also equivalent.  To say that kratom should be classified as an opiate is utterly absurd. Obviously I can't make any claims that kratom is a medicine that can be used to cure any diseases, but I think it's safe to say that it harmlessly promotes a certain sense of well being, energy, focus, and clarity much in the same way that coffee does.  However there should absolutely be some regulations for quality control.  Any kratom user should be assured that they are getting pure, unadulterated kratom leaf when they purchase it.  \n\nI am a 41 year old man with a family, and a professional career.  I have never been a recreational drug user.  I don't enjoy any substance (including alcohol) that potentially takes me out of my \"right mind\".  About seven years ago, I sustained a back injury that necessitated the use of oxycodone.  I can't even begin to express how the awful side effects of that drug debilitated me.  I couldn't think straight, I was constipated, depressed, and anxious all the time during that period.  Since my back pain became chronic, I slowly noticed myself becoming dependent on these awful pills, despite the horrible side effects I was experiencing.  It was then that a friend recommended that I try kratom. During that time, I used kratom and it provided me with the well-being I needed in order to cease taking those terrible pills.  It didn't alter my consciousness in any noticeable way, but I felt that it rid me of the desire to continue taking oxycodone.  I was able to get back to my normal functioning at my job, and as a father with no ill side effects.  When my back was healed, I ceased taking kratom with no withdrawal symptoms (very unlike what the pills did to me).\n\nOccasionally my back pain recurs, and I can't even begin to describe how fearful I am of taking any opiate painkillers.  Those drugs debilitate my normal functioning, while kratom, if anything, enhances it.  I realize I can't make any actual claims that kratom is a \"cure\" for anything, but for me personally it certainly helps the pain as well as my mood.  I've witnessed other people who were hopelessly addicted to pain killers, and kratom completely helped seamlessly turn their life around, with little to no side effects.  \n\nBanning kratom is an absurd idea, given the opiate epidemic that our country is suffering from.  I can't possibly comprehend why the DEA would go to such great lengths to point out the few deaths associated with kratom (which were all actually attributable to other drugs, if you you read up), when thousands and thousands of people are dying each year from prescription painkillers.  Making it a Schedule I drug would hinder any research that can be done.  Being that alcohol, coffee, and tobacco are legal substances in this country, I can only surmise that there is some underlying financial reason that the FDA is demonizing kratom for the benefit of the pharmaceutical companies.  If you're strictly looking at statistics, kratom is far safer than mostly any substance available to the public (including tobacco, alcohol, Tylenol, painkillers, etc.) \n\nLast I checked, this is supposed to be a free country.  I am a fully functioning member of society who is raising a family. Please don't take away an herb that benefits so many people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21478","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Craig Bergen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Changed my life for the better forever i use twice a week and dont go over helps with my anxiety and pts i love it and hope it isnt taken away.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7606","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josh King","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please leave Kratom on the market.

Upon hearing of the DEA's intent to schedule Kratom alongside Heroin, I was shocked. I have used Kratom frequently over the last three years as an extremely effective aid to deal with the pain that results from spinal degeneration. While prescription painkillers have been made available to me, I have seen and heard of too many instances of dependence and addiction to want to consistently use them. It is for this reason that I sought out a safer and more natural alternative and ultimately stumbled upon Kratom. And you know what? Kratom serves my pain needs perfectly and without any of the mental clouding or \"zombie\"-like effect that painkillers offer. I am still a functioning, productive member of society with no addictive cravings whatsoever (well, except for coffee, that is!). It saddens me to know that according to the proposed law, I would be seen by the legal system as no different than a Heroin user.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that the DEA's and FDA's attempt to ban Kratom is due to these agencies' well-meaning, but misdirected, attempt to address the nation's opioid problem in the face of a dearth of laws applicable to dealing with unique situations like the one presented by Kratom. As far as painkillers go, America's \"medicine chest\" is pretty binary: there is the shelf of acetaminophen, aspirin, and the NSAIDS (the \"Weak Ones\") and then there is the shelf of the highly addictive narcotics (the \"Strong Ones\"). There is surprisingly very little in between. With its (1) well-established safety profile, prove-able both by its long history of use and cultivation and emerging studies revealing the very-real pharmacological bases for this observed safety, and (2) significant analgesic effects, Kratom is unique positioned in between the Weak and Strong ones, leaving the government confused as to how to deal with it. It really is an amazingly unique plant, and to see the reliance on 15 questionable deaths and 600 calls to poison-control centers as the basis for establishing an \"imminent public threat\" while this country is in the midst of a prescription painkiller epidemic, is very saddening. A plant that provides analgesia nearly as good as prescription painkillers but without exhibiting respiratory depression or a significant addiction potential? Kratom is not a problem, but a potential *solution*!\n\nRather than try to fit a square peg into a round hole, I implore the DEA and FDA to regulate Kratom as it would any other dietary supplement, but with an added age restriction. Doing so would (i) allow for further research, (ii) ensure the public has access to unadulterated product, and (ii) keep it in the hands of adults. I would imagine even the most zealous anti-drug advocate can see the sense in this approach. After all, apart from the immense benefit it provides to pain sufferers like me, the overwhelming anecdotal evidence of Kratom's ability to allow opioid addicts to \"step down\" via Kratom to a life without addiction (or at worst, a life managed with Kratom) is itself something to be further explored and should give all of us great hope that the United States may be able to finally heal itself of this terrible affliction.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to provide my comment, and on behalf of the millions of pain sufferers and others who find their lives profoundly improved by this incredible little plant, I hope and pray you will do the right thing. I only wish I didn't have to post anonymously, but the actions of the DEA scare me. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2013","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I first off want to say I am a responsible user of this great herb called kratom and got a story to tell. I use to be addicted to opiates 5 years go and my addiction was so bad I didnt care what it did to my health as long as I had my high. Thats really a dangerous lifeatyle to lead, just to think I only got into pills due to a prescription in the first place from a constant tooth problem since highschool. \nMy first time hearing about kratom, At the time I did not know what it is but kept hearing it was a natural remedy that is similiar to vicodin, So I end up buying some thinking this would be a cheaper way to get high. \nThe experience first time trying it, a miracle! It made me relaxed, think more clearly, energized, not feel so fatigued and made me question the way I was living my life. It like made me look in the mirror for the first time and see for myself I need to stop hurting myself. \nSo I stopped the pills cold turkey after that, and didnt even bother with kratom either but it was hell. The withdrawls were so bad and painful I ended up going back to pills. I didnt want to do that no more yet didnt know what to do. I took kratom the next day but it made me feel better than I did taking opiates in the morning. \nHonestly I didnt trust kratom because of hearing it of how it was like vicodin, so I looked it up. I was amazed to see how many people it helped but still was sketchy. The more I read and learned About it, plus experienced for myself, this herb was no way like vicodin. I needed to combat my withdrawls somehow and didnt want to be looked down upon in any way going to a doctor fearing rumors can spread. So I took kratom daily as a way of self recovery. It help, and I believed also it saved my life. From all the opiates I took, I probably be either sick like handicapped or dead the way I was going. \nAfter a month I was back to living a healthy lifestyle through kratom like I was exercising better, more organized in my thinking, no more worrying nor depressed, etc. To this day I take kratom, sometimes daily because of the benefits it gives me.\nI suffered from a mental problem called depression all my life and use kratom as well to help me with it. I dont think this herb is addictive but I depend on it because of what it does for me. Its no different than those who need medications everyday to treat there illness or diseases for there whole life.\nIm aware of those who misuse this product in everyway possible. Its them few with there immature decisions that ruined it all for the millions it helps. But please dont judge this herb by those with bad intentions. I just want to say from my experiences, theres no way anyone can overdose or hurt themselves from this product because you just vomit it all out if you take too much like this herbs got a built in safety mechanism. I know because there were a couple of times in my beggining days of taking kratom I took little too much just for more energy and I got neauseated. I wished all dangerous drugs can do that. Think of the people who still be alive today.\nSo in closing, I say please dont ban this herb. It helps alot of lives than it does ruining it more than anything. Theres alcohol and other pharmacuticals compared to kratom are more dangerous and its legal. Thank you so much for reading my comment. I hope it gave you a different and positive perspective of Kratom. \n\nSincerely, Jojoe","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21609","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a sufferer of cronic arthritis I would like to see more research done.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23045","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for rescinding the Schedule 1 designation!

I'm a 39 year old loan processor. I'm writing this statement in opposition of the DEA putting kratom on the list of Schedule I controlled substances.\n\nI began using kratom approximately 5 years ago to help relieve my occasional migraines. I noticed that it helped diminish my pain without leaving me feeling groggy or under the influence like I would feel when I took prescribed medication for migraines, such as Percocet or Hydrocodone. When I took the prescribed meds, I also couldn't work and risked becoming addicted to them. With kratom, I didn't have to worry about either of these significant drawbacks. \n\nWhile taking kratom for occasional migraines, I realized that it greatly improved my mood and helped me with my anxiety. As a result, when I decided to address my alcoholism, kratom became an ally in my journey. My alcoholism was to a point that I needed hospital care the first day to help me detox. I was experiencing tremors and uncontrollable vomiting. The doctors feared that left unsupervised, I would begin seizing. Day 2 of my detox resumed in the comfort of my home. Although the tremors and sickness weren't as bad, they were still present and a couple teaspoons of kratom helped ease both symptoms. As I've continued my journey of sobriety, I've been faced with the brutal reality of why I drank in the first place. Most of my alcoholism was connected to unresolved anxiety and depression. Doctors have thrown a variety of pills at both issues, hoping to alleviate the problem, but the pills never worked. Instead I became a woman with depression, anxiety, alcoholism and an addiction to prescribed medications. Never feeling like the meds were helping, I would have the doctor take me off of them but still, the issues remained. I've been sober for a year and a half and I've never been happier. I occasionally take a couple of teaspoons of kratom and it helps me with my anxiety and depression. It helps me like no pill or alcohol was ever able. My life has changed incredibly. Instead of daily wishing that I would die, and dying within my disease of alcoholism, I'm a thriving woman living life and contributing to society in a positive way. Even at my sickest, I was able to function and keep a job, support my family, but the happiness was missing. My zest for life was missing. I have it now and I contribute much of my success to kratom for helping with my anxiety and depression. The changes that have occurred within me and my life are drastic and amazing. \n\nI'm so thankful I found this plant. My whole life has changed for the better. Please do not put kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. Kratom is a plant that needs to be researched for its beneficial and healthful properties, and explored as a safe alternative to pain medication. In my quest to continue beating alcoholism, depression, and anxiety, I should be able to choose a plant over medications prescribed by a doctor. I should have the right to choose and so should all Americans. I don't want to ever be forced to put the poison of prescribed medications back in my body but feel I will be forced to if kratom is banned. Again, I implore you to listen to all of our stories and realize that kratom does not produce the effects that scheduled substances do and I ask that it not be scheduled as such. Thank you for listening to my story. If you have any further questions, please let me know.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Iva Carter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Bureaucrats, CEO's of pharmaceutical companies, and politicians that just don't give a damn about the suffering of the common people who have to live with chronic pain.

The first year and a half after they were born I had several steroid injections in my bad, also had 6 nerves burned and did physical therapy for a whole year. I was also taking tramadol and soma that entire time.  All of that did help me a small amount but I still had so much pain it was hard to take\ncare of my babies. I could barely bend over most of the time. Even with taking the prescriptions. \nIn may 2016 I slowly weaned off the drugs and decided to try kratom because I heard a few people who have back problems talking about it. It sounded like it was helping them. So now it's been 7 months of using it. It is an absolute God send! I am able to do anything I need to do on a daily basis. I have less pain now then when I was taking tramadol and soma every day, and there are no side effects at all unlike the pills. I also have went over 24 hours without taking it several times and I had no withdrawal symptoms at all. The only thing that happened was my pain came back and it was horrible. I am hoping I can continue to take kratom and live a normal life.

A simple Saturday lunch turned my life into just that when I broke my foot. The break became exacerbated by CRPS/RSD. I lost a job and went from a healthy and productive life to one filled with searing pain, doctor visits, and, of course, prescription meds. With incredibly high tolerance to begin with, my natural resistance to the effects of medications led to higher and higher doses. I am 5'2 and 130 pounds, and was being prescribed doses that would knock people twice my size out so I could be minimally functional. I was refused dental and medical procedures because anesthesia could not be administered in high enough doses to become effective. I began to research alternatives and came upon my own personal miracle, kratom. A former runner, body builder, and martial arts enthusiast who has worked since the age of fourteen, I had become imprisoned by the pain of my illness, as well as the methods recommended for symptom alleviation. Kratom tea gave my life back to me. I have gone back to work and been able to help support my family again! This simple plant, related to coffee, freed me from the doldrums of pain and putting manufactured chemicals, legal ones, which cause profoundly dangerous side effects, into my body. A tree has given me a relevant and important life. With absolutely zero side effects! As a 56 year old woman, I can attest to the benefits of this plant and its ramifications on the lives of people who want healthy and natural living. Please keep kratom legal.

(look at Florida!) and then when you cant find that, theres this group of illegal immigrants that have an operation which spand ALL of America -making it easier than ever before to get heroine, strong heroine that is easy to get physically addicted to more so than the oxycodone within only a few days. ive experienced this, and you can never EVER imagine the living hell of it unless youve been through it. i spent 4 years going to a methadone clinic almost every day. 4 YEARS, and most people are in there for a large portion, if not their whole life. i went through a voluntary \"dosing down\" all the way from 135mg to 0 because i want to live a normal life, i just want to live period. without methadone, i overtime slowly but surely became just as bad of an alcoholic. and those are just the direct effects of addiction, and i cant begin to explain the indirect effects. but now i dont drink or use opiates, ive been using kratom for over year now and im healthier than ive ever been in the past 10 years. this herb is natural and hardly anymore addictive than caffeine or nicotine, its unconventional for anyone looking to get \"high\" because 1. it doesn't get you high and 2. its hard for almost everyone ive let try to drink because it is so bitter for them. -i dont see Americas teenagers ever having a kratom problem. this is the only thing out there right now that is combating against opiates, i know as long as this herb is legal i will never inject opiates into my veins again, i will never have that fear of not trusting myself. because if you were ever physically addicted to any kind of opiate, no matter what you tell yourself: you will never trust yourself again the way you did before you got addicted. if this herb is taken away, i will always have to live with the fear that one day i could die from opiates. its a miracle i am alive today, and kratom has kept this miracle relevant in my life today.  there's -many times- more people that die from asprin a year than the alleged deaths kratom supposedly caused. i dont see the reason behind this ban but only to help the pharmaceutical companies, because i know they have patented the alkaloid in these opiates that they produce. the same alkaloid in kratom, the kratom that is hardly addictive compared to opana, roxy, morphine, ect.  the kratom that is keeping poeple from taking these hellish drugs. not to mention all the people in real pain who switch to kratom. i will bet everything i have in this world on this: these people will live a longer, healthier life taking kratom than they would opiates. but it seems our government wants the opposite -to kill us faster on many different levels including drug abuse. and this ban proves it. if the DEA was really concerned, they would take time: years testing it to see if its actually harmful enough before they banned it. there is not enough of a problem of social health by any means to ban this plant. The DEA will eventually kill millions of Americans by implementing this nonsense ban, I hope im not one of them. if its such a big problem to public health why is it that almost everyone i talk to about this has never heard of this plant kratom? and a lot of these people have been or are involved in drug abuse. because this ban is propaganda just like the marijuana ban so many years ago. If the DEA doesnt ban this plant, i will truly trust this organization to combat the drugs which ive been addicted to and almost died from, to protect my rights of freedom. I will trust them to help protect my life so i can have a life like everyone else. and lastly, the DEA wants to ban the only true thing combating against opiate addiction during the worst opiate epidemic in American history? please think about this before you decide to ban this plant.

While looking for an alternative to adderal, I found Kratom to work amazingly. Before, Kratom, I really struggled with my school: It took me 9 years to finish my undergraduates degree in Business, and I only completed 6 classes in 3 years of seminary. After Kratm, I was able to focus on my assignments with ease, and able to complete 5 classes per semester. \nI just take 3 grams and I am able to focus for about 8 hours. I have not buit tolerance or dependancis, because I have been taking the same amount for past year.\nI do not think Kratom shold be labeled class 1 drugs.\nMarijuana changes a human mind. Other hard drugs including adderall, destorys people. Kratom is not like that at all.\nPlease do some research before banning Kratom.\nThanks","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3795","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

I have a long history of heavy drinking. I have used alcohol for pain management and for severe anxiety issues. Kratom has played a huge role in resolving both of these terrible issues. It has done so side effect free and in, from what I can tell, a healthy manner. This is another reason to avoid scheduling. This is a substance that should be studied and users monitored by healthcare professionals. Schedule One makes this virtually impossible.

My doctors couldn't tell exactly why I started having seizures, but they decided to take me off all my depression and anxiety medicine... within a week my seizures stopped, I was happy and of course saddened at the same time... I knew the depression would come back and that my life would never be the same... It eventually got so bad that I began to contemplate suicide, it was really the lowest point in my life.  I had been part of an online support group for people with depression and anxiety and a member mentioned this herbal supplement called Kratom... not having much to lose I decided to try it.  I would say that within a few weeks of taking Kratom a lot of my depression started to fade, my anxiety was almost nonexistent, it was amazing, I had forgotten what it was like to live without depression, I couldn't believe that an herb, a plant, something that was non medicinal could make my life, my world so much better... it's been over 5 years since I started taking Kratom, I'm doing great at work, I finished my bachelor's degree, I've purchased my own house, all things that I would not have been able to do under the cloud of depression... the thoughts of harming myself are gone, I can't even imagine thinking like that anymore... but, all that is about to change, and I'm very frightened and confused... I recently learned that the DEA is planning on making Kratom a schedule 1 drug. I could go to jail for taking an herb that has been a god send to me.  I understand the DEA is now taking public comments and I hope they will see my story and consider it while reviewing Kratom, it hasn't been easy for me to document this so publicly, I usually am very private and stay out of the limelight, but this frieghtnes enough to feel that I need to tell my story.  Please help me, help the many people like me that have found a way to cope with the disorders that impact our lives negatively. Please don't block Kratom without proof that Kratom is harming people, I'm living proof that Kratom has been nothing but positive/safe for me and no side effects for over 5 years.

But I wonder if you want the same for people like us. Please do let science test it. I'm sure you'll see a positive in this beautiful herb. I mean I can get WEED but I can't have Kratom? That just seems wrong.  I'm sure your all level headed and aren't influenced by big Pharm. So please consider my plea.

In 2007 I was involved in a car accident caused by an unlicensed driver which hospitalized me. I was diagnosed with two bulging disks and suffer severe neck and back pain daily. Since then I visit the physical therapist and chiropractor daily. I have been prescribed pain pills: Hydrocodone 3 times a day, muscle relaxers: Cyclobenzaprine and anti-inflammatories daily since the accident. After two years of heavy pain medication, my stomach and intestines developed irritable bowel syndrome and other issues the doctors are currently trying to diagnose. I endure severe stomach pain on a daily basis and to the severity to the point at which I cannot eat, and I am prescribed the medication: Pantoprazole to ease this. It is an immense task to manage all of this severe pain daily while trying to work and live life. I am also prescribed Alprazolam daily for my severe anxiety in which I also suffer from frequent panic attacks. It is a full-time job just to manage this pain and anxiety daily while trying to balance the use of daily prescription medication who's side effects are almost as bad as the initial problems. Either way I am living far from a normal life in a daily cloud of fog, pain, fatigue, anxiety, unable to sleep, all of the side effects of medication, without tossing and turning, waking up multiple times in the night, and waking up miserable in so much pain I can no longer lie in bed, it is very torturous. It is also very difficult for me to perform at a job, be myself, or just have a fun normal life. I have tried every kind of herb, natural medication, international and historic remedies to resolve my issues with no success. I discovered Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) through a news article discussing pain management almost a year ago. After adequate research, I ordered and consumed Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) tea. Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) changed my life, my pain is gone and without any negative repercussions or side effects, not only did my pain go away, but my anxiety disappeared as long as I take Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)! I now feel normal, pain-free, anxiety-free, my stomach issues are almost non-existent due to Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa). I have not felt this good since before I was a teenager, it's like taking a breath of fresh air. For the first time since 2007, I have actually been able to get a good night's sleep waking up refreshed! For me Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a miracle, I can productively perform my job and live a normal happy life. Please do not ban Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) or make Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) a schedule -1 drug, if it is I will have to return to a life of daily severe pain, anxiety, misery and agony.

I have decided to pursue my dream of obtaining my PHD in Anthropology with a focus on enthnobotanical research. The reasoning behind my desire is due to my past. A quick overview of why I am writing this today, as a young boy (12 years of age) I had a headache and went to the medicine cabinet and discovered a medication which said it was for pain relief. I took two and then felt a sense of euphoria some time later. I did not make the connection between the pills and my sense of euphoria until some weeks later. I again took the pills, this time not for any pain but to see if I could reestablish that euphoric state. My experiment showed that the pills indeed produce the effects. I looked at the label and saw Tylenol, but the number 3 off to the right. I had started a 15 year battle with opiate addiction. I will not bore you with the details of the hole that I dug which left me homeless, penniless, and without a passion for life. The fear of not being able to talk to anyone about this addiction just drove me further into this dark hole. My addiction to Hardcore opiates continued to lead me down a path of criminal behavior and soul crushing thoughts of suicide. I can say that the fear of coming off of hardcore opiates without any type of cushion made me do things I never thought possible. I have never taken Kratom but based on the stories of people I have actually spoke with it has helped prevent some of the dark corners from taking over their life. By taking this natural plant and criminalizing it many individuals who need help are going to end up in a infinite loop of criminal behavior to try and solve a mental health disorder. To make a drug schedule 1 has typically meant that it has no medical benefit whatsoever. This is just not the case with Kratom. If the fear of potential death associated with Kratom is the main issue here you must look at the total number of deaths associated with actual opiates that are tearing families apart all across this great country. I have lost two of my best friends to oxycontin addiction, which left two widows and 3 children without fathers. Whomever is reading this, take a moment and think through your family and friends and I am sure there is at least one individual who YOU know and love that is struggling with opiate addiction. The manner in which a majority of drugs are viewed by the United States government is unfortunate and telling of a lack of ability to look at the problem with proper perspective. Drugs can be dangerous, the amount of drunk driving accidents that remove my fellow brothers and sisters from this life is horrifying. In addition to the amount of individuals who die from complications from cigarette addiction is awful. Basic common sense says look at just these two drugs and compare it to the amount of Kratom related deaths ( in which individuals have been shown to have numerous pharmaceuticals in their system, and I still have not located a single account of death attributed to Kratom), common sense says, a soft approach in handling a potentially life-saving plant like Kratom should be advised. I understand that interests of drug lobbies and \" the way things typically go\" attitudes have prevented plant medicine from helping our fellow citizens/brothers/sisters/mothers/fathers/grandmothers/grandfathers/aunts/uncles/nieces/nephews and lastly our sons and daughters, stay alive and push through addiction, but I humbly ask, and I ask with thousands of others, please, do not make this plant a schedule 1 drug. No good will come from it. No good whatsoever. I ask instead talk to scientists and research groups in an attempt to realize this plants life-saving qualities, and perhaps act as a stop gap in the thousands of deaths occurring every year in the United States from hard core opiate abuse. Let us as a people step together with government to show that life and liberty do still exist in this great country. I hope this message reaches more than just one person required to read these responses. This message is not unique in its request, lets do the right thing. The reason this message was written today was due to drugs and plants developed to curb opiate addiction. I believe in them and you should too if you are reading my words. With much care and love.

I have been married for 20 years, work at a local elementary school as a one-on-one assistant with a special needs child. I've worked at my job for the past 10 years, before that I stayed at home with my twins until they started school. I had some minor surgeries in 2004 and shortly after these I became addicted to the pain meds that my Dr. prescribed for me. This addiction nearly cost me my kids & my marriage. I finally was able to kick this habit, after several attempts & rehabs, and have maintained my sobriety since June 2006. I'll admit those first few years after quitting were tough, and I craved those pills many times, especially if I was going through something rough. I discovered kratom about 5-6 years ago and I have to tell you that not once have I craved those pain pills! I cannot tell you how liberating & powerful that has been! Those first few years after quitting were rough and I felt as if those pills still had a 'hold on me', even though I hadn't taken one in years! I constantly felt afraid that I would cave in to my addiction and return to my old ways, & lose everything. I have never once felt 'high' while taking kratom, & believe me....I know the feeling. I have never once felt those sickening withdrawals that I was all too familiar with. I've not had to worry about my eyes or appearance of looking high while around friends or family while taking kratom......and most importantly I've not had that fear or 'monkey on my back' feeling of caving in to my addictive cravings and behavior. I can't put into words how important that is for me. I fear for myself and so many others out there if kratom is banned, I fear of relapsing and I know others do as well. Please for me and my family, and so many others do not take away this lifesaver.

I have heart palpitations, sweating, bitchiness, blisters, and every other symptom of an allergic reaction to tramadol, but never had one problem or side effect with kratom.When i take kratom, my eyes do not roll up into my head, and I do not feel a need to eat someone's face.

People are suffering terrible ailments/addictions and it is obvious that we have all gone through various medications with their stupid side effects, with no answers and no real relief. The doctors I have seen are ignorant and do not know how to help me, or do not want to.Kratom is our answer, to endless hours on buses, doctor appts. Pain management appointments etc. We want our lives back. I do not smoke pot.(hate it) do not drink, do not do any street drugs whatsoever. But I need something that works for my pain. I have been on a medical treadmill for 14 yrs. I am tired. I am not, nor have I ever been a drug addict. Sorry to disapoint those of you who have never met me, know nothing about me, yet you sit in judgement. The truth of the matter is this, I wish I didn't need kratom, I wish I didnt need anything for pain. I wish I just had my life back the way it was before the accident. But thats not what I am getting. DEA , I'm just trying to have some sort of quality of life. I wake up in such bad pain that I vomit. I don't wish what I am going through even on my worst enemy. I am a decent person, disabled, and I just want to enjoy my life as much as possible.Kratom gives me 70% pain relief when used with tylenol. I know I am crying out on behalf of many who have found their desperate prayers answered by kratom.Many of us, cannot handle the side effects of the medications we have been given. And kratom seems to help so many different people and ailments. I thankyou in advance for doing the right thing here, and allowing it to remain legal. It is some people's \"Lorenzo's oil\" and our only answer. Thankyou. Last but not least, to those of you on here screaming \"addictive\". Some of us on here  will have a need for pain meds the rest of our lives. I chose Kratom over methadone etc. It is definately the better choice long term.

I assure you, I am not. To further my humiliation, my provider is required to give me a urine test every few months to be sure I'm not selling my medication or taking anything else.  The assumption is not that I'm in pain and need help, but that I am a desperate druggie seeking a high.

I suffer from osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and endometriosis (all diagnosed by a dr). I was prescribed Loratab about 16 years ago, and then it was changed to methadone in 2007. I was then on methadone (through pain management) for 8 years. I never really liked taking the meds, but would not have been able to work or care for my family without them, and after being switched to methadone I was literally STUCK. I became a slave to that drug- I had no idea how bad it was until it was too late. The doctor that put me in it did t exain to me how different it was then the shorter acting meds that I could take 'as needed'. I was only told that it worked better when taken everyday. Then I becme pregnant and when I tried to stop taking it, found out just how bad it was when my OB/GYN flipped and said \"NO! You have to keep taking it or you could lose the baby.\" I was mortified...so embarrassed that I was not such a slave to a pill. After the baby I told the dr I wanted off and they began what they considered a taper, but was way too fast. They dropped me from 120mgs of methadone to 60mg-i went into horrible withdrawal. I remembered someone mentioning Kratom and figured I'd give it shot. Within 20 minutes I was back on my feet taking care of my kids and feeling fine. I immediately felt hope that I would be able to get off the methadone and still care for my family. I began making plans and stopped the methadone taper until I could find out everything I needed to know. About 1 year later I walked out of my pain management clinic and gave up my 8 year methadone script voluntarily to switch to Kratom so that I would not have to deal with the drowsiness and other ill effects (including the stigma) that accompanied the methadone. Although I suffered through wd's, the kratom helped keep me from calling the dr that I was still in good standing with to get my script back. I can honestly say I feel better now then ever did on the pills. I'm clearer headed & I feel the same pain relief from the leaf as did from the pills...it's unreal...i literally can't believe it. I now am able to work more too, without getting too tired or sore. I never feel like I need more and more like opiates are known for and it does not have ANY of the risks involved such as respiratory depression like opiates do. I use only the organic powdered leaf, no extracts or enhanced stuff. \nI beg of you to consider the benefits this plant could have during such a dark time in the US with opiate addiction causing so many deaths. This IS a safe product, as is. I do fear that once it is messed with, alkaloids are taken out and put into little pills, that's when we will see a big increase in problems with Kratom because it would be easier to take too much.

My name is Christy I am 40 years old a professional in mortgage business a wife and a mother of three. I was in a serious almost fatal car crash years ago and have suffered with pain since. I have had several surgeries including spinal surgery. I also have arthritis in my spine as well as all of my joints. I was basically in and out of Drs offices for years and was given narcotic pain medicine to help deal with the pain. Over the years my meds kept increasing and was put into pain management. I had so many different doctors for the different conditions and all of them continued to \"fix me\" with more medicine to deal with the pain. I couldn't get through my day couldn't even start my day for that matter unless I took those narcotics. Again over time the dose that was working before was no longer working so dose had to be increased. I thought well no one really knows I'm on this medicine I'm normal. It got to the point that normal actually was to me seeing someone getting up and doing something with their family or enjoying their day was hard for me to imagine how they did that without taking one of these little pills. I had lost so much weight and my family finally looked at me and said you've got to stop you are killing yourself I just didn't look heathy. So I started researching a natural remedy for my pain to get off the chemically induced pills that the Drs were prescribing and I found Kratom. It has saved my life not only has it helped me with the pain, but has actually healed me in some ways like I can crack my back and move my joints more than I ever could before. The worst and best thing was when I told my daughter I stopped taking that medicine and am using a natural remedy my daughter looked at me and said yes I can see a huge difference. You don't lay around on the couch all day and get up and do stuff with us. I cried because all along I thought I couldn't do anything without the pills but the truth was I wasn't doing anything because of the pills. I thought my children have no idea I'm taking this medicine, but they did and my daughter said yea I prayed you would not have to take those anymore. Please do not ban Kratom it has saved my life my family's life. I don't have to be weighed down taking all that medicine and continue to have to take more and more I take a little  Kratom and is all I need I don't need to take more and more because of it not working like the pills and I'm back heathy again I have a life and can't imagine what ill do if it is taken away from me because I can no longer go back to taking those pills that were killing me if I don't have Kratom I will not be able to enjoy my life with my children it is not harmful it's not chemically made and it truly heals from the inside.

I am 34 years old, and have been taking Kratom for close to 3 years. I suffer from chronic migraines, and was addicted to opiate pain medication (Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Oxymorphone, etc..) for close to 5 years. I am now free of my addiction, due to my doctor's help, and Kratom. My doctors helped me by trying to slowly wean me off of the medication, but the most help I got was from Kratom. Kratom took away the withdrawal symptoms, almost entirely. I still get the uneasy, nervous, \"twitchy\" feeling in my body from time to time, but I take some Kratom, and the feeling is gone in about 10 minutes. It has saved my life, and brought me out of my addiction, as well as helping to bring me out of the depression that came along with the addiction. I am not a doctor, nor a scientist of any kind. I work on fire alarm systems for a living. I have no medical, or scientific data, of my own to back up my statements, only my personal experiences, and experiences of others I have spoken with about Kratom. Everyone's experiences are different, however, the one thing in common with everyone I have spoken with is how much Kratom has helped them. Be it kicking addiction, or helping to alleviate chronic pain. Personally, Kratom has helped me by enabling me to kick my addiction, and also reducing the intensity, and number of migraines I get. The migraines I still do have now pale in comparison compared to the ones I used to get before I started taking Kratom. The migraines, for me, are secondary, though. I began using Kratom because I heard about how it helps with addiction, and from my experience, what I heard was far under-exaggerated. The effects were far better than I had been told. \n    In summary, if the DEA were to make this plant illegal, you would be ruining a lot of lives, and condemning people to a life of addiction because they cannot use this life-saving plant. This plant is truly a wonder of nature, and can work miracles for people who think they have no hope in kicking their own addictions. \n    I sincerely hope that this agency will listen to the comments of all the people who will be negatively affected by making this illegal, and will rethink their position on this for the better.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2467","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher McClure","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 62 year old male and retired Enterprise Architect formerly working at a top IT company.\n\nI am opposed to the announced DEA intention to place kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances because I believe it to be a very safe and effective herb that addresses extreme chronic pain exceptionally well without side effects. Before using kratom, my quality of life was really very low.\n\nI started using kratom occasionally over a year ago as part of a search for a solution for pain. I have been using it regularly over the past 4 months, after seeking treatment for drug-induced peripheral neuropathy for the past two years. I had seen many doctors and received many types of conventional and non-conventional treatment.  Kratom provides relief equaled only by strong opiates, but does so with literally no negative side effects or dependencies.\n\n\nI know that if kratom is removed from public access, my suffering will again increase and I'll be forced to go back onto a a drug treatment plan using strong addictive opiates.  Once that happens, I feel my quality of life will again plummet.  So I ask that the DEA instead allow for extensive research and development to follow a course toward a better America through a respect for human suffering and medical rights.\n\nSincerely,\nANONYMOUS","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17520","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom off the schedule of illegal substances.

I am a 40 year old mother of one. I work full-time as a Computer Systems Analyst and Help Desk Supervisor at the local University. Kratom seriously saved my life. I struggled with an addiction to prescription pain killers. This lead to my home going into foreclosure, none of my other bills getting paid and the possibility of losing my daughter and jail time. All of these problems & issues I was facing, I obviously caused myself. However, before I lost everything, I quit! I did whatever it took to quit. The problem with addiction is that you go through withdrawal & constant cravings. I even went through depressive states & bouts of anxiety. I reference all of those feelings in the past as I found Kratom, which literally saved my life, my home, my daughter, everything!

I'm a 53-year old woman from Portland, Oregon and I'm your constituent.\n I'd like to voice my opposition to the DEA's Intent to Schedule the alkaloids Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, which would make Kratom (Mitragynaspeciosa), a schedule 1 controlled substance with no medicinal value. This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\nAfter an exhausting search for an alternative to the dangerous prescription medications (e.g.: oxycodone, fentanyl patches, Ambien) I've been prescribed for a period of almost 5 years (Ambien for 10), and having tried every known treatment option (e.g.: joining pain mgmt group, biofeedback, chiropractors, acupuncture, massage and physical therapists), I stumbled on a natural alternative treatment option in a pain management forum called \"Kratom\".   I didn't immediately act on  it, but in a moment of desperation, I began to pray earnestly for an answer; to find something that would help.  I saw the word 'Kratom' in a store window.  I did a U-turn, and went in to the shop.  As a 53 year old woman, and mother of four adult children, I felt uncomfortable, but I went to the counter and chatted with a young gentleman, described my situation, and he pointed me to a recommended  variety of Kratom, for my exact circumstances.  I took it home, with instructions, mixed it in a small glass of chocolate milk, and drank it.  I began to experience pain relief within 15 minutes.  I also had a boost of energy, very similar to drinking a couple of cups of coffee. I couldn't BELIEVE it.  Since then, Kratom is basically changed my life!  I had already gotten off of the Fentanyl patch (that was nightmarish to withdraw from), and 5 months ago, I stopped taking oxycodone (after 5 straight years of taking it)  You have no idea how that has felt for me.  Next, the Ambien.\nThen I got the news last Saturday that my miracle was going to go away, and soon.  The reality that I would have to go back to the oxycodone and Ambien I'd been able to kick, was a nightmare (not to mention that it actually didn't work as well).  The answered prayer, was gone.\nYou see, I have been struggling with M.S. (diagnosed in 1994), and have been treated for the chronic exhaustion that is a signature symptom of this disease.  I went through several of the interferon drugs that came (and went) on the market.  Eventually the acute exacerbations began to lessen, and I thought I was on the other side of the worst of it.  Then a routine mammogram changed my life again.  What followed were four surgeries, and radiation, and the resumption of the intense panic attacks I began having with initial M.S. symptoms, when I lived in mortal fear of waking up with a new symptom. Symptoms  that might knock out my balance, turn my body completely numb on one side, double vision, etc., as it had done before.   \nI finally received the news that I was cancer free, but with the new reality, that I would never be able to take the hormone therapies that woman routinely take to combat menopause symptoms.  Thus began the continued nightmare of panic disorder, primarily at night, when hot flashes would wake me up, with the feeling that someone was holding my head underwater, and I was fighting for my life.  PSTD.  I began taking Ambien every night, and I remained on that drug for several years, as well as Provigil, to combat the chronic fatigue of M.S.\nMy neck began to deteriorate over the years as well, likely from computer work I do. The pain was unbearable, interfering with work (I'm a business systems analyst), until it was clear that I had to do something to try to fix it.  ll of those years of M.S. attacks, treated with 4-5 days of Solumedrol steroid IV transfusions took a toll on my cervical spine,  as well as a genetic propensity for spine problems.\nTwo surgeries later, and two cervical fusions at C4-C5, and C5-C6, left me worse off, then when I started.  The pain has been unimaginable and life/career altering.  My surgeon warned me that MS patients didn't tend to do as well, with this surgery. How I wish that he had not been right.AThe inability to have access to Kratom , will mean, that I will no longer be able to run my AirBnB, which I was able to start successfully, when I could no longer perform my chosen career.   I've been able to enjoy life again.  Even my kids remark at how well I look, and that the change is amazing.\nTaking away this safe alternative, will once again plunge my life back into darkness. PLEASE, I'm begging you.\nDo not do this!\nTo me, this is a victory for the drug cartels, and maybe even for big pharma.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7108","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kim Coffman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started using kratom December of 2014.

Which led to the second surgery to extract old hardware and replace it all.  In 2014 I found out that my disc replacement boxes we on recall, as they were causing excess spinal bone build up.

I thought my body hurt just doing the work I do, I can't even imagine what I will feel like once it's hot out again. I'm not that strong, and I always try so hard to keep up with the men around me, and when I do that, I end up hurting myself a lot. Kratom really has saved me. I also suffer from terrible RLS, and this stuff takes it away like it never existed. Kratom is a  gift from god, if there is one. While thousands of people die of prescription drugs overdoses, millions of people throughout history have only suffered a puking fit from an OD of this drug. Unless you have some weird reaction, which you can get from a bee sting, or peanut butter, you'll be fine. We are all consenting adults, if we have the right to give ourselves alcohol poisoning, we should be able to benefit from what actually has something to offer our health, other than liver damage and waking up in a strangers bathtub, thanks to booze.. I've seen people I went to high school with turn from amazing and gifted kids with good grades, to heroin addicts who would sell their grandmother and her small dog for some more, and I've seen some get off it with Kratom. People who switched off it from prescribed medicines for their chronic pain, will have to switch back if you make this illegal. Then if something happens, and they are cast out on the streets because all of their medical bills are too high, they will be suffering ten times worse than they were before, because they had to choose addiction over pain as a result of the new law. The \"withdraw\" symptoms are so minuscule, there is actually a debate as to whether or not they exist. I beg that you think of the people before making your decision.

I am 67, in pretty good health, but the arthritis in my knees had gotten so bad, I was actually getting ready to plead with my doctor about some kind of surgery, for which he said I am not ready yet. I can't imagine the pain being any worse, but I understand, and I have a very good doctor.\nSo my friends sees me hobbling, and asks whats wrong. \"Its especially bad today, my arthritis.\" \n\n\"I take this stuff called kratom for my back pain.\" he said. I didn't know he had back pain. He looks like a wiry athlete and has often fixed things around my house because he is knowledgeable, and is amazing flexible. \"You cannot possibly have back pain\" I said. \"I don't any more. The kratom has mostly blotted it out. I have some with me if you want to try it.\"  I am a skeptic about all things \"New Age\" or herbal. I resisted politely, but then, the pain getting sharper, I said \"Ok, what the hell.\" He brewed me some of it like tea. It tasted like mat, which I drank in Chile when visiting my goddaughter. Bitter, but more like green tea than anything else.\n\nMy friend and i talked for a half hour. We were seated, which took pressure off my knees. Then I had to get up to go to the bathroom. No pain. None. Zip. Shocked, I bent my right knee to see if I could bring the pain back. None. I crouched, something i had not been able to do for two years. No problem. I found I only need to take it once and a while. My painless condition lasted three whole days. There was no other result of drinking the tea. No high. Not even like one cup of coffee. No increased focus, like the mattien in mat offers. Nothing. Just painlessness.  When I read that the DEA wanted to treat it like heroin, whose effects of have seen on two friends who are dying of its use, I was baffled, and I confess, a bit angry. I do not do any other drugs except to have a drink of old scotch now and then. No maryjane. Nothing except coffee, which I doubt anyone is about to ban.\n\nThe people I know who make kratom tea are usually my age, with age kind of pains. Grey hairs. Gentle. Sweet. Nothing like my friends who have done heroin, and who have emaciated their bodies to look like corpses, and who I will one day, probably and sadly, lose. I may have already. I've lost touch with them both. But I think that kratom is just a tea. If anyone mixes it with something else, and it hurts someone, its obviously the something else, not the kratom. I know it can actually help people on heroin...its used in Europe I hear from European friends, to help with that. That makes it precious indeed, a gift of the natural world almost unmatched, save for penicillin from that mold. Those of us who use it and lose pain are very suspicious of putting this on a list of controlled substances. It smacks to all of us of the big Pharmaceuticals, wanting to turn inexpensive leaves into to twenty dollar pills, for their own profits, not ours. \n\nCars, alcohol, and even coffee have more dangerous health effects than a cup of healing tea. Yet no one is proposing getting rid of these because they ARE profitable.\n\nI have no problem with figuring out how it works...such research might provide even more benefits from this plant. Less pain is always better than more pain as far as I am concerned. And considering how the larger number of us in this nation can less and less afford healthcare (a complete mystery to me) it would come across like a very suspicious act to ban kratom.\nIts seems clear from my own research that those who have died from kratom had ALWAYS mixed it with something else, unless it can be proved that some folks are allergic to it, in which case they need to avoid it, the way all my nut allergy friends avoid nuts....which have never been banned because anaphylactic shock can and has taken lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7011","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mark Belletini","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is a very versatile plant that has been used for thousands of years to help people and you are trying to take yet another treatment option away for something as stupid and narrow minded as the fact that Kratom is cutting into opium sales and so you abuse your power to screw over the American people and add another medicinal plant to your list of schedule 1 narcotics that is used to oppress minorities and the poor in the name of power and control.

That reason is that Kratom has saved countless lives and is a positive force in the fight against the opioid epidemic.  Personally kratom has helped me to quit drinking for 3 years and then I stopped kratom and eventually began drinking again- so I started taking kratom again and I was able to ween myself off of alcohol and just use kratom.  I drank because of many reasons but I was diagnosed with the anxiety disorders/phobias; Kratom allows my daily life to be tolerable in the fight against those social phobias and disorders.  \n\nI think there are many different approaches that can be taken to Kratom besides an outright ban.  We know it is useful; numerous doctors, scientists, and those in the psychiatric/psychology field have come forward to give their positive opinions on the plant.  Perhaps the DEA could just consider an 18 plus or 21 plus regulation on the plant should it still see the plant as a threat to public safety.  Though, not one single death has been attributed to Kratom- in each \"death\" attributed to Kratom there are other various and harmful pharmaceuticals involved and some were just plain suicides committed by people who were depressed and on pills that actually have suicide warnings (Ian Mautner for example).  \n\nSo, to conclude, please keep this plant available to the public.  Please do not make the prison industrial complex filled with more people who are just safely using a plant to help themselves supplement their own health in whichever way they choose- this is America after all- we should have our freedoms protected.  \n\nThe number of deaths from Kratom in the thousands of years of its use: 0\nThe number of deaths from Pharmaceutical Opioid Analgesics in 2013 alone: 18,893\n\nI think the numbers and science bear themselves as proof that an industry/substance needs regulation and a serious watchdog, but Kratom is not that substance.  Please make the right choice at this crossroads, millions of peoples health and well being are at stake and turning them into criminals is just plain wrong.  Thank you for reading this and thank you for your contributions to this country and to keeping us safe from dangerous substances,\n\nBest,\nChris Sedgwick","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1369","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Sedgwick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom not only helped me overcome a terrible addition to prescription opioids, but it also has improved my mood (I suffer  from clinical depression and kratom has helped more than prescription antidepressants).

Kratom keeps me from getting overly stressed out in the same vein that Coffee keeps me from getting tired - I can function without it, but my life is vastly improved with it.  The only drawbacks I've ever experienced are mild stomache pains (that I alleviate with a little yogurt or a banana), and some strains can cause me to stay up too late if I take it within roughly 5 hours of bedtime.  \n\nKratom is a wonderful supplement; I personally know several people who've used it to help kick serious drug addictions, and I find my life to be vastly improved with it.

However, let us realize that the abuse potential for Kratom is low.  Far lower than the abuse potential for alcohol or for prescription drugs.  Kratom can be abused in the way that coffee or caffeine can be abused.  \n\nWhat first attracted me to kratom was that it gives me the ability to focus on a task.  I have attention deficit disorder and completing assignments in college was extremely difficult.  Drugs like Ritalin and Adderall left me feeling extremely anxious, edgy, stole my appetite and my sex drive.  Kratom is gentle, subtle, safe, affordable, and simply helps me to get my work done.  \n\nSince beginning using Kratom in my life, I have become happier, healthier and more outgoing.  Let me first outline to you my Kratom use habits: I take 3 to 5 grams of an energizing strain of powdered Kratom in the morning to get my day started, and I take 2-3 grams in the evening to help me wind down and get a good nights sleep.  What has this use pattern done for me?  \n1)\tI have virtually no desire to drink alcohol.  The idea of being drunk and out of control is not an appealing one when instead I can be calm, mentally present, do yoga, read and get a good nights rest.  I went from drinking around 10 to 20 alcoholic drinks per week to maybe 3 drinks per week and oftentimes less.  This change has had radiating positive implications on my life.  \n2)\tKratom has helped me to be more social, outgoing, and less anxious.  I have moved several times in my life, and meeting new people and finding friends in a new place is something that is both necessary and terrifies me.  Alcohol used to be my go-to for meeting people, but that isnt very healthy long term and I often felt like being drunk wasnt my best me.  Kratom allows me to approach social situations with a quiet confidence and be present and relaxed.  \n3)\tI can focus on tasks and finish them.  My use of Kratom has allowed me to read more without being distracted.  Now I love to read!  I also write.  Writing is something that I have always enjoyed, but couldnt seem to focus for long enough to complete anything.  Kratom is a much more suitable alternative for me than Ritalin or Adderall (which both, by the way, felt very addictive and more like a drug high  qualities that I dont experience with Kratom) \n4)\tI have suffered through depression and I know how dark life can be sometimes.  Maybe this is a side effect of the aforementioned changes in my life, but since incorporating Kratom into my life I am considerably happier and life is more bright.  I just feel more in control of my life and this is reflected in the lifestyle changes that have come with Kratom use; working better, sleeping better, having more friends, drinking less alcohol, working out more.\n\nIf Kratom was banned tomorrow I would be extremely disappointed.  I would feel like my government failed me and many others.  Why would a plant that brings such beautiful things into my life be taken away, I would wonder.  What exactly is the DEA protecting me from when a Kratom ban is likely to put me right back where I started (depression, anxiety, alcoholism), I would wonder.  I wonder, too, if anyone at the DEA has ever used Kratom.  Because I am sure that if you did you would see that this is not a plant that gets you high.  This is a plant that gives you a gentle nudge in the right direction and whispers positivity in your ear.  Thats all it is.  \n\nI am a responsible adult.  And as such, I buy my kratom from a reputable source, I dont take more than I need, and I dont combine Kratom with other drugs.  While I can see the potential for building a Kratom habit, this habit is nearly identical to my coffee usage, and breaking the Kratom habit feels nearly the same.  \nI know there are people out there who have used way too much Kratom, and used it intensely and habitually for a very long time.  These people have had trouble stopping their use.  And some of these people have had negative experiences.  Thats okay.  Kratom isnt for everyone.  And those who abuse Kratom are likely to abuse any substance that gets put in front of them.  The vast, vast majority of Kratom users are responsible, reflective adults with wives, and husbands and families and kids and we use Kratom with care and respect.  \n\nIn conclusion, please do not ban Kratom.  The amount of good that comes from Kratom far exceeds the potential for harm and abuse. \n\nDEA, please help the American public - keep Kratom available.   Do not ban!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4304","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 64 yr, old widow.

In addition to these, Kratom helps me maintain a more positive and balanced mood.  The only side effect I have ever experienced in over a year is an occasional dry mouth.\n\nI have a deep personal interest in helping myself, and others who are searching, overcome common struggles through organic and natural methods.  To me, this plant is a true blessing and has improved the quality of my life tremendously.  Through research and discussions Ive also learned that Kratom helps thousands of people suffering from more serious pain symptoms and debilitating addictions.\n\nThe truth about this plant is extremely important for our future and further open research from medical and scientific professionals is necessary.\n\nYour consideration is of the utmost appreciation,\n\nElliott Hunt","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21202","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Elliott Hunt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have gout and inflammation pain  in my leg and I take kratom  which works \nVery well.

As the leaves and their chemical components impact the bodys hormones, they also reduce inflammation throughout the body, including in the blood vessels and arteries. By relieving that tension in the cardiovascular system, kratom leaves are able to help prevent more serious heart conditions, such as atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes. Most users say that Kratom is very uplifting to your mood and cognitive state. Another effect of this plant is that it can cause you to feel a sense of deep contentment and well-being.

I am writing to request kratom remain available for our use. I have found kratom to be a good natural remedy for my chronic pain. I don't want to take take any opiates or synthetic opiates that are commonly prescribed by doctors. Kratom is the only thing I have found that helps, and does not have the intoxicating or addictive properties of the doctor prescribed drugs. Without kratom I suffer from chronic nueropathy that leaves me unable to stand or work after a few hours. Kratom relieves just enough pain as to allow me to function normally. Kratom is just the ground up dried leaves of a plant that is related to coffee. It poses no dangers on it's own. Please let us keep these dried leaves for our personal use. I can understand regulating any concentrated extracts, or synthetic versions of kratom. All that users like me want is continued access to the only natural, herbal pain relief that actually works. In conclusion I hope the situation of people like me will be considered. Most of us cannot afford to pay pain management doctors hundreds of dollars per month, only to be prescribed dangerous and addictive synthetic opiates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13561","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"freddie poer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"You cant see my face but I want to try my hardest to make you see me.

It's a blessing to see a family member recover.  If you think about it, anyone age 21 and over can go right out and buy Alcohol, which is extremely addictive if used long enough, withdrawals, DT's can kill you, and you can also die from Alcohol poisoning, but yet it's sold in about every store you go into.  Cigarettes...Cancer killing sticks, also extremely addictive, yet sold over the counter.  It just doesn't make sense to make Kratom illegal when in fact, it's saving lives !!  I promise you if Kratom is banned, addicts are going to have to resort to hardcore drugs again.  The epidemic of opioid abuse is horrific, and many are finding solace in an herb called Kratom.  NO ONE has overdosed ALONE on just Kratom.  It just doesn't happen.  Now sure, Kratom might have been present in the blood, but there were other substances that caused the overdose.  I think y'all reported 15 or 16 deaths \"related to Kratom use\", yet hundreds of thousands are battling alcohol, pain pills, cigarette addiction, of which both can, and will kill you and are killing as I write this.   Don't take away this precious plant that has saved so many !  PLEASE, do not ban this plant. Unless you've walked in an addicts shoes, or have been a family member of an addict, it's hard to have empathy, but I can assure you, this plant is a true miracle and is turning peoples lives away.

It's similar to the coffee plant and has been used for thousands of years for pain, anxiety and depression.\n\nWhen ingested, naturally-forming plant alkaloids interact with receptors in human cells. Kratom acts on some of the same receptors that opioid-based drugs do, but it is not an opioid. Using this herb does not form the same dependent relationship with these receptors. In fact, it is known to block the receptor's \"need\" to bond with an Opiate, thereby reducing the symptoms of Opiate Withdrawal.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, kratom poses an emerging public health threat. The agency said there was a grand total of 660 calls to U.S. poison control centers about kratom in the last Six Years. Only One death was reported, a person who ingested antidepressant and anticonvulsant medications in addition to kratom. Compare that to the 28,000 deaths this year from heroin.\n\nAccording to the DEA website, Schedule I drugs have \"no currently accepted medical use\", they state this on their website here: https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml\n\nThe two compounds that the DEA is scheduling, are currently used in a commercial medicine called Tramasol:http://tramasol.com/howdoesitwork.html\n\nThis Supreme Court ruling cleary states that a substance may not be scheduled if the Secretary of Health and Human Services recommends that in not be:https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/osg/briefs/1990/01/01/sg900272.txt\n\nTherefore, I am contacting you to request that your agency recommend against scheduling these two chemical compounds.\n\nThe chemicals don't fit the requirements of a Schedule I drug, not only because it's currently used in a commercial medicine, but extensive medical use testing has been done on the alkaloids found in Kratom and has been proven to be effective for a variety uses: http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220090221623%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20090221623&RS=DN/20090221623\n\nKratom can help with detox from dangerous opiates like heroin. It's helped many people in our small community already. We in Massachusetts have a real problem right now with addiction and overdose. The ban on kratom will raise those numbers by taking away the one thing that is helping people overcome a dangerous addiction.\nI am a responsible adult consumer of Kratom. I use it to help with pain after being diagnosed with lyme disease in 2005. The pain from that disease has wreaked havoc on my body. With other diagnosis of fibromyalgia, hyperthyroid, fatigue, multiple food allergies, hair loss, and anxiety to follow.\nI was on many pain medicines until my doctor wrote me off label for suboxone for the pain. I used suboxone for eight years, until further testing of my liver found it was close to failure. I then had to make a decision. One that was so hard to do. The withdrawal from suboxone was worse than the opiate. But now I am so grateful because of kratom. I can run our family business, spend time with my kids and volunteer in the community again. With no adverse side effects. I have been an avid user of kratom now for 3 years.

We know they're addictive, and potentially deadly. But they're still legal? Fine, but to BAN a plant that is NOT addictive, has NEVER killed anyone, and has the potential to help SO many people seems so backwards and opposite of what the DEA is supposed to represent.

I was also taking other pills prescribed such as Adderall, Xanax and anti-depressants. My life was consumed by these drugs, and at one point I'd began to give up. Soon after, a friend of mine recommended Kratom. Within six months, I dropped every drug, including Fentanyl, which was on it's way killing me. They were all replaced by one plant... Kratom.\n\nThe positives out way the negatives when it comes to keeping Kratom legal. You'd be putting thousands of people at risk if you make it a schedule I.

I am a 36 year old Registered Nurse living in Springfield Massachusetts. I was addicted to opiate pain medication (oxycodone) for over 12 years. I was in a car accident and was prescribed pain medication for my back by my PCP. In the beginning I took the medicine exactly as prescribed. However I began to take the medicine for longer than I needed to and became a full blown addict. I did whatever I could to get my \"fix\" and found myself making very bad choices that affected my life severely. I believe part of  my addiction was self medicating for my anxiety and depression.The pills numbed every feeling and I didn't have to feel the horrible feelings of my anxiety and depression. It became a double edge sword because I wasn't able to feel any happiness or joy either. Everything was just numb. I lost everything due to my addiction. My family, my job, my friends, my relationship, my home, and my self esteem. After getting in to a whole lot of trouble and going through addiction for many miserable years, one of my my good friends (a recovering heroin addict) told me about Kratom. She had used this plant to help her overcome her addiction. I did a lot of research on this plant and decided I would try just about anything to get out of this lifestyle. I ordered Kratom and started to take it as a tea to help alleviate my withdrawal symptoms. I never imagined being able to get through one day without opiates but with Kratom I was able to stop this horrible cycle of addiction. I began attending NA meetings. I began to work through the 12 steps. I got a sponsor and worked very hard on becoming sober. I used many of the above tools to achieve my sobriety. Kratom was a very important  tool for my recovery. I began to not feel depressed, I had energy to function, the symptoms of withdrawal and cravings were gone. I had ZERO side effects nor unpleasant symptoms with Kratom. September 26, 2016 was my 5 year sobriety date. I am now working as a Registered Nurse, I own my own home, and I am in a healthy, supportive, sober relationship. I have gained back the trust of my family and my friends. I am able to finally be present for my own life! For the past 5 years I have been able to get my life back on track and I am feeling healthy and productive. Having Kratom as a tool in my recovery \"toolbox\" helped me to become the best version of myself. I am so scared for Kratom to become a schedule 1 substance. Our country is currenltly in an opiate crisis epidemic!! So many young people are losing their lives to heroin and prescription narcotics. Shouldn't the DEA focus on that instead of banning a safe plant ( that by itself has caused ZERO deaths)?  If Kratom was truly able to get someone \"high\" wouldn't there be so many kids using it?  If Kratom was truly dangerous wouldn't the Emergency Rooms be overflowing with people sick from Kratom? The truth is Kratom is extremely safe compared to cigarettes and alcohol which are legal and killing so many people. 435,000 people die every year due to tobacco, 85,000 die every year due to alcohol, 32,000 die every year from RX meds, 7,600 die every year from Aspirin, Kratom 0! The fact is that the majority of people that use Kratom are over 30 years old and are mature adults using it for chronic pain. Banning a substance that helps millions of people is just irresponsible. We have much bigger fish to fry with the opiate crisis! i believe the energy and money spent on banning kratom would be much better spent on the medicines that actually ARE causing an imminent health danger. It has been stated that there have been 660 poison control calls about Kratom in the last 6 years. That is a minuscule amount! Caffeine has received 23,203 reports, 66,300 reports on essential oils, and even valerian root received 1,500 calls. There are an estimated 3 to 5 million Kratom users in the US. If Kratom was truly dangerous, there would be tens of thousands of Kratom related calls, emergency room visits and funerals. If kratom becomes a schedule 1 drug it will be very difficult to to allow for further scientific research to be done on this plant. I ask to please allow Kratom to remain legal and unscheduled to allow for such research. If an all natural plant saves at least one life isn't it worth it to research more? Thank you for allowing me comment on this beneficial plant. Have a wonderful day.

I have never, ever taken illegal drugs, not a sip of alcohol, or ever smoke a single cigarette. In 2011, out of the blue, I started suffering with extreme anxiety and depression. I tried counseling and putting all my efforts and faith in my Heavenly Father. I was counseled to take medication to help me through this, and after many years of being on almost every anti-depressant and anxiety med made by our drug manufactures, my mental health kept declining, along with the money needed to stay on these prescriptions. I was prescribed medication that has been around \"a long time\" (since the 80's), to medication that was recently FDA approved, and my life continued in this free fall. \n    I am a firm believer in modern science and medication, and know that these advances are direct blessings and guidance from heaven. But I also believe (to an extent), in natural remedies that have been used for thousands of years, much longer than current anti-depressants. My psychiatrist recommended I try Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa), and incredibly, my life returned to normal. I became the husband my wife married again. I became the kind of Father my kids deserve. I became myself again! And now I hear the DEA is trying to take this away. \n    My heart is aching and it is physically and emotionally painful to think that this resource will be taken away from me, and that I will return to the state of depression- a state the robbed me of almost 4 years of my life. I am a living witness of the effectiveness of Kratom. Taking this away will essentially end my functional life,  and family will have to struggle with the DEA's decision to do so. One day in the future, if Kratom is proven to be a safe and effective treatment in the eyes of the DEA, I will have gone through the imminent torture of depression for nothing. \n      With thousands of years of use, this has been THE safest drug the DEA has ever classified as a controlled substance. I feel this is much safer than the Xanax and Adderall that I had to consume daily in the past. By taking away Kratom, I feel as if the oxygen we all require to live is being taken away.\n    I am pleading with anyone that will listen, I need your help.\nEven if Kratom use requires a prescription and additional oversight, that will at least allow me to LIVE. That will free the suffering depression has on its victim's family members. \n    My end goal is to get my life back, prescription AND Kratom free. But until that happens, Kratom is the one thing keeping me living a quality life, that allows me to contribute to society, and most importantly, my family.\n   Please, please, please help! This is literally life or death for me and many others. I've never needed help with anything like I do for this now.\nThank you for your continued service to our country and its citizens.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0155","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 59 years old and retired as a lieutenant with 30 years of law enforcement in 2008.

I am now working two part time jobs. I play with my grandchildren, work in my yard, and just live a normal life!\n\nI strongly oppose the DEA's proposal to put Kratom on a controlled substance list. As former law enforcement, I have seen what heroin and other similar drugs are,and this is not what Kratom is! Kratom is a natural plant in the coffee family that helps many people live a better quality of life, and it should remain available to the US citizens as a natural supplement. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5351","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Simpson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"6 years ago, I had a drug problem.

Please do not  proceed with the emergency scheduling of kratom or it's alkaloids. \nIt is unfortunate that my story is not unique:  I have discovered that there are so many of us who are going through such similar experiences. I am so proud of all of us that we have found the strength to deal with  chronic pain and the depression and anxiety that so often accompanies chronic pain/illness. I developed an  atypical facial neuralgia and many other symptoms attributed to an autoimmune disease over 13 yrs ago. I have lost so much. I supervised a staff of 30 in a large non profit law firm for many years. I had to leave my job  due to illness and went from helping others every day to being bedridden.   I lost many relationships and even lost my home. I saw over a dozen specialists- always thinking I would get better- but eventually they could only address the symptoms and that meant a lot of medicaltion. Medication I was grateful for. Grateful for the pills and patches that gave me some breaks from the pain. I took these medications as prescribed for ten years and  as the dosages went up, so did the side effects. Eventually, they stopped being effective enough to justify the side effects. How many more fentanyl patches could I fit on my arm? I took a break from these medications three years ago. I then discovered kratom. It does not take my pain away  completely but i find that it provides me with enough relief that I have not had to return to narcotic meducation. It does not impair me. During this time I have been able to pursue meditation, acupuncture and other holistic treatments that are hard to follow through without the relief I get from kratom. Kratom is not a cure for anything I am aware of and not a substitute fir medical care. My bloodwork is done regularly and there has been no adverse reaction to my use of this botanical substance.  I miss helping people and have been able to start some volunteer work. I have hope. \nThe opiod epidemic is frightening. Most overdoses are accidental. It could have been me. Pain is now undertreated as the risk of adverse effects and overdose is high. But how can we expect people to live with chronic pain? I am so thankful that I have the choice to utilize this natural substance and increase my quality of life. \nI am begging you not to take this choice away from me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15427","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Ive been buying kratom for last few years...and its only thing that works for my period cramps..headaches.body aches..and doctors will not prescribe pain meditation which i understand..iv tried every type of over the counter pain medication  and it dont work..i dont know why people say that kratom bad when its not..and come on schedule 1?

I have ingested kratom in the past to combat pain as a result of a physical accident which had rendered me unable to walk for 5 weeks and by taking kratom it made the pain very manageable and after I felt I no longer needed to take kratom there were no withdraw effects to associate with the absence of ingesting kratom. I believe more research is needed with kratom to determine any health consequences in ingesting kratom but I have not personally had any health abnormalities as a result of ingesting kratom. I believe kratom should not be made illegal because there is a lack of evidence that it is in any way dangerous. However I believe there should of course be an age restriction so that only those who are 18 and over are able to purchase it. Kratom has benefited the lives of many people and taking that away from people could potentially do them harm rather than good. Many people rely on kratom to function properly in society. I ask that you please reconsider making Kratom a scheduled substance. There is a lack of credible evidence that ingesting kratom is directly responsible for dangers that people have inflicted on others and/or themselves. Thank you for your time reading this.

I'm surprised that you asked for public opinion in this Kratom matter and I believe it's a step in the right direction.  After all, more people are arrested for Marijuana use than all violent crimes combined.  To me that seems like a waste of our police force, and placing Kratom on the same list as the aforementioned would only further this waste.  It's time to stop prosecuting people for natural herbs and start healing the people who have serious manufactured drug problems.  Manufactured by companies that dump money into politics to keep spreading sickness under the guise off medicines.   Let's be real, I know that plenty of people stand to make plenty of money by making kratom illegal, but this comes at the cost of others freedom. Just because you take a different moral standpoint on mind altering substances doesn't mean the entire country should have to adhere to your beliefs.  \nTo whoever actually reads this, if you drank an alcoholic drink this week or support the American right to do so, then you should deeply consider if it is right to prosecute people for using other substances to relax.  Namely substances that don't hurt or kill people. You may claim people died in connection to kratom use, but of the 15 people who died of serious narcotic drug overdose that just happened to have kratom in their system as well , all of them probably had breakfast that morning too. That doesn't mean we should outlaw pancakes additionaly..\nIf you make this illegal, it will just be another way that striving, honest, and hard working AMERICAN people find themselves in jail. If we truly want to become more intelligent and see the human race become healthy and better ourselves then it is time to stop basing our laws on what YOU think and more on what WE THE PEOPLE know.  And how can we know anything if our government makes it illegal to know truth by banning research these medicines?  Or when the DEA makes these decisions based on \"hurried\" research. (Such as the hurried fda research you asked for)  When is it even intelligent for an enforcement agency to decide on what needs enforced? That's not the system of checks and balances I was raised from a child to believe in. I really do believe you all have your jobs because youre dillegent hard working enforcers, but that does NOT make you scientists.

About 9 years ago my wife and I let a childhood friend of our children move in with us together with his wife and 3 kids (2 more kids came along later). He was down on his luck and this was supposed to be temporary until he could get good steady work. Unknown to me he was an addict. He had been addicted to prescription pain killers before moving in, was on a methadone maintenance program which he abused during the time he lived with us, and eventually became hooked on methamphetamine as his life spiralled out of control. At rock bottom he could only hold cheap jobs for weeks at a time until the paranoid, psychotic episodes fueled by meth overwhelmed him and made him a threat to himself, his family and us. He was kicked out of the house but came back about a month later. His situation looked hopeless, and sometime during this time he started using kratom to relieve the chronic pain from his rotten lifestyle and physical work. It worked as a painkiller, but the bonus was that he kicked his meth habit. I don't know the how or the why. All I know is he started taking kratom and he stopped taking meth.

I spent many years being addicted to opioids that ended up doing more harm than good. They affected me physically, mentally, and emotionally in negative ways. In addition to the physical pain, I have suffered from severe depression and patterns of self-mutilation in my younger years.\n\nKratom has allowed me to be functional physically, but it's so much more than that. It has granted me a sense of well - being emotionally that I never experienced with all of the psychiatric drugs I was prescribed. It is not just medicine for pain, it's medicine for the soul.\n\nI am no longer depressed, I am in far less pain than I have been at any point in the last decade and a half, I am no longer suffering from an addiction. I am a functioning, working, contributing person now. I work full time, I am active as a coach and referee for my kids soccer. I am a good, giving, loving human being again. This is directly attributable to this wonderful plant. All of this with NO side effects, no dependence, and no self - hate and shame.

Plain and simple. It is an all natural herb with very few side effects. None of which are deadly. I honestly feel that this ban is somehow connected to Big Pharma and their new synthetic drugs (MGM-9, among others) that is in human testing stage as we speak. Everyone knows that Kratom is not dangerous. This scare tactic propaganda of Mitrogyna killing people is absolutely absurd.  However, there are some places that probably sell altered versions of this herb, which could lead to dangers. But real kratom has done  nothing but help people. I feel that it SHOULD be regualted in some form to keep people safe from chemically altered kratom products, but the Kratom itself should not be illegal. Tylenol kills thousands of people every year, but I could go to the store right now and pick up a hundred bottles of acetomeniphan. So why would Kratom be illegal, but not something like Tylenol? I just don't understand the reasoning behind this ban. It makes absolutely no sense. Unless Big Pharma is involved. That is the only logical explanation to this ban. Kratom has been around for hundreds of years, and it has never been an issue.... Until the big pharmaceutical corporations started to synthesize the chemicals. Now all of a sudden, Kratom is dangerous??? Sounds fishy to me. \nMaking Kratom illegal will cause far FAR more problems that it fixes. People will start turning to REAL drugs, like heroin, methadone, Xanax, and Oxcontin. And THAT is whats going to cause deaths! Not Kratom. But the Kratom ban!\nPlease, help save lives!

I have peripheral neuropathy from a form of spinal cord damage called Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), caused by a spine surgeon's incompetence. I have been suffering with this condition for over four years and have permanent nerve damage and constant nerve pain in my right leg. By the end of a day of teaching, It feels like someone is hammering on my foot. Sometimes I have to close my door during my prep period and cry for a while because the pain is so bad. I feel terrible pins and needles 24/7 all the way down the back of my entire leg. I've tried gabapentin and Lyrica as well as low dose opioids. No matter what I take, I have constant pain. Since it's been over three years since Dr. Hart's arrogant incompetence left me with CES, my condition is now permanent and will never improve. Because of the constant pain, I struggle with anger, depression, and anxiety. It is very difficult to somehow find the strength to keep going despite all the terrible symptoms of CES. \n\nI decided to try Kratom a few months ago since I've repeatedly read that it helps with neuropathy. I make a tea out of it, adding an herbal tea bag and filtering out the leaf powder to make it a bit more palatable. Even so, it is a horribly bitter tasting drink and it is exceedingly unpleasant drinking it.\n\nI find that Kratom tea helps suppress my neuropathy for several hours after I drink it and I am grateful that I have found another way to treat my constant pain. Kratom is also a mild sedative that helps me handle the stress and anxiety of my disability. I drink it 1-3 times a day however, I can skip drinking it whenever I like. I haven't experienced any physical habituation at all, unlike with the gabapentin that I also take that leaves me with terrible withdrawal symptoms if I skip a dose.\n \nThe overall psychotropic effect of Kratom is very mild, and provides about the same amount of sedation as perhaps half a glass of wine. Ingesting Kratom is disgusting, so I find the likelihood of someone wanting to abuse this substance highly unlikely when much more palatable inebriating alcoholic drinks are easily bought.\n\nQuite frankly, making kratom a schedule 1 drug is absolutely ridiculous. This decision is based on a handful of deaths over several years where kratom was present in a multidrug cocktail that caused these deaths. No one has died just from ingesting kratom, unlike the six people who die daily from alcohol poisoning. \n\nKratom helps countless numbers of people battling a wide range of maladies. Taking this away from us and making us felons simply for possessing a powdered leaf is draconian and patronizing. We are adults and should have the right to take whatever herbal supplement we wish. I purchase my kratom from a reputable online vendor and am certain that the product that I'm buying is of high quality. I should be able to continue to treat my chronic pain with kratom without government interference.

I grew up in a verbally and emotionally abused home. At the age of 12, a family member sexually abused me, and with that, caused me to have high anxiety, along with my depression. I have been on every depression medication you can think of, with no success. In 2011, I was in a very severe and traumatic car accident, that broke my spine in two places (had to have rods put in, to help heal my spine correctly, then had them removed), broke both of my hips (a pin in the right hip, that cannot come out), shattered my jaw (plates were put in my jaw, which cannot come out), broke my ribs, broke my femur, punctured my lung, had bleeding of my brain, and sadly the list can go on. I was 26 years old, at the time, and on very strong pain medications, along with my depression and anxiety medications. My life wasn't my own, I had no hope of getting anywhere close, to having a productive, meaningful life. I also couldn't work, and was then considered disabled, and collected disability. I needed my life to change, and was desperate to find something that could help me. That's when I came across Kratom. I found it very hard to believe, that this plant could help me in any way. I was skeptical, but I honestly had nothing else to lose, so I decided to give it a try. I can't even begin to explain, how much Kratom has helped me. It's helped with my pain, and made it manageable, my depression and anxiety is at ease, and I have a sense of well being again. I finally have a smile on my face, after all these years, and I started to feel hopeful again. I am now a wife, of an amazing man, and a mother, of a beautiful boy, who are both my world. I also work part time, to make extra income for our household, which I never thought I would do again! I wouldn't be where I am now, if it wasn't for the help of Kratom. So please, don't ban it! It's helped so many people, and it will destroy so many lives, if it gets banned. Kratom has honestly saved my life!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16527","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Anything beneficial to the folks and 'profitable' to the drug makers are black balled by authoritarian politicians that think they know best.

This is a very painful injury and surgery could leave him with a permanent limp - something most young men do not want.  He is not a candidate for long-term opiate use because he is still relatively young.  A few tablespoons of Kratom of day manages the pain quite well.  I am a psychology professor and I spent quite a bit of time learning about Kratom and how it works and I believe it is safer for him than, say, Percocet.  It does have mild opiate properties but they bind to opiate receptors in the intestinal track and does not affect the limbic system in the brain as a narcotic pain killer would.  This allows him to have a life where he is not in a stupor or euphoric.  To take this away from  him will be devastating as he will not have another avenue for pain relief.  I hope that Kratom remain on the market and perhaps there does need to be education for how to use it but don't take it away from people who use it not only for pain relief but also as a drug to move away from heroine and other strong narcotics.\n\nSincerely,\n\nErick R Williams","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9692","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erick Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom users are not criminals.

My point is that if kratom is so much less damaging than even acetaminophen then why does the U.S. promote something dangerous.

Shortly after that my family physician suggested that maybe the best way to manage my hip, back, and shoulder pain caused by the accident, was a perscription for a pain relief called Norco. I will admit this really helped. My doctor did advise me that it was a strong medication and I should use it carefully because of possible addictive properties.  I never had any of the so called problems others have had on this or really any other medications like it. When I was in pain I used it. Sometimes as many as three or four times daily for weeks at a time. If I was feeling less pain I would stop using the Norco. I never filled prescriptions I wasn't going to use.  I used about 160 doses a year on average. My problem came after a job relocation moved us to a state where finding a doctor that would even take me and my family as new patients proved to be a challenge.  After looking at my medical records and agreeing that my history would show that I should have Norco pain relief prescribed. They told me that I would  basically have to start from square one with a \"pain coach\" and physical therapy all over again. I am  fortunate  that a have good insurance and have a good paying job.  However I do not have the time nor the patience to go through these costly efforts.  Quite frankly it seemed like I was just another paying customer for my new doctor.  Now I was desperate.  I take care of my body. I workout. I stretch.  There are many things I've learned over the years to manage my pain.  However there is no cure! My  x-rays MRIs and ultrasounds show that I truly need other methods to manage my pain.  I did not know what to do.  I did not want to turn to black market methods. I was getting desperate. A  friend that knew of my situation and had  been prescribed similar medication  suggested I try  Kratorm tea.  I have to tell you it's the only way that I have left to manage my pain.  It's not better than my prescription medication was.  However it works.  I don't use it every day.  when I do need it I'm happy to have it.  Personally I can't see why it's a big deal. I can make a few speculations.  I think it's easy for people to criticize make snap judgments and even get downright nasty.  I don't think that's necessary.  All I will say is please do the necessary research. Take the time and make a levelheaded decision before you just take away something that works and is affordable.  I would be willing to be a test subject to show you that the every day person can use Kratom responsibly and effectively. I'm a family man. I don't see anything wrong with Kratom what so ever. It works!  Do the right thing here.

I am 37 years old, a father of two, and I work in Commercial Building maintenance. I started supplementing with Kratom in early 2014, after reading about its potential for mitigating back pain. I have Sciatic pain from a compressed disc in my back, which was seriously affecting my ability to do my job, where I am on my feet for 8-10 hours a day. Kratom reduces my pain to a manageable level and helped keep me on my feet and working hard. It's affordable for those of us who are uninsured, I have not become physically dependent on it, and I have not experienced any negative side effects in my almost three years of use. I know there are many others like myself out there who have benefited greatly from this safe, natural alternative to prescription painkillers, and I ask you to please reconsider the proposed ban.

I am a college graduate and executive with a communications company.  I am writing to plead with the DEA to withdraw their ban on Kratom.  \nAbout 8 years ago, I went through a divorce.  It was a very hard time in my life and left me with some depression.  I was prescribed anti-depressants by my doctor and did not like the side effects.  I searched for \"natural anti-depressant\" in hopes of finding something to help me through that tough time in my life.  I came across Kratom and bought some of the powdered leaf.  It worked on my depression!  It did not make me \"high\" and allowed me to stay focused on my work and my child.  I quickly realized it also helped me with energy and mood.  I had no side effects and have never experienced any feelings of being \"drunk or high\".  It's effects for me are pretty mild but pleasant.  I kept drinking the tea as I really did like what it was doing for me in my life.  I am able to work, socialize with friends and be a productive tax payer.  It has been a part of my life for 8 years now and I have had many times where I took breaks from it.  There certainly are some mild symptoms from quitting, but nothing like quitting smoking!  I consume about 10-12 grams of powdered leaf brewed into a cup of tea about 3 times a day.  I've never felt the need to consume more.  I can't imagine anyone overdosing on this benign substance.  Anytime I've taken more than usual amount, it results in some mild nausea with no increase in the pleasant effect.  It literally makes me a more pleasant person to be around.  I work a stressful job and this tea helps me maintain a positive attitude and remain focused on the things I need to do without stress!\nIt really is a remarkable plant.  I've followed this case closely and read all of the comments about big pharma wanting to eliminate it so that they can continue prescribing their drugs.  I don't know if that's true but it doesn't sound far fetched.  I would say that if the DEA is being influenced, they are being short sighted.  All these people who use this product to stay off harmful drugs is a blessing to our health system and saves the tax payers money!  I would suggest anyone trying the product to see if it helps with their mood and energy level.\nThank you.\nCSW\nOklahoma City, Ok","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3081","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it may concern,\n  Kratom has been a god send for me.I am was injured in a serious accident 25 years ago.Opiates have been the only thing to help with the pain.Kratom helps me go off opiates to give my mind and body the much needed break from that drug.Making it illegal will make things much worse for me and many like me.\n       Thank you,Anonymous","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15088","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Christine Polito, I am 51 years old, and am self-employed as a professional organizer.  \n\nI oppose the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances.

Yes you may think that Kratom is the factor to \"some\" deaths or health comlications; but is that really a known fact? I dont believe it is or even could be. Kratom is simply a tea consumed by many to help with different health reasons. Its ones choice and should be ones right to take it if they would like to. Many people take kratom to help them with everyday health problems other than choosing a prescribed drug that you cab eventually get hooked on. The US alon has seen to many deaths due to drugs, and kratom is a way to end that. So why would the DEA want to take something away that actually helps people? Its our right and freedom aa US citizen to be able to consume what we would like. Especially if it helps with our well been. Kratom has helped so many lives the natural way. Kratom has helped change my partners life who once was addicted to pain killers. He had been using prescribed suboxene before finding out about kratom. Suboxene was just taking over his life like the pain killers. Doctors say its a way of recovery, but really its not. Suboxene is just getting you hooked on another drug. Kratom is not addictive. Its simply just a tea. So i write this in hopes that Kratom will not be scheduled as a level one narcotic.

I find that Kratom has more desirable effects than coffee with fewer side effects. I was terribly disheartened to find out that the DEA was trying to move it to a schedule one \"chemical.\" This action would result in a great disservice to many citizens who benefit from this plant daily.\n\nAfter seeing several drug policies fail and only increase violence and the prison population, I don't understand why schedule one is fitting for this plant, the idea alone disgusts me. I didnt trust the FDA or DEA before, this makes me sick to my stomach. How could I trust a government agency that makes moves based on poor data with opaque motivations? \n\nI am a 31 year old man with a son, a girlfriend of 8 years, and many bills to pay. I work as a tile installer and I am currently trying to become self employed. I am not a victim to Kratom and don't require protection from it. I don't go out of my way to mess up your life. You just so happened to decide to ban a plant on a whim, that many use on a daily basis, and life just goes on after that? No questions asked? You guys tried doing this without a public comment period, no legislation, no realistic justification whatsoever. Now as a private citizen with very little means to defend myself, I have to defend my harmless, productive, responsible lifestyle to a government entity that is obviously detached from its citizens. \n\nYou stand to gain from messing with us, we stand to lose Kratom and time that we could've spent doing something better  than talking down a bully.  I don't see who benefits from Kratom being moved to schedule one. Perhaps you should reassess what your job description actually is and use your resources to fight something that's worth fighting.\n\n Look at all of the junkies, tweakers, criminals, and victims the  drug war has created, Kratom users are not these people. Don't create more criminals so you have something else to do.  Stop contributing to this nanny state and recognize real threats to help protect the government that pays and attempts to trust  you. How about you get all of the BPA out of my cans? You guys are worried about Kratom? Are you worried about coffee? Aspirin is a terrible chemical and I can buy as many of those as I'd like. \n\nMy final comment is- if you ban this plant what you are doing is immoral and will create strife, unnecessary strife, to people who are already dealing with the hardships of life. Sorry if I came on strong but I feel strongly about this. This whole scenario is unbelievable and heartbreaking. Have some compassion for your fellow man, don't simply use ill conceived data and cherry pick it to justify your actions.

I always hear of politicians and government agencies/programs doing \"everything they can for our veterans,\" but not understanding that there are things like this plant, or even marijuana that can actually treat pain and PTSD. This plant and others like it, namely marijuana, will be legal all across the U.S. one day. And you and your kids will have to look back and wonder what the hell was it you wasted your entire lives for. Keeping people from a plant, while doctors are prescribing and handing out addictive opiates like candy. Don't be a damn idiot.

It offers comfort that I don't receive from other remedies without any side effects (that some other options cause)... Kratom is safe. My entire family as seen me thrive on it and I now have my 80 year old Nana taking it and my 59 year old mother. Most recently my 52 year old Aunt who suffers from Lupus.

I will acknowledge that every individual has a different propensity to addiciton, however with that said the dangers of an overdose or withdrawl seem to be minuscule compared to other substances. The legality of this plant will ensure further research, which will help us better understand the true nature of its healing or harming properties. I will end this comment by saying that the ban on Kratom will in my opinion cause more harm than good, mainly for the fact that it is used by former opioid addicts to stay clean.

I had just had spinal surgery, and was still struggling with my recovery.  Unfortunately, I am allergic to opiate based pain medications, so as a sufferer of chronic pain I was without any kind of recourse or significant relief.  I have ran the gammit of over the counter anti-inflmmatory pain releivers, and really none of them work anymore.  Then, as I said, I was told about Kratom by someone I actually truly trust.  It was like a miracle.  Suddenly, I had some releif from my daily pain.  I still don't utilize kratom on a daily basis, I prefer to only use the least that I need and only when I truly cannot do without it.  I have PsA, which mostly effects my spine, but I also have uveitis, and sacroiliitis, along with tons of other stuff that seems to go hand in hand with PsA.  It gave me back my quality of life - something that had been very much missing long before I got my diagnosis - I got approved for disability this year as well.  Kratom has made  my life better - I have some relief from the worst of my pain.  It does not give me a \"hangover\" which most pain medications did when I would force myself to take them out of a desperate need to get away from the physical agony of just moving around.  Kratom does not make me feel \"loopy\" or altered mentally in any way - I can function.  The only difference is that I am not in as much pain as before - THIS is what pain medications are SUPPOSED to do.  It is my sincere hope that this herbal remedy will remain available for the thousands of people whom depend on it for non-opiate pain relief, and for countless other reasons.

Below are several reasons why.\n\n1) The government has no moral right to prohibit an individual from consuming what they want to consume. Personal liberties that do no harm to anyone should not be taken away. The United States is widely viewed in the world as a place where people are free to live their lives as they see fit as long as their actions do not harm others. Sadly, I know the United States is not the world's leader in freedom and personal liberty anymore and it is becoming less and less free inch by inch, regulation by regulation. The world's perception of our country is not the reality. America is not the world's leader in freedom and that is both infuriating and deeply saddening. \n\n2) Kratom enriches people's lives for the better. It improves quality of life. It gives people energy and helps them overcome anxiety, fear, & depression, I have spoken to so many people whose lives have been positively affected by it.\n\n3) There isn't one legitimate argument in favor of banning kratom. If there is no legitimate reason to make the plant illegal, it shouldn't be made illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2314","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Graham","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing this comment in hopes to let my voice be heard as an American citizen, that I have had positive life changing experiences with the plant that you are trying to publicly ban. Kratom and its active ingredients  mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine have only proven to be helpful in my life long battle with Anxiety, Depression, and prescription drugs. I have had many life altering experiences that have lead to many mental battles throughout my life, and it has held me back in lots of ways including career and education. My mother passed away in 2002 when I was 14 to an opiate addiction she could have curbed with the help of Kratom. I fell into the same practice when I found I could get mental relief when using opiates and was stuck addicted for years to the hopeless medication. One day in 2013 a friend suggested I try Kratom instead of going to a doctor for my anxiety that was starting to harass my conscious mind. I have used to plant since and it has changed my life around for the better. I no longer feel tired and depressed throughout the day, I have had 0 problems with work or health since I have found the plant. I wish I could turn back time and give this miracle plant to my mother and save her life. I will never change my perspective on this, I lost my mother to pharmaceuticals and we found something that works now. Don't take something good away from us that we truely could use for bettering our lives as the American People. Please reconsider your stance, because most of use are responsible adults and tax paying citizens that just wish to treat our ailments.

I am a 34 year old father of 3. I'm not particularly wealthy, but I love my work as a customer support specialist for REI. My love for the outdoors and my amazing company keeps me happy. I spent the 6 years before REI as a Podiatric Medical Assistant, with a national certification in the field. I have spent many years serving and taking care of others.  \n\nIn my time as a PMAC I developed terrible low back pain that often prevented me from being able to even walk. I was prescribed opiate medications for pain, which eventually became an addiction.  My addiction to opiate medications nearly cost me my life. I have since gotten off the opiates but, the pain came back as strong as ever.  I am deathly afraid to take them so, I didn't.  My quality of life went out the window.  My attitude, my sleep, my ethic, everything that I needed to provide for my family was almost gone.  \n\nA friend of mine recommended Kratome to me for the same problems he was having. I tried it and it absolutely turned my life around. It gave me enough relief to get through an entire day, with out being doped up on pain medicine and also helped stabilize my mood.  I ran into a gentleman today while getting my Kratom.  His exact words were \"Kratom saved my life\". I urge you to really consider what Kratom means to people.  It's quality of life for me and so many.  And so many can get off out of the opiate epidemic with this stuff. The 15 people that have died using Kratom?  Shellfish has killed more. Alcohol has killed more. Malpractice has killed more.

For years I've suffered from irritable bowel\nsyndrome with symptoms so severe my doctor thought that I might suffer from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Since I was\na teenager 5-6 times a month I would wake up with severe abdominal pain that would have me on the floor in fetal position rocking\nmyself until the pain subsided. A few times a month this would happen in the morning shortly after getting to school or work\ncausing me to have to run to the bathroom while in the middle of something important. in 2011, I was in a car crash that injured my\nback. I was prescribed hydrocodone for the pain for a few months. Immediately after that was done I suffered a case of bronchitis\nthat I just could not shake for 2-3 months. To deal with that I was prescribed tussionex, a cough syrup with codeine added to it.\nOne thing I noticed while being prescribed opiates was that my pain subsided. However, my scripts ran out and all of a sudden\none morning I woke up in full blown withdrawal and realized I was addicted. Being in a small town and knowing where to get opiates\nthrough illicit means it was not long before I was destroying my life and my family's life. I was married and had a 4 year old daughter\nat the time. In early January of 2013 I went to inpatient rehab. I stayed clean for a few months, but because of the pain it did not\ntake me long to get back on opiates again. Getting desperate and knowing that if I went back to rehab I would lose my job,\nI searched the internet for alternatives. That's when I discovered kratom. I took a gamble and ordered some out of desperation\nand it was like magic. I no longer craved opiates and my IBS subsided. I became such a believer in the plant that I told everyone\nI knew about it who I thought could benefit from it. I got involved in online communities and helped other people use the plant\nto get clean. Whenever legal problems with the plant would pop up in a state, I would my best to help out. I made friends with a\nlocal vendor and went to work for him part time just to help out and learn more about the plant. He showed me emails that he\nreceived from his customers. Hundreds, possibly thousands thanking him for providing a product that helped them get their lives\ntogether for various reasons. I've spoken with teachers, doctors, police, veterans and every walk of life that you can imagine who\nhas found great benefits from kratom. This is life or death for some people. I've taken kratom every single day since 04/22/2013\nand the absolute worst I've experienced from it is the occasional bout of constipation. So as of this writing, that is 1318 days since I\nfirst started taking kratom and I've had no problems with it. Not once during that entire period have I had an IBS flare up. \n\nI understand the concern you might have with the plant based on sensationalist news stories and grieving parents trying to find\nan answer or a culprit to the loss of their child. However, if this plant is scheduled, you're going to be seeing a lot more grieving \nparents and considerable loss to the economy.

My job is to sue pharmaceutical companies over the undisclosed side effects of their drugs.  As the DEA well knows, the side effects of pharmaceutical compounds are often quite significant, and can in many cases outweigh the benefits.  As the DEA also knows quite well, it is the Big Pharma lobby that has shaped so much of drug policy in this country.  And Pharma would have the DEA add to its already enormous workload the prohibition of kratom, a harmless leaf ingested in unprocessed, powdered form.  There is no need to divest DEA time from issues such as interdiction of heroin and fentanyl, true public health emergencies at this time, to enforce prohibition of this benign coffee-like plant.\n\nAs you are also likely aware, kratom operates on many of the same receptors as opiates.  Apparently, it has been used as an effective alternative to heroin or other opiates by thousands of addicts.  And, it carries none of the risks of those drugs; it does not act on the same receptors which lead to overdose by suppressing CNS function.  the banning of kratom, then, would immediately and certainly cause a spike in opiate/heroin overdoses.\n\nAs an alcoholic myself, I can attest that this leaf is an important \"harm reduction\" tool.  I have been sober for more than a year and a half, without a sip of alcohol.  In that same timeframe, I have used kratom a handful of times.  I had not tied the two together until reading references in news stories this fall.  However, kratom is certainly a relatively risk- and harm-free way to achieve a minor sense of well-being and relaxation (nothing that could be appropriately described as a \"high,\" in my experience) for those of us for whom alcohol is not an option.\n\nI would urge the DEA to reverse course entirely and leave kratom unregulated, just as a similar herb, kava, is treated.  Kratom has always been an esoteric substance known and used by a tiny portion of the population, particularly chronic pain sufferers .  It poses no public health threat, just as kava has not created any public ills since the DEA wisely decided not to schedule that substance in the 1990s.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3512","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"timothy litzenburg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Using Kratom in low doses gives me energy and helps with my back pain.

I have been using Kratom for approximately 2 years I do not believe that Kratom should be a schedule 1 controlled substance. The tea in its natural state is safe. It has helped me with pain, anxiety, energy and depression. It helps me be able to get up and go to work, whether it is when I work in the field or at the office. I work in construction and am in pain a lot of the time, Kratom helps me tolerate the pain, while helping me focus with a healthy amount of energy. I also have asthma and have had issues with taking opiate based prescription medicine causing shallow breathing and respiratory depression. Kratom has never caused any complications with my asthma or breathing. Prior to discovering Kratom, I dealt with extreme anxiety and depression, so bad I was taking up to 4 mg of alprazolam a day alongside 2 mg of clonazepam and had tried several antidepressants such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Paxil, and Trazodone, all of which caused me horrible side effects that made my depression and anxiety much worse. Kratom has allowed me not to be dependent upon benzodiazepines as much. I am no longer using alprazolam and only occasionally use 1 mg clonazepam, usually when Kratom is not available or in high anxiety situations, such as large crowds. I notice that because my anxiety is much lower, my depression has subsided significantly. I do not feel that Kratom should be scheduled, it is natural, safe and helpful for many who want alternatives to dangerous and addictive medicine and drugs. The most regulation Kratom should have is as an herbal supplement, nothing more.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14182","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Payne","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is just a plant and has the possibility to save million of lives, it needs more research before making it illegal and hurting tens of thousands of people","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17769","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"jake williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I respectfully request that you do not reschedule Kratom,  Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3156","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Elizabeth Khan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I object to the FDA's proposal to place Kratom onto Schedule I.\n\nKratom has been used safely and wisely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.  It would be foolish, from the point of public policy, to restrict it or ban it.\n\nI think that banning kratom expands the so-called \"war on drugs\", while the American public overwhelmingly supports ending this said \"war\" that has been both futile and expensive.\n\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars -- this is a bad thing as arresting folks tends to destroy their lives forever.\n\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\nAccording to scientists, side effects experienced from the use of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.  Accordingly, prohibiting kratom, as I said, is unwise as it will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19799","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Fr.
