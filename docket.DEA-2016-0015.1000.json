I have had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for most of my life because of childhood trauma. I have also had major depressive disorder, recurring because of the same profound childhood trauma. I had lost my teaching position at a community college in the spring of 2011, because the position itself had been eliminated (downsizing, if you will). I had sunk into an abnormally deep depression, which was so severe that I was plagued with suicidal ideation. While I fought this with everything I had, it seemed to be a losing battle. Kratom was recommended to my by a friend and colleague. I was told I could buy it at a local tobacco shop. I took a small dose of the kratom to see if it would help me get out of the depression. It worked instantly, and without side-effects. I had never had any luck with antidepressants, or psychotropic medications of any kind, but the kratom worked, and it worked well. In addition, I found an online business that supplied an affordable and high-quality edible kratom powdered leaf in bulk. When mixed with orange juice, this 100% organic herb did wonders to alleviate the symptoms of my depression. Once I was exhumed from my severe, debilitation, life-long depression, I found the strength to face my unemployment. Within a week, I had found temporary employment. Today, I am a full-time professor at a major university. Over the years, I have found that the only side-effect of kratom that I ever experienced is nausea that occurs only if I take too much, or if I take it too often. I consider this to be a benefit, because it keeps me from taking larger doses. Really, any medicinal herb should not be taken in large quantities. I find that a moderate dose in the evening, 2 hours after supper, is about right for controlling my symptoms, and it helps with my insomnia (the insomnia is related to my PTSD). While I am not addicted to kratom, I do find that the depression will immediately return if I stop taking kratom for an extended period of time. This is true of all psychotropic substances; the benefit will disappear if you stop taking it. Please note that this depression was a diagnosed, preexisting condition, and it is not a result of the kratom itself. I simply would not be able to function as a full-time professor if I did not have this herb to treat my depression. I do not take any other psychotropic or psychoactive substances. I don't even drink caffeine, as I find that it irritates my PTSD condition. The type of kratom that I take is called \"Green Malay\", or \"Green Vein Malaysian Kratom Leaf\". I have had no experience with other types of kratom, and I make no claims about them. I can only speach for green malay. I ask you to please not take this herb away from me. I have never broken a law in my life, and I never will. If kratom is outlawed, I will have no choice. In my mind, the law is what maintains order and structure in our society, and it must be followed even if it means returning to my depression and PTSD. There are no other alternatives that have helped with my condition. I could list the treatments I have tried over the years, but it would simply take up too much room. The kratom that I take helps with both my major depressive disorder, recurring and my post-traumatic stress disorder.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2295","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Spurgeon B S M S M Ed","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have no personal experience with kratom, however I've had close personal relationships with several longtime users.

I believe this is a hasty decision made about a benign plant which needs further medical research into it's many beneficial properties. I'd like to share my story with you.\n\nI personally use the plant as an alternative and addition to over-the-counter and prescription pain medications, as I was born needing many surgeries on my feet simply in order to walk, due to club foot. Kratom has given me a better quality of life, without the terrible toll that opiates can take. The plant has been used for thousands of years with little to no side effects. There is no logical reason to schedule kratom in such a harsh way, and this matter has given the appearance that the government and DEA don't have the best interest of US citizens in mind. The information spread in the DEA's request is blatantly incorrect and malicious.\n\nIf you have any sway in this matter, please make the case that this is an herb as innocuous as caffeine (or moreso), does NOT create a 'high' like prescription and illicit drugs, and helps millions of people worldwide deal with their pain and opiate habits.

I'm writing this in order to express my concern that the DEA is considering outlawing yet another plant that has had a positive impact in the lives of many in order to supposedly protect an irresponsible few. My experience with Kratom has been nothing short of miraculous. I have a chronic hockey injury that required neck surgery in 2010. Unfortunately, the neck surgery did not have the pain relieving result I'd hoped for. Finding the opiate narcotics prescribed for my pain to be dangerous, rampant with side effects and overtly addictive, I stopped getting those prescriptions for fear of being permanently addicted. I find that a modest use of Kratom is more effective as far as its analgesic effects vs. side effects. Kratom has allowed me to be more effective in my career, as the prescribed opiates had a decidedly negative effect on my job performance.\n\nRegardless of my personal desire for a natural analgesic, there is a larger desire that I have... and that is to live in the land of the free. Please do not put Kratom on any schedule or make it in any way illegal. This plant is only a problem for a small subset of people... people who don't want a natural answer to opiate addiction.

Again, that is ONE single death that has most likely been tied to a single user/abuser of a natural substance that actually has a number of medicinal benefits to those with medical need. \n\n Before I compare that health risk with those associated with legal pharmaceutical opioids and other drugs, I'll mention claimed health benefits: Non-narcotic pain relief has the potential of being the most widespread use to the general public. That alone deserves more research. Perhaps the most important consideration might be in the care of opiate dependent patients. Kratom has been used to help individuals break their addiction to lethal but legal hard drugs. Natural opium derived drugs and the synthetic counterparts have been useful to mankind for centuries, but the risks are considerable. The addiction rate is well documented. The death toll is staggering. A set of chemical compounds in a plant that show potential to break the cycle is absolutely worth clinical research. As a schedule one danger, much research will not happen. \n\nI suggest a rational approach of encouraging research while following reports of problems incurred. Monitoring emergency room reports of possible overdoses would log abuse issues, if a problem develops. As of yet, there appears to be no real danger to the general public. If facts and data show that a problem exists, a scheduling change would be merited at that time. Of the many who find use in the chemicals (\"drugs\") in the plant, one has abused it to the point of death. That is absolutely not worthy of a widespread restriction. Please do more research and make an informed consideration. What this writer found was easily available online. If there are considerable dangers associated with kratom, more would be available to those looking. It appears that the vast majority of kratom users are not looking for a mindless high. These people deserve medicine that helps them. \n\nThank you for taking time to read this, and I'm certainly open to being corrected, if what I'm repeating is not fact.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5369","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Steve Walters","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nThere really is no scientific or moral rationalization for regulating this substance after you've just approved OxyContin for use by children as young as 7 years of age.

I graduated high school with honors and a 4.0 as well as being an athlete in which I had scholarships for bsseball in JUCO. Then, I was the type of person that didn't like taking ibp after pitching 7 innings. I was prescribed Lortab due to a double ear infection and I ended up wanting to feel that way every day. I quickly graduated to IVing oxy contin and fentanyl and went through my first program in 2007. From 2007 up until July of 2015 I completed a a total of 6 programs, with the last one being a year long. Even after the year in that program plus 9 months I was unable to stay clean. I was unable to hold a job, keep a relationship, and be a father. Due to my addiction, I no longer have parental rights to my 7 year old son nor am I able to even speak to him. Unfortunately, I suffer from real issues such as chronic pain(due to a fractured back), sever anxiety, ADHD, and depression. I never thought I would ever be able to live a normal productive life until Kratom. Kratom relieves me of all of those i issues. Thanks to Kratom, I have became an HVAC mechanic, I'm getting married to a very successful woman April 1st, and am finally able to be a father to my 20 month old son (a great father at that). Sure I could go get prescribed medications for these issues but they all come with a euphoric feeling that I'm unable to keep myself from chasing. Kratom is by far the safest way for me to deal with my issues and there's no euphoric or high as people have. Even misinformed. I believe that all of this nonsense started due to Vivazen which did cause a \"rush\"  but also had many other things in itt such as California poppy, kava kava, etc. but Kratom in its natural form does NOT. If this ban goes through, those of us that found relief in Kratom will turn back to the drugs that will actually kill us.

It is a much lighter alternative to drinking alcohol, which is already legal and has been for years and years. Kratom does not cause anywhere near the amount of impairment that alcohol does.

I've been drinking kratom-infused beverages once or twice a week for the past year and have not noticed any withdrawal symptoms. I do not \"NEED\" more than one glass. I don't need any of it, actually, but I find that it's a lot better on my body than alcohol. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2014 and I've been told time and time again by doctors that alcohol will upset my stomach. In my own experience, I've found that it is extremely painful to drink alcohol. Kratom has no adverse effect on my stomach. I don't get a hangover from ingesting kratom like that of alcohol. The effects are extremely mild and wear off quickly. It goes without saying that kratom is effective in tapering addicts off of heroin and opiates. I've known many people to use kratom to take themselves off of detrimental drugs. To assert that kratom is as dangerous as heroin is insane. I've never seen anyone \"nod out\" on kratom.

Buhr / 27 / Attorney\n\nA clear statement of your view about opposing the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances\nIt is my view that the \"Maeng Da\" strand of kratom should not be made illegal, while strands with opioid-like properties such as Bali should be available by prescription only.\n\nWhen you started using kratom.\nApproximately 09/2016\n\nHow you came to start using kratom.\nThe worker at a \"head shop\" recommended the substance as a \"morning after\" substance (a hangover cure).\n\nHow kratom has helped you & and why you think it should remain available. Unless you are a doctor or other health expert, avoid making any medical-related claims.\nThe Maeng Da strand of kratom is pretty similar to coffee or other mild stimulants when used in small-to-medium doses.  Unlike caffeine, however, I find that when I take Maeng Da I do not experience the anxiety/jittery feeling that other anxiogenics (such as coffee) are known for.  I have had a similar experience with something known as the stem-and-vein powder, which in my experience has energy and mood-lifting effects.\n\nAny links to research or news articles that support your thoughts.\nI have done a fair amount of research on the substance and have found information supporting the idea that Maeng Da promotes energy/stimulation while the Bali strand has more of a sedative effect.  However, I have not read articles from medical experts and I think one of the best sources for credible, presumably unbiased information is the Wikipedia page:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitragyna_speciosa\n\nA concluding point.\nLike many other office workers, I often find it difficult to stay energized.  I find that the Maeng Da strand of kratom provides energy and mental clarity, while having none of the anxiogenic side effects that are common in other stimulants such as coffee, energy drinks, or adderall.  When I use caffeine, it makes me feel anxious and sometimes even worried.  I believe Maeng Da is a safe way to stay focused and positive throughout the day.\n  \nI would like to finish by making a cautionary statement in regard to the Bali strand of kratom, which I believe is dangerous and should not be available on the open market.  The Bali strand of kratom causes a strong sedative effect, and  I have experienced first-hand the feeling of \"nodding off,\" the \"wobbly\" sensation where your eyes don't want to focus, and worst of all, the inability to wake up even when a very loud alarm is right next to your head.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21001","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Christopher Buhr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom helps many people with opiate addiction and or chronic pain.

This appears to be a case of corruption where government officials who are supposed to protect the people sell out for personal profit and protect the pharmaceutical corporations' profits.  What is happening here appears to align with the evil and greed that is destroying the freedom, health,  and prosperity of this nation. For another one of the many cases of similar greed,  please see the following page:    http://blog.norml.org/2016/09/24/pharma-company-admits-opposing-marijuana-legalization-to-protect-its-corporate-profits/     I am almost 60 years old, I work an outdoor job in Montana and I suffer chronic pain in my joints and lower spine. I didn't feel it wise to go to the doctor for prescription pain killers to use while working on and around heavy equipment, but I also knew the pain levels were going to cause me to become disabled and no longer able to work. I discovered Kratom three years ago and in it found a solution that controls the pain while keeping me an alert and safe worker. I feel well, my strength has been restored and I am again able to keep up in the work place with people much younger than I am. When I first heard recently about the DEA plans to schedule Kratom in the same category as heroin, I did not believe something this crazy and ridiculous could be true. What the DEA is doing here is an aggressive insult and assault on the intelligence of US citizens.  The people's choice of Donald Trump in this recent election should have sent a clear message to the government concerning how we feel about government corruption. Apparently the DEA has not caught on yet to the evidence of how the silent majority feels. Kratom does not get me \"high\"... if anything it increases alertness. Alertness and safety are not possible for me if I am forced by the \"medical experts\" at the DEA to go on disabling prescription opiates for pain control.  I won't do it,  I am strong and I will choose to live with the pain before I will give in to the greed and corruption as I view it here.  I refuse to take prescription opiates or any drugs.  I trust natural herbs,  and no government official has the God given right to deny an herb to any human on this earth,  and to think that they do is an assault upon truth.  I also will refuse to take the kratom based drug (that is the entire motive for this proposed and corrupt ban of the herb),  which will be coming forth from Glaxo Smith Klein which is a distorted fluoride extract of the kratom herb which I doubt will be safe,  and which (after man's tampering), will have dangerous side effects. Take Valerian for example: Valerian is a safe and calming herb:   nothing could be more safe.  After being chemically tampered with, however, this safe herb is transformed into a drug called Valium.  Valium is a dangerous and addicting drug that has destroyed thousands if not millions of lives and has killed people. If \"safety of the people\" is the real issue here,  then why isn't Valium illegal?   Hello, Govt: do not tell me out of one side of your mouth that I live in a \"free\" country, while out of the other side of your mouth you are stating that as an adult, I am not intelligent enough, not able and not allowed to decide what is safe or unsafe to put into my own body. I know myself, and I know what works for my situation. The DEA is going to make the government look pretty stupid and corrupt for busting people with chronic pain for their great crimes of wanting to remain productive, working and tax paying citizens.

I have suffered many injuries through out my career and have also struggled with alcohol and opiate addiction for a long time.  My addiction got worse after the Physicians began to prescribe me oxycontin for my pain.  I noticed that it helped for a while, but was highly addictive and my tolerance for these pharmaceutical opiates skyrocketed almost immediately.  After years of treatment of my addiction and natural ways to alleviate my pain I found a natural herb known as Kratom.  I have been taking Kratom for 5 years now with low increased tolerance and little to no dependance, comparatively to the extremely powerful opiates I was prescribed in the past by my physicians.  I noticed that Kratom helps a lot more with pain and anxiety without the high.  I have seen other professionals, family and friends around me use Kratom with enormous success in these areas and more.  I believe Kratom to be a very healthy natural alternative to opiates and even find that it helps better with pain without the risk of becoming dependent on it.  I actually find it helps more with my pain then any supplement or prescription drug I have tried in the past.  I am now clean and sober for five years and off all narcotics and drugs.  I have Kratom to thank for this monumental improvement in my quality of life and well being.

Kratom, a simple herb from Indonesia, gave me a window - away from the booze/needle - to focus on myself, and my health. Not to mention created a buffer for me to taper slowly out of opiate use. If this plant was not commonly available - I would be dead. I owe it my life.\n     We live in a nation of Liberty - the right to pursue health and happiness as we see fit. This is part of that ideal. We say we are in the midst of the greatest opiate epidemic we've ever seen - this plant is a valuable tool, used by millions. We already went down this road with marijuana - and the people have spoken. We do not want to be jailed for herbs that are not dangerous. We want to treat our problems with medicines that work, and don't come from a lab who's only motive is profit. Please, do the right thing - and remember the people using this are mostly responsible - ex-LEO, ex-military, working moms in pain. \n     The CDC says: \nDrinking too much can harm your health. Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) each year in the United States from 2006  2010, shortening the lives of those who died by an average of 30 years.\nKratom has lead to 0 years of potential life lost. Kratom got me OFF the alcohol. If we aren't going to seriously talk about banning alcohol, we have NO BUSINESS banning kratom. Alcohol ruins productivity, makes people temporarily insane and unable to feel physical pain AND is tremendously physically addictive, carcinogenic ... yet adults can get/use that. Going through with a ban will confirm your bias re the pharmaceutical and legal drug industries. That isn't doing the right thing - that's protectionism of an industry that is LITERALLY a clear and present danger. Also good to note: ibuprofen/NSAIDS cause at LEAST 3000 deaths with a top estimate of 15000 yearly. THAT is available over the counter, to children and anyone. Be sensible.\n     One last thing to think of - everyone who uses Kratom heavily for pain will be in minor opiate withdrawals - if you cut them off, they WILL seek out other things - most of which are contaminated with fentanyl. They have no tolerance, and hundreds if not thousands will die. So - to date we have 6 people dead of kratom in combination with illicit drugs so that NO ONE can produce a death certificate of specific kratom toxicity OR hundreds dead trying to get pain relief.

I've been consuming Kratom for a little over a year and a half to help improve the quality of my life as I suffer from Crohn's Disease.  Crohn's Disease is an auto-immune disease that can and does cause inflammation throughout the entire digestive system. What Kratom does for me is to help alleviate some of the anxiety and depression that goes along with a flare up. It does NOT prevent flare ups and is by no means a cure for Crohn's, but it does help to improve my general outlook when these flare ups occur.  I take Kratom in conjunction with St. John's Wart to improve my overall mood during these times.  Before I discovered Kratom, when my condition would flare up, I would get so overwhelming depressed from the pain associated with intestinal inflammation that it would cripple me, physically and emotionally. Kratom has changed that for me.  It's allowed me to go about by day to day even during flare ups. Another benefit that I found is that it does help alleviate some of the pain associated with a flare up, similar to that of Tylenol.  \n\nPlacing Kratom into Schedule I is, in my opinion, an extreme measure that has no foreseeable benefit to the general population. The DEA claims that there is high potential for abuse and no medicinal value. I would argue that the same can be said for alcohol, tobacco, Caffeine, and even chocolate.  There is very little logic in this decision, and it ignores all the benefits that Kratom has shown to provide. \n\nThe DEA states that there have been over 600 calls to the Poison Control over a 5 year period, though it does not state the nature of these calls. Were they a result of actual poisoning or simply to get information? In comparison, the Poison Control received 6,843 child poisoning calls for laundry detergent pods in a seven month period(www.aapcc.org/alerts/laundry-detergent-packets). \n\nThe DEA initially sited 15 deaths attributed to Kratom, however since that time the have retracted that number to one death.  In comparison, According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, alcohol causes about 88,000 deaths a year in this country(www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0293.htm#table1_down), while 28,000 deaths were attributed to heroin and opioid painkillers in 2014(https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/). Kratom looks pretty benign by comparison.\n\nIn conclusion, the DEA's decision to place Kratom into Schedule I is extremely short sited is is not based on factual or scientific information, but rather a lack of understand of what Kratom is and actually does. I would advocate for further government funded research into the benefits of Kratom, while keeping it open to use for those who have benefited from it. Thank you for your time and for your service. \n\nSincerely, \n\nRyan Leighton","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5219","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Leighton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Simply put, Kratom shouldn't be banned.

I also personally have chronic pain from herniated Discs which was only getting worse and worse on standard pain Meds. When I asked for non-narcotic alternatives, my numerous doctors trialed me on things that gave me awful side effects and/or did almost nothing for the pain. Side effects including but not limited to, temporary paralysis, hallucinations, dissasociatiive episodes, narcolepsy, or sleeping for days at a time. The only thing that would give me relief was opiate medication...but that was giving me less and less relief as my tolerance went up. And the side effect of that aside from gastrointestinal blockage, is one of the most dangerous ones there is, addiction. I did not want to travel the route I had seen others go before me. With Kratom I was able to break the chain and get through physical therapy without collapsing in tears. I was able to take back power in my life and be able to function again, and without a painful addiction and questioning whether it was making my rebound pain worse. I never felt like I was intoxicated from this plant derived supplememt. I was clear headed and able to work. I no longer take it regularly, but I do for flare ups, and it is far better than taking an opitae derived pain killer because the next day I do not feel like I need more to keep the pain away the way that narcitics have a rebound effect. Removing this drug from public use will undoubtedly cause an increase in addiction problems as people desperately search for other ways to stifle their pain and try to function. I've also known it to help people with addiction problems who do not have pain. It would be a shame to remove this option for so many people who just want to live a normal life.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4347","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I think Kratom should s?t?ay legal.\n \nI oppose any law that prohibits responsible adults from being able to ?freely ?buy or take Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21958","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please dont make Kratom illegal .I use it for chronic pain.

I couldn't image you classifying it as anything other then herbal supplement or herbal remedy. Maybe even something that regularly belongs in a relaxing tea to help sooth muscles or aid in sleep. I personally have taken it off and on over the course of four years. Usually for my anxiety because it almost stops my feeling of unease of social anxiety as well as helps with the constant pain of having nerve damage. Ive taken it for tooth pain and to relax when I have insomnia, but at no time do I think you should make this product that monks and workers throughout 1000s of years in asia have been using perfectly safely. Are we not responsible enough as the average worker/monk from years before our time period? It is not a harmful product, making it illegal in any format will only bring about the pain to people looking for alternative \"green\" medication instead of damaging pills. Lower class people looking for relief from problems they cannot begin to afford will also be hurt.

It's simply not a drug that can affect the user in a way comparable to any of the schedule 1 drugs.\n\nEvery one of my experiences with kratom have been positive.

I'm 33 years old, and I've had chronic spinal issues for 13 years. Over the past decade, my doctors have prescribed any number of narcotics to \"manage\" my pain. I have taken so much hydrocodone over the years, and nearly became addicted. My tolerance for opioids and muscle relaxants was very high because of this, which caused my doctors to prescribe even stronger medications. Thankfully, after doing extensive research on holistic ways to manage chronic pain, I found kratom. With the help of kratom and physical therapy, my pain has decreased significantly and my life has become much better. I'm not sure if you know how damaging chronic pain can be to your whole body and mind. Living in pain day-in, day-out causes your life to erode and wilt. You stop wanting to move, for fear of a flare up. Your brain gets conditioned to expect pain and suffering every day, which leads to depression. My family, my career, and my mental wellness were all greatly affected by my chronic pain. Kratom has been a godsend to me; It has taught me how to enjoy life again, and realize that I can live without the constant fear of pain. Please consider the life-altering ramifications of banning kratom, and the millions of Americans it will harm. More research needs to be done on kratom, and that will be nearly impossible should it become a schedule 1 drug. Our healthcare system is set up to get people addicted to drugs, and then blame them for their addiction. How could we ban a holistic and safe drug while permitting doctors to prescribe lethal amounts of ACTUAL narcotics? Banning kratom will have devastating effects on individuals who have used kratom to week off of narcotics. There have been 0 deaths DIRECTLY attributed to kratom alone. If your concern is for public safety, you should ban alcohol and cigarettes, as they have DIRECTLY caused the death of millions of Americans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15912","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Foster","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Kellyn Gray and I live in Georgetown, Texas.

I am not an uninformed young long haired doper. I am a 61 year old businessman, a biochemist with several patents.  \n\nTwenty years ago I shattered my ankle after falling 40 foot in a hiking accident.  Four surgeries later I lived for years on a constant regiment of 4-8 # 4 codiene/Tylenol, and up to 2 grams of ibuprofen a day.  It was destroying my liver, causing gall stones, constipating me, interfering with my mental capacities, and over time losing its effectiveness in managing my constant pain. Because synthetic opiates such as demerol are not effective for me, my doctors solution was to suggest morphine. This had to change. \n\nHaving also studied ethno-botany at Cal State Northridge in the 70's I decided to investigate herbal and nutritional treatments for pain and inflammation. After studying the liturature extensively I found many potential alternatives for pain management and inflammation. I tried many plants and combinations, Kratom was the most effective for pain management. I found that kratom was very effective at controlling pain (more effective than codeine), eased my withdrawal from the opiates, did not interfere with my mental capacities (did not get me high), had none of the side effects, and was not addicting.\n\nAfter a year of daily kraton treatment I was able to exercise my ankle to the point I went from 5% range of motion to 15-20%.  After two years I was able to reduce my use of kraton so now I only take it for two or three days when my pain flares up (usually then the weather is changing, or if I have had to stand on concrete for extensive periods.) I may use it a couple times a month and sometimes go months without needing it. I never had ANY withdrawal symptoms. I have never had cravings.\n\nKraton is a safe, effective natural substance and alternative to the opioid epidemic that is sweeping America today.  Its availability as a home remedy should not be interfered with. Banning it makes as much sense as banning chamomile tea, or steaming eucalyptus leaves because toxic chemicals can be extracted and concentrated from them which would be dangerous in high enough doses.\n\nAs a scientist who has studied the literature and experimented personally, I want to state for the record that the desire to ban kraton by classifying its component alkaloids as a class 1 substance is NOT based on science or on a public health crisis.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5751","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Diggins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly encourage the DEA to pursue a science-based, freemom-first approach to drug policy in America. From the inclusion of cannabis in Schedule I drugs (along with heroin) to the recent flip-flop on the scheduling of Kratom, the DEA has shown its inability to make smart, informed decisions on the natures of psychoactive chemicals in our society. The three main drugs in America are tobacco, alcohol and caffeine (found in high concentrations in coffee, and markedly less so in tea). All of these drugs pose a high risk of addiction, dependency and death if over-consumed. Yet, these are the most accepted drugs in American society today. DEA policy ignores basic science on drugs and claims drugs like kratom and cannabis have no place in society due to their extreme danger and lack of medical benefits. Yet, this is simply not true. The Dea ignores the fact that alcohol acts on neurotransmitter receptors in the brainstem, critical for life-sustaining functions like heartbeat and respiratory function and this is remarkably capable of ending human life at relatively low doses. Cannabis and Kratom on the other hand are, profoundly so, drugs that act on cortical brain regions, and thus are incapable in the traditional way of ending someone's life, in the way that alcohol and heroin can.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0273","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Schramm","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I strongly oppose the placement of kratom on the DEA's list of schedule 1 controlled substances.

I'm age 31 have two kids and I'm disabled with bipolar 1 disorder and ptsd. I found kratom 1 year ago while searching the internet for possible alternatives to the pain and anti anxiety medications I was taking which were highly addictive but seemed to be the only thing that worked at aleviating my anxiety and pain. What I stumbled upon was kratom. At first I just thought it was another gimmick and I almost disregarded but when I researched a little more I found consistent posts stating that kratom really was a great alternative to pain and anxiety mediactions altogether and was effective at easing withdrawals for a person deciding to kick an opiate habit minimising the pain. I decided to drive to the closest store selling the product and soon tried it. I was amazed at how well kratom worked without taking the slight euphoria too far. What I mean is that I dI'd experience a slight buzz but not so much that I could have considered myself high. I like the fact that it doesn't cross the thresh hold between intoxicated and an elevated moon. Kratom is nothing like heroin and high powered pain medications in many ways. Withdrawals can be compared with missing a cup of coffee in the morning and are absolutely nothing worse than a night out drinking alcohol which I'd say alcohol  is ten times worse than kratom. I take kratom on a daily basis and because I take kratom I don't do drugs, drink alcohol, or even experience the symptoms of my mental illness as severely. PLEASE KEEP KRATOM LEGAL. I would like to not have to resort back to Zanax or anything like that.

I also take Kratom to help with my Fibromyalgia, so that I can continue to lead an independent, productive and benevolent lifestyle.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, Fibromyalgia, a chronic, debilitating pain condition, began stealing my life from me.  While I once worked 50+ hours a week, making an annual income of $50,000 and led an outgoing, active lifestyle, Fibromyalgia gradually reduced me to a \"shell\" of my former self, mentally and physically.  I eventually had to quit work, spent all of my financial assets to survive, and almost lost my home. From day to day I literally never knew if I could get out of bed.  Just going to the grocery store took the effort of running a marathon. I couldn't imagine spending the next 10, 20, 30 years in such misery.  \n\nI was near seeking governmental disability financial assistance when I found Kratom a little over a year ago.  That discovery started my ascent back to a life of functioning and actually enjoying life.  I am now working 20-25 hours a week, have re-energized my volunteer efforts, and I feel \"normal\" much of the time.

I am back to being the person I was meant to be.  \n\nAt the end of the day, dont we ALL just want to be happy and productive, and live our lives relatively free from pain?

I have dealt with many many side effects, most of them very unpleasant and sometimes worse than my diagnosis. This past year I was introduced to Kratom, I did my research before taking this herb. Decided it was not that harmful and my risk of side effects minimal. For the first time in my life I am living life! No more waking up feeling nauseated, jittery or hot sweats! My anxiety and depression have diminished a lot and I feel like myself and more productive. I have been trying for the past several years to wean myself off of cymbalta due to it affecting my liver. My doctor for several years has been against me getting off cymbalta despite what it is doing to my health. I having been using Kratom along with my cymbalta while weaning off the cymbalta, and I am now cymbalta free! I have not had any drug withdrawals from the cymbalta like I have had in the past, like head zaps, severe nervousness and feeling paranoid! Cymbalta should be Banned not Kratom! The doctors don't tell you that if you want to get off the drug after 14 years of taking it that it will be almost near impossible to bear the withdraw symptoms! I know several people in my community now who take Kratom and it has given their lives back to them! It makes no sense to me at all that the DEA wants to ban it and make it illegal! They should not have the say on how to dictate people's lives and their health. No one should. Our so called government should not have the power to ban a plant that is part of the earth that we all share.

I am grateful the Lord led me to it. In revelation 22:2 (niv) it says the leaves of the tree is for the healing of the nation's. And we are grateful for the blessings God has bestowed upon our lives. Until I took this medicine I could never truly manage my life and I have been managing my life to the fullest since starting kratom. I was hit by a drunk driver at 4 years old crossing the road as I walked and have been in 3 car accidents also. I have 4 bulging discs and had bone spurs until God started my healing process. The pharmaceuticals truly hurt my body for 7 years and I was dieing in the flesh and the Lord rescued me and brought me to salvation thru Christ. I am truly grateful and I have learned of the flesh and the things of the flesh. I believe as I was confused and as Jesus said on the cross Father forgive them for they know not what they do, that people are fearful and confused over kratom and it's potential for good or bad. As other things of this earth are not handled proper and thru prayer so can kratom be misused or misunderstood but clearly the testomonies will show the value of what our creator has given us and we need disipline in all areas of the law to be able to fulfill the law and not break the law unto righteousness. I am not against the law and the law of the spirit which gives life sets us aside from the law of sin and death so that which the law can be fulfilled that states we should honour God in all we do and live good and clean Godly lives in Godliness. As the Word is searched the truth will be revealed onto us showing the truth and why the trying process of condemning this medicine is being done and to show u that if true research of the Holy word and surrender to prayer and devotion unto right motives will show more lives can be saved than the product condemned and many lives hindered and all together lost due to lack of knowledge. Mercy and grace shall show to stand firm in the fact that even If condemned under the law righteousness will not be fulfilled though the motive still stands unclear as the Congress and dea can not agree as to the purpose and certainty of this move is to be made clear to themselves and the public that it neither know right and wrong now has clear right standing in the law unto themselves. Thank u and please take into account God's word shows the same as the condemnation of Marijuana never stood the test of time neither will kratom because it is unto lack of knowledge these things under the law are pursued and those things lack ability to truly uncover truth as to knowledge and deliverance for the people stand to be done in rightouseness if we surrender and teach though not to condemn but to deliver and save. Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are the poor in spirit and they shall be comforted. Beattudes is where many lie in hope and waiting as do I. As the earth suffers this medicine shall deliver the suffering of many as they lie in wait thru prayer to receive helping and deliverance from the pain and suffering of the things of this earth including the sorcery of the many drugs out there. This is clearly efficient. I spent 7 years on hydrocodone , oxycodone and suboxone all the while my body lie in waste and here with kratom I become alive again to see the law condemn it without knowledge, which is nessesary to be of true justice does not suffice in the eyes of the Lord. May salvation be with u in the midst of tribulation as America sees a new light over the next five years to break their sin and turn them from their wickedness  yet not to condemn but to save. Have that as ur motives and have salvation for the truth to be delivered unto the public. Let the reader understand.

I have suffered with chronic pain, fatigue, migraines, depression and anxiety for 40 years. I have PTSD and panic attacks as a result of dealing with my daughter's life-threatening disease for the past 8 years. Kratom has helped me cope with these issues and I am staunchly opposed to its scheduling, at any level.\n\nAt 14, I began using alcohol and drugs to cope with anxiety and depression. My use of these substances lasted for 18 years and had expectedly negative consequences. I am lucky to have survived those years. I never wanted to have children if it would mean having them see their mother under the influence of alcohol or drugs so I quit cold turkey on October 23, 1993 and have never used since.  \n\nSoon after, I had my first child. The chronic fatigue, pain and debilitating migraines (from what would later be diagnosed as fibromyalgia) made it hard to be the kind of mom I wanted to be. I averaged 60 days a year lost to this illness, days where I could not get up and my toddler would have to call my husband home from work. \n\nI spent the next 20 years desperately trying to find something that would help me with my symptoms, but had little luck. Prescription drugs made me feel sicker and were not safe for me to be taking while I was driving or caring for my children. The depression and guilt from being in bed was overwhelming. Getting through each day was exhausting. As my children got older I realized they too were exhibiting the same symptoms and my search for a safe treatment was even more important.\n\nThen I learned about kratom on the internet. I had tried so many things over the years, that it was hard for me to get my hopes up. But because of the testimonies of hundreds of people, I decided to try it and the results surprised me. Within 30 minutes of consuming kratom, I actually felt good!  Not drugged, not high, not impaired in any way. Just pain-free!  Anyone who has suffered from chronic pain knows that feeling 'normal' is the best feeling you could ever ask for!  And the fact that a natural supplement can provide this is very important to me. \n\nKratom is not a cure for my illness, there is no known cure. What it is, is something that takes away my pain, safely, naturally and affordably. It is something that helps me to be productive. It is something that allows me to focus on the things I need to be doing to improve my health, like exercising, preparing healthy meals, getting enough sleep.  In addition to the pain relief, it also has helped tremendously with my depression and anxiety. It is the first thing that has ever worked like this, without negative side-effects. I have never had any withdrawal symptoms. If I don't have kratom on a given day, my symptoms simply return as before.\n\nTo wake up one morning and find out that this plant, which I enjoy as a relaxing tea, could now be a Schedule 1 substance, is devastating!  Especially after so many years of searching for relief. The very thought that I could go to prison for treating my pain with a completely safe and natural plant is mind-boggling. It would make more sense to schedule coffee, something that I do have side-effects from when consumed!  \n\nAs the past few months have gone by, I have seen hundreds of stories shared by others whose lives have been improved by kratom, and I am deeply saddened and completely ashamed that my government would ban this plant!  I am so scared for those who will return to prescription opiates or heroin. I have talked with people who would rather end their lives than return to those days of addiction. I am terrified to wake up one day to find out that they are gone because the help they had found was taken away from them.\n\nOur government needs to listen to the thousands of people telling their stories of how kratom has changed their lives. They need to listen to the voices of the people who are telling them they do not want the criminalization of a safe herbal supplement.  We must not take disabled vets, cancer patients, moms, dads, grandparents, college students, and prescription opiate and heroin addicts that are finally turning their lives around, and turn them into criminals. Consuming a plant, rather than taking a synthetic pill, is something we should all have the freedom to choose.  Additional benefits of this plant may only be discovered if it remains legal and completely accessible. If the DEA truly cares about getting people off of dangerous drugs and back to productive lives, they will reconsider this decision and leave kratom legal as it should be.\n\nThank you for taking the time to review and consider my personal story.  I hope you will come to realize what the rest of us have experienced to be true in regards to this safe member of the coffee plant family.\n\nJulie Thalman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3499","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Julie Thalman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, my name is Catherine Craig. I am a 26 year caregiver and a mother of two year old twins. I am writing today to express my opposition to the proposal to classify kratom as a Schedule I Narcotic. I have been an almost daily user of kratom for almost a year to help control my chronic pain. In 2015, I had a full hysterectomy for the painful disease of endometriosis. It was supposed to end my pain and give me quality of life back. Instead it resulted in two more emergency surgeries to control bleeding. The amount of surgeries I had in such a short period has affected my healing and now I am living with painful scar tissue in my abdominal area. Now I am in living in constant pain, many days are as bad or worse than before my surgeries. I realized about a month after my surgeries that I didn't have options for pain management. Physical therapy barely helped, the narcotic medicine that I was given immediately after my surgery was only a short-term solution, and no pain clinics will take me because of my condition. It was after I started to research natural alternatives that I came across kratom. I learned that Kratom is a completely natural substance; it is a tree indigenous to southeast asia that has been used traditionally for centuries, and most of it comes into the country in powdered leaf form. I read testimony after testimony and thought that this plant was too good to be true. But I had no other options, so I ordered some. Within 15 minutes of ingesting a small dose of the powdered leaf, my pain was nearly gone. Instead of struggling to do the simplest tasks like make bottles or change diapers, I was rolling around, laughing, and playing with my kids on the floor. I also noticed that I didn't have the fog or feeling of intoxication that came from narcotic pain medicine. I was clear headed and nearly pain free, and almost in tears with that realization. The days that I don't take kratom, I don't have withdrawal as I would if I was taking narcotic pain medicine and suddenly stopped.\n\nI am depending on this safe, natural, plant, to live a quality life. If I am not longer able to use kratom to combat my pain, I will no longer be able to hold a position that fits my skillset or experience. I will have difficulty finding and keeping work, which will lead to financial hardship and potential loss of housing.

For 17 years I have been dealing with an autoimmune disease that causes crippling pain at its worse, and fatigue and aches at its best. Pain medication such as opiates help to a certain extent, but not enough to go through the hassle of an appointment every month, not enough to risk addiction, and not enough to jeopardize my career.  When I started using kratom I noticed an immediate reduction in pain (pharmaceutical companies hate that something they make doesn't help...but a legal product does....hmmmm...yeah you know what I'm hinting at). That reduction in pain helped me to focus more on my education and my career, focus more on going out for family activities without worrying if my chest pain or back pain would come back and ruin it all. With kratom there have been days where I forget I'm sick, forget that I even have chronic pain. I never once felt the need to abuse it, never felt euphoric, and never ever have I had a craving for it. \n\nWhen I see a story saying someone died on kratom, it's always followed by more info saying the person was drinking or popping pills...basically being stupid. In literally EVERY drug class there are some abusers who many don't actually need it for pain, or anxiety, or fatigue. Yet how many people abuse legal and regulated pharmaceuticals? How many die each year from opiate prescription overdose? How many people die from alcohol? Or from mixing all the above? \n\nI beg you to please not ban kratom. So many people rely on it to rid them of pain, fatigue, depression etc. I myself might have given up a couple years ago, but I didn't, because kratom has helped me to push through the pain and fatigue when I need to.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9611","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kimberly M.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Over the last few years I've become close friends with a lot of folks who use kratom for various reasons.

I think it is incomprehensible that this herb would be scheduled at all. Please do NOT schedule this herb as a schedule 1 drug.  \nIt is not a drug at all. It is an herb that is beneficial to so many people in so many ways and for the DEA to do anything to hinder its availability to consumers, I feel would be detrimental.\n\nFor my personal situation... I am 50 years old and have several auto immune conditions. I work full time managing two restaurants, and a typical day requires a minimum of 10 hours of standing, walking, and various physical activities, all while engaging with customers. A couple of the conditions are easily controlled and do not interfere with these activities. However, I have TWO types of arthritis - osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis that originally manifested itself as juvenile arthritis when I was a child.   A while back, I began taking licorice root, as well as a few other herbs to control inflammation, and this helped me reduce the amount of NSAIDS and Cox 2 inhibitors that I have to take, and this was great because both of those medications can be detrimental to an intestinal issue I have and I had to take ADDITIONAL medications for my stomach to tolerate the OTHER medications.\nI also had to take Tramadol for the pain, and as time went on and as the long days wore on, the dosage had to be increased. \nI had several concerns about this.  I discussed stronger pain medications with my doctor, but I really did not want to move in that direction.  Fifty years old is not young, but the average white female has a life span of 81.2 years, and arthritis is not going anywhere any time soon. I could conceivably have over 31 MORE YEARS  of increasing pain medications to manage my conditions, and I have no desire to become part of the opioid epidemic.      \nI researched and tried multiple herbs without much success until I tried kratom. I found kratom was incredibly helpful in controlling and reducing my pain throughout the day, and on most days I don't feel I need pain medications to complete my tasks. Kratom and reduced pain has the additional benefit of giving me the energy to get through the day without interfering with cognition in any way. \nIt was a relief when the emergency ban was halted and I appreciate the opportunity to offer my opinion on the availability of kratom.\nPlease do NOT schedule kratom.  It is an amazing herb with the potential to help so many people. \nThanks so much for considering my input.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5441","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Donna Brinkman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whomever this may concern. I want to say this herb is saving my life and my family. I'm a recovering heroin addict and pain pills addict. Let's be totally honest I would take any opiate to get high or just not be sick. I used to think I had my addiction under control and that I wasn't like the others the true junkies. I was in for a real shock because in fact I was just like all the other addicts. I thought I had it under control because I'd get high go to work and pay my bills and get things done. I had been hiding the fact that I was using heroin to everyone around me. I would sneak off to go get high and think that everything was just fine. I'd keep as many pills around as I could for the times I couldn't get any junk so I wouldn't get sick. I never realized until it was too late that I didn't have this under control that in fact I was in a vicious downward spiral. Everyone except me could see something was wrong they just didn't know what was wrong at the time. I kept on lying all the way up until it all collapsed around me. My wife took my kids and left me and my friends were all upset and didn't want to talk to me. That's when I came clean about my heroin abuse and tried to quit the first time. I tried to just quit cold turkey and let me tell that was brutal so very brutal. I was sick all the time and angry at the world. I couldn't function without being high anymore. I was freaking out like my world was coming to an end. All I wanted was to not be sick any more. So I took a hydrocodone one day because I was in so much pain it was unreal and I felt great. It was wonderful I wasn't sick I didn't hurting I didn't have the crazy thoughts or shakes or nothing. Then I said to myself hey I can do these and feel good but not have to do the h. I thought it was a great idea and didn't feel I had to hide it from anyone. So I got high again but on pills this time and sine it was pills and not the junk and I wasn't using a needle and not hiding it I thought everything was fine again. I was wrong everything wasn't fine. I just kept doing more and more started with just hydros or vicodin at low doses then started doing more and more. Then I found perckocet then moved on to oxycodone. I loved the oxy maybe more than the heroin. I was doing more and more and more to get high. I would do a lot in just one sitting just to get that rush by this point I was snorting them. I kept this up for a few years thinking I'm so brilliant that I found a way to stay high that's not bad for me and not causing all the problems I had with heroin. I was lying to myself again. Everything was not OK I was still getting high. I figured that out when my wife told me there's a problem after she realized I buying drugs instead of paying bills. Then she threatened to leave me again. So I started trying to quit using again. I was on day four some of the worst brutal withdrawals I've ever had and started looking for some way to get high. That's when a friend told me about kratom. I went and found some and took the dose my friend recommended. It was amazing how it worked it didn't take away all the symptoms of the withdrawals but I felt much better. I didn't have the cramps and diarrhea. I wasn't feeling lost and depressed and I wasn't so stupid high I couldn't function. I felt like I might have found help getting of the stuff with this natural herb. Then right after I found it there was a ban placed on it. I was shocked like damn I just found something to help me and there taking it away. I felt lost and ran right back for some pills. Now I hear the ban has been temporary lifted and that it's underconsideration to not ban. I for one am in favor of not banning this herb because I am great full for the help it started to give me and would like to pursue more of it in help with my path to sobriety. I hear stories all the time of how it's helped people and honestly feel it could help me. So please do take this life changing herb from those of us who could really use it to get free and clean.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16491","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"john mcjunkins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern ,\n\nI just want to express how Kratom has benifited my life and wellbeing \nI have cronic back pain and arthritis in my neck which bothers my daily activities and my sleeping in turn effects me and everyone around me on a daily basis.\nI've been on norcos for 6+ years just to control my pain enough to get along and work .\nI've been tired and sick of taking them for a long time now.

I am writing in regard to Docket No. DEA-442W which concerns the scheduling of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two alkaloids of the plant kratom, under the Controlled Substances Act. I would like to voice my strong opposition to the scheduling of kratom's alkaloids which would effectively ban kratom in the United States.\n     Ground kratom leaves prepared as herbal tea have become an important supplement in my daily routine over the past two years after a prescription antibiotic left me in severe pain and with lasting joint and tendon damage, among other issues. Kratom, along with my other supplements, has helped improve my mobility and quality of life.I have had periods of time in which I refrain from drinking kratom tea, when traveling for example, and suffered no ill effects or withdrawal symptoms. Based on my two years of personal experience kratom has proven to be a safe supplement with no major side effects and very low risk of dependency. Since implementing kratom tea into my regimen I have not experienced any negative changes in my overall health, and if I remove kratom from my routine the only negative effect is that my tendon and joint pain become apparent again. I am grateful to have this herb as an option to help manage my symptoms and I strongly feel that as a responsible adult I should continue to have this option for myself. \n     Kratom helps many like me, but it has also been shown to be an effective and safe means for those who are suffering from opioid dependency and addiction. There has been bipartisan support to halt the scheduling of kratom for this very reason. Representative Brad Wenstrup of Ohio's Disctrict 2 wrote to me that kratom can be a useful harm reduction tool in the fight against opiate addiction that plagues my state and so many others. Heroin use is at epidemic proportions and so many addicts began as pain patients receiving prescription opiates. If others were aware of the non-opioid option of managing chronic pain symptoms with kratom there would be fewer people becoming addicted to prescription drugs in the first place. Edward Boyer, professor of emergency medicine and director of medical toxicology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, spoke to Scientific American magazine about a patient who consumed kratom tea daily. Boyer stated about the patient, \"After his stay at Mass General, he went off kratom cold turkey. The fascinating thing is that his only withdrawal symptom was a runny nose. As for his opioid withdrawal, we learned that kratom blunts that process...awfully well.\" \n     The studies on kratom's alkaloids are few but very promising. University of Mississippi's School of Pharmacy faculty member Christopher R. McCurdy and his colleagues found in research on lab rats that mitragyna speciosa prevented the animals from self-administering cocaine when given the opportunity. The researchers also observed that rats who had been accustomed to morphine did not suffer typical withdrawal symptoms after stopping morphine and being administered kratom. This important research validates the anecdotal evidence of the many testimonies from former addicts who have found relief in kratom and have been able to go back to productive lives. \n     Leaves of the mitragyna speciosa tree have been safely used in Southeast Asia for centuries, and in the United States for at least two decades. The deaths in recent years that have been attributed to kratom are misleading because each case when examined closer involved a poly-pharmacologic mixture of chemicals known to cause fatality and there is no reason to assume kratom, of all of those found, was the cause of death. For sake of debate, if we take the number of deaths attributed to kratom at face value we see that 15 deaths over a span of years is a remarkable safety profile for any consumable product. Let's compare those numbers to other everyday \"safe\" products. According to FDA data, over-the-counter analgesic acetaminophen is associated with deaths even at recommended dosing and is responsible for 213 deaths one year. In the same year data shows NSAIDS tallying up 3,443 deaths in the same year. As of 2014 there have been 34 deaths from energy drinks. This proves that kratom is indeed not an imminent public heath crisis.\n     Please consider this information and keep kratom unscheduled and available for responsible adults. Scheduling will result in suffering by the many people whose pain is made manageable by kratom, and those who have found a path out of addiction with kratom. Scheduling kratom will stifle research on the plant which has shown so much promise in the fight against our opioid epidemic. Scheduling kratom will have untold economic effects. Besides directly affecting thousands of kratom vendors and their employees, but what will become of the thousands more who credit kratom with allowing them to go back to work? Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5370","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Jonsson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom legal in the USA.

Eventually I learned about kratom and after one week of taking a very low dose of this plant with zero side effects,  I was able to get off opiates all together. I now use it very sparingly once a week or less to deal with my severe pain. If it wasn't for kratom i would still be buying pain killers on the street, harming my body and mind while risking criminal prosecution. Please allow this miraculous medicine to stay legal, so many people benefit from its effects, it is very safe and the research that can be done with its compounds will give rise to new pharmaceuticals that will help thousands.

The medications thrown at me were useless and did nothing but make me a zombie. I was unable to work some days because of the negative side-effects of these medications. I am big into organic and all natural foods and products and knew there had to be something else out there.\n\nI found Kratom and did a lot of research. Hours, really. I wasn't just going to put anything in my body until I was 100% confident of what it entailed. Kratom changed my life. On top of my mental stresses, I also suffer from debilitating migraines. Migraines in which I have been prescribed pain killers to help fight...I have been able to reduce, if not, eliminate pain killers now that I have the supplement of Kratom. It pains me to know that it's statements like these, will be seen more as a negative for big pharm companies over the sheer thought of losing money in the pain killer industry more than a positive statement that involves the well-being of the people in this country. \n\nKratom needs to stay available - to me, it is no different than herbal supplements that you find at GNC, or anywhere else. Damiana, for example, is another leaf-based plant that is used for anxiety, even pain. Found at GNC, online, etc. Kratom should not at any point need federal or state regulation. It has been around for nearly a hundred years, used in many different countries (and still is) - and it has no reason to be monitored or regulated by anyone but the people who farm and sell it. This is not a new product, it's just new to the wrong people/companies- the people who don't want to see a product like this being popular. By making more of  a scene, Kratom is getting more attention. The product should have been left alone and it should continue to be left alone - it has helped so many people come off of pain killer addictions and so many people get their lives back. That is not up to the government to take away. I'm from New Hampshire, where it's live free or die - I choose to live free. \n\nDon't fix what's not broken.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1007","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The War on Drugs has had a catastrophic impact on the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

Be agents of change, in a positive way.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12077","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erin Tobin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With the epidemic of prescription opiate addiction and the growing mistrust of the big pharmacy companies I believe it is way to premature to out right make kratom illegal.

I am a 34 year old Mom, wife, MBA graduate and responsible Kratom consumer.  Kratom helps me better manage my sobriety from alcohol.  I cannot understand how the government can consider making Kratom a schedule 1 narcotic when people are allowed to drink alcohol every day.   Alcohol kills 88,000 people a year in this country not including the 9,967 deaths attributed to drunk driving.  Alcohol  can cause the consumer of the beverage to be violent, increases the transmissions of STDs, causes blackouts, greatly lowers inhibitions which can cause terrible decision making, and results in many health problems such as cirrhosis of the liver, and many cancers.  Alcohol is also the number one drug that teenagers use, and is the number one cause of death by drugs used by teenagers.  I know alcohol is not on trial here, nor do I think it should be unavailable for people, but it can be very dangerous, and it is directly related to me and my life, and therefore a big part of my story.  Alcohol almost killed me, and I mean that quite literally.  It not only ruined my liver (which luckily has repaired itself), but it also turned me into a person that I did not know or even want to know.  I have severe anxiety and depression.  That is what made me originally want to drink so much.  When trying to get sober and work on my anxiety, I tried many pharmaceuticals that were supposed to help with both of those problems.  WOW!!  They make you crazier then you were to begin with, or at least that is the way they worked on me. I believe each persons body makeup is different and he/she should be able to have access to many options to help with the betterment of their health and well-being.  I am now a big fan of naturally occurring substances to supplement my general well-being, and I believe we, not only as American citizens, but as humans on this earth, should be able to have access to these plants and herbs.  I feel God put these plants and herbal substances on this earth to help us, and we should be able to do so without paying a doctor or pharmaceutical company for something that grows naturally.  Also, with the health care system as it is today, many cannot afford insurance or medicine.  I am the only person who knows how a supplement or pharmaceutical works or doesnt work for me, my life, and my body. After giving up on pharmaceuticals to help with my alcohol addiction and anxiety, I looked online for something natural and safe that would not only help with these problems that were ruining my life, but also allow me to live my life with a clear head.  I found Kratom six years ago.  When I was drinking alcohol, I could not live a normal life.  I could not work, did not talk to family or friends, and just sat secluded in my room drinking and killing myself.  Since I have found Kratom, my life has greatly changed for the better.  I am married with two young children, work out every day, and I am rebuilding the parts of my life that alcohol took from me.  Kratom helps me maintain my sobriety as well as helps to reduce my anxiety and depression.  Kratom does not lower my inhibitions, or fog my head the way alcohol did.  It simply helps me feel better so I can live a healthier, happier, and more productive life.  I feel I am a good mom, wife, and productive member of society now.  I have not had any negative side effects from consuming Kratom.  Kratom does not cause psychosis, hallucinations, anger, or even dulled intellect as some have claimed.  I have had well doctor checkups and blood work, and am the best and healthiest me that I have been in my adult life. Kratom is not something that kids take (although I would not object to making it available for only 21+), or that people use to get high.  Kratom has been in America for 20 + years and many had never even heard of it prior to this proposed ban, which in itself should prove its safety profile.  It would not have been able to fly under the radar for so long if it was a dangerous herb or a legal high. The people who take Kratom are Moms, Dads, Grandmas, Grandpas, professionals, stay at home parents, educated, and productive members of society, who have found Kratom to be a good addition to the supplements they take to better their general health and well-being.  Kratoms safety profile is wonderful compared to all other readily available substances including but most defiantly not limited to, Tylenol, ibuprofen, alcohol, cigarettes, energy drinks, and caffeine.  Tylenol is in fact, the leading cause of poison control center calls in the United States each year and is responsible for 56,000 emergency room visits, and 458 deaths per year.  Cigarettes are responsible for an astounding 480,000 deaths in the US each year.  Kratom alone has not been proven to be the cause of any overdoses or deaths.  Please do not schedule this tea leaf.  We should have a say in what we can take into our bodies.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7630","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"on august 28, 2001 i fell 50-60 feet while rock climbing (that was general consensus of the 11 paramedics sent to airlift me out) at salmon creek falls in Big Sur. i was immobilized for a year and was given all sorts of painkillers etc. it all ended up becoming an oxycontin nightmare for about a decade 2003-2013 ish. i was also on medications for ptsd and a host of other problems resulting from the trauma. discovering kratom saved my life because i was getting to the end of my rope with pharmaceuticals. the effects ruin me, the withdrawals ruin me, i was really useless and felt pretty pointless/hopeless. through kratom i have been able to walk away from all of it - it does a lot more than deaden the physical pain - it also deals with mental issues. please dont make me a criminal or force me back on hardcore opiate drugs that will end up being the death of me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23171","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"owen maigret","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This propositon is asinine, and simply a vehicle to further the delusion that the DEA is a worthwhile public expense.

Below you will find my Sons and my journey from addiction to life. Please do not ban or criminalize Kratom.\nI knew in 2005-2006 that prescription drug abuse was rampant among the students in Gilford High School. My children and their friends would openly talk about it. They werent hard to come by they just took them from mom and dad's medicine cabinets. That is how it starts, right under your nose. \nSeven years ago my oldest son was working at a local pizza shop in Gilford, NH. He and his friends would work 12 hour shifts. It started out as just a way to get a little pep in your step for the long night ahead, you know a little buzz. The first time he snorted a  of Percocet he immediately vomited. But boys will be boys and they egged each other on. The second time, it hit the Sweet Spot.  Work was fun, nothing bothered him and he never had a bad day. He was emotionally numb.  But what he didnt realize was it was then he also lost himself and I lost my son. His girlfriend and soon to be mother of his children lost the love of her life. Soon his only focus was finding a way not to get sick. He couldnt keep a job because he was always taking time off or being late because he had to find a fix so he could feel normal. I cant tell you how many things have been stolen, pawned, borrowed, and lost unexpectedly. The lies and deceit, the hurt and pain for those of us who love an addict is palpable. The relationships that have been ruined, the time in jail, and the costs associated with trying to fix them, Ive lost count of. If you are a single parent with no real resources you are own your own. Rehab is expensive, Im his mom and even for me, he couldnt stop. It is so easy for people to point fingers and say things like they choose to use, and what losers they are but I can tell you that most addicts were real, good and loving people before they started using and they still are but they and their brains have been hijacked. He was lost. He welcomed his first born into this world HIGH. He spent all of their money and they lost several apartments because of his addiction. I moved them in with me and that is where I saw firsthand what Opiate sickness/withdrawals will do to someone. They lived with me for several months and as always he would appear to be getting better. A month or two would go by and you could finally start to breathe again and then there would be $20.00 missing from your purse or his sisters. Or people would come by the house looking for him because he borrowed their PlayStation and I would know he was using again. That was my life for close to seven years. He would sober up form weeks at a time but it always ended the same way.  I ended up moving to OK in 2012 because I could no longer help him and was physically and emotionally sick myself. I had to abandon my first born because I didnt have bottomless pockets to send him to a 30 day rehab and had nowhere else to turn.\nIn November 2015 he called to tell me if I couldnt get him out of there he was going to end up dead just like the other dozen or so of his friends who had overdosed.  I flew him to Oklahoma the week before Thanksgiving. I held him while he convulsed, wiped his tears as he mourned the loss of his children again, forgave him while he cursed me because I wouldnt give him the keys to my car so he could go buy smokes.  I knew better. \n I also knew that he needed something to help with the sickness so I started doing research into holistic withdrawal treatments. Thats when I stumbled upon Kratom. I read everything I could find about it. I joined a Facebook page dedicated to its use. I spent days and nights reading everything I could find, I got myself educated. \nHe was now 5 days into withdrawals.  I ordered 4 ounces of Red Vein Kratom and gave him his first dose, about two teaspoon mixed with water. He gagged and almost threw up but he managed to keep it down and within 20 minute his legs were finally still. The color returned to his face and the strained look of withdrawal was lessening its grip. I ordered more! He looked at me and started crying. He didnt have to say anything, I knew it was working. He is now 361 days clean, has a full time job, has paid off the $800.00 plane ticket that got him here and is paying his child support weekly. We can talk about his addiction now, where before it was an untouchable subject. He tells me that he no longer even thinks about heroin and that Kratom doesnt get him high, it evens him out. He also has ADD and he is able to focus  He has told me that he knows without Kratom he would have gone back to street drugs. \nI have been seeing all the negative news about Kratom and can tell you from personal experience they do not ring true for me and my son. Kratom is not the monster, Opiate addiction is. Please do not ban or make criminal the ONLY substance that is ORGANIC and works.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5279","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Leslie McCarthy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom for almost six months now. I discovered Kratom after going through a very long and drawn out process of recovering from a back injury that I sustained in 2014. The issue consisted of bulging and herniated discs. I tried addressing it with a chiropractor, epidural shots, and multiple surgeries - all of which were unsuccessful in treating my condition to where I still currently live in pain. Throughout the two plus years that I have been dealing with it, I was on an assortment of drugs from painkillers to muscle relaxers to anti-nausea medications that got rid of the side-effects of the others. The opioids I was taking - Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, and Soma all made me unable to function as a normal person. They dulled me and made me an unproductive member of the US working force. I've been unemployed since the injury because of it.\n\nHowever, since discovering Kratom I have been making great strides towards recovery and have been able to come off of all of the painkillers I was on previously. It does not get me high. I do not take it recreationally. It allows me to function as a normal person without as much pain. Without Kratom I would still be on the drugs that nearly killed my liver and made me unable to work at all. With the herbal supplement, I am almost able to look for work again but that may change if the DEA goes through with the Schedule 1. If they do, many people like me will have to turn back to the opiates that we got off of and many will be unable to continue to be taxpayers into our system. This decision has also harmed businesses, families, and loved ones. \n\nI know of several small businesses that had to close their doors due to the DEA's Scheduling announcement and may never open again. I know of families who now are now in fear of an age without Kratom because it allows their providers to be able to go to work and interact with them. And worst of all, the government will lose out on extra tax revenue generated by the regulation of the herb and will instead turn to drug companies or to the black market for even harder, more damaging substances. \n\nThe DEA's decision to Schedule 1 Kratom will have profound effects on the users, their families, businesses, and the country should they go through with it. I urge you to delay and reconsider this course of action.\n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0238","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Lowe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've never used Kratom, but I do struggle with addiction and any natural aid in that process deserves to be fully looked into.

I'm 30 years old and a professional poker player.  I first tried kratom about two years ago.  My father who has struggled with opiate addiction/dependence was looking for alternative treatments and ordered some online.  The reason I tried it was because I was infrequently using opiates for back pain that has plagued my adult life after an l4 ruptured disc (when i was 17) and the eventual surgery.  My father eventually kicked the habit and I had found a new natural pain reliever.  I don't use Kratom regularly but when looking for something to dull the aches and pains I get from time to time, it really helps.

Ever since graduating school and assuming a full-time position (an \"upright\" one, at that), I've dealt with a significant amount of back pain--significant not in its severity, but in its unrelenting presence--as well as the fatigue and stress that come with any job where your entire day is spent on your feet, often with the phone pressed between your shoulder and your ear. After several failed attempts to find something \"wrong\" with me (X-rays, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), I was starting to consider seeing a pain management specialist (and there are several in the vicinity of my work, so I was familiar with the types of treatment they offer). Still, I was hesitant, because without an official diagnosis, and an unwillingness to \"play up\" my pain level on command, I doubted they'd take me seriously. Plus, I got to see the cycle of dependency on a daily basis--patients who started out with a broken arm or some surgical procedure being prescribed short-term opioids, which gradually turns into long-term use, until they're referred to pain management where regular, around-the-clock opioids become a staple of the patient's regimen indefinitely (unless they're weaned off with an expensive prescription of suboxone, which often turns into an indefinite treatment itself). Luckily, it was right around this time that I discovered kratom. I was extremely skeptical that it would do anything, but within 30 minutes or so of consuming it for the first time, there was a mild but noticeable lift in my mood and energy, which then seemed to make the nagging pain more tolerable. After an initial period of finding the right level for me, I was able to take it at work, and get reliable relief that was just enough to enable me to smile and be engaged with our patients, even at the end of a 12 hour shift. The effects are about as noticeable as a strong cup of coffee (maybe two), but instead of being solely a nervous, jittery buzz, it provides a balanced sense of clarity and well-being. I've been taking kratom for nearly four years now, and have not had to escalate my usage to achieve the same effects. I've discussed it with my primary care physician, and he is thrilled that I've found something natural that alleviates my discomfort without putting me at the unnecessary risk associated with prescription pain killers. If a kratom ban were to go into effect, my quality of life would be significantly reduced without access to this safe, beneficial herb. Beyond that, I fear the quality of my care towards others would likewise be diminished--it's hard to be a truly good listener and problem-solver when all you can think about is how badly you want to sit down. With tobacco-related health care costs in the billions and ~480,000 deaths annually (CDC figures), I cannot understand why *this* harmless plant would be seen as posing an \"imminent threat\" to public safety. Additionally, considering the scope and severity of the current heroin/opioid epidemic, in my professional opinion it would be significantly *more* harmful to make a safe, natural alternative unavailable. I urge the decision-makers to look at the science, look at the data (not just in isolation, but as part of the bigger picture), and ask yourselves where the imminent threats to public safety TRULY lie. Thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16355","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Hutton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Don't Place Kratom as a Schedule 1 Drug.

Kratom is not intoxicating, and it has been of benefit to me by leading me away from more harmful substances that I would use to relax after a difficult work week.  I use Kratom on a Friday evening once every week or two, and I usually spend the evening playing games with my daughters, taking a local hike, or I just walk my dog.  On Sunday morning I use Kratom when my family goes to church.  I hate going to church, but I go with my wife and children.  The tedium of the church experience is unbearable, but with Kratom I am relaxed and remain in a good mood throughout the entire service.  I also occasionally use Kratom when I have experienced insomnia.  In that case Kratom is useful for providing a valuable source of moderate energy that lasts for several hours - much like coffee.  Finally, as a middle aged man who has pain in his joints from being an athlete while I was young, I use Kratom when I play basketball, as it has some analgesic properties.\n      These are the times that I use Kratom, and it has proven to be a positive force in my life.  Before I began using Kratom to relax I would drink alcohol every weekend.  I did not interact well with my family while intoxicated with alcohol, and I certainly did not go for hikes or walk my dog while drunk.  Also I would not enjoy going to church or playing basketball while drunk or high on marijuana.  Kratom is not intoxicating, and it does allow me to relax without having to turn to more dangerous substances.  My alcohol consumption has fallen from a six pack of beer every week, to a six pack of beer every four weeks.  This alone is profoundly positive in my experience.  Please do not schedule Kratom - it is not intoxicating, and it is beneficial to hundreds of thousands of people who use it. \n ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19293","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Ferrtiter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi please do not take Kratom away from people who really need it like myself.

It quickly became a coffee substitute, helping me power through my morning classes at the university without the jitters or crash of espresso.  \n\nIt wasn't long before I realized another benefit of kratom: it alleviated my severe menstrual cramps caused by endometriosis, as well as helping curb my migraines.  Both of these ailments would cause me to miss at least 2 days of work and school every month.  With kratom I still had to take it easy, but I was able to make it to class and carry out basic responsibilities rather than being stuck on the bathroom floor in agony, vomiting and fainting from the pain.  \n\nDoctors have been reluctant to prescribe narcotics to someone my age for a recurring pain condition due to the risk of addiction, so I'm stuck with NSAIDs like ibuprofen which didn't work then or now.  Kratom is literally the only thing standing between me and disability.  I have regular blood tests and physicals, and there are no signs that kratom has damaged my body in any way.  My physician is fully aware of my use of kratom and other supplements.\n\nI now have a full-time job that offers very limited sick leave and am responsible for maintaining a household with my partner.  If kratom becomes unavailable, I will have to take unpaid leave several times a month and potentially risk losing my job due to excessive absences.  Please consider the impact that banning kratom will have on working people like me.  I do not want to end up jobless and on welfare after working so hard to get where I am.  Chronic pain is a crushing burden to live with, and losing my livelihood to it would be too much to bear.  \n\nThank you for your consideration. \n\nSincerely,\n\nTangi Haines","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1134","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tangi Haines","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom. There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?\n\nAs I consider these actions by the FDA and DEA I'm forced to wonder -- WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SMOKING?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22282","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Wainwright","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom didn't help me but I know a few whom it helped tremendously.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0750","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Freedon Fighter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom for a long time on and off to help me get threw emotional and physical pain.

My degree is in public policy and I've worked in a state government department. I came across the notice of intent posted by the DEA in early September and heavily researched the medical and scientific studies about Kratom, interviewed Kratom users, applied basic policy analysis methods and reported on the issue in September. \n\nThe DEA's conclusion that Kratom is a threat to public health does not appear to be substantiated by the references provided in the notice of intent. At least, not adequately enough for the editors of this particular publication to agree that it poses a great risk to public health.\n\nI really would like to urge the DEA to reconsider scheduling Kratom and instead allow the FDA to regulate it as a dietary supplement, much like Kava Kava or similar herbal remedies. My opinion is based on interaction with the public on this issue, the assessment of benefits and risks, and the overwhelming amount of success stories I've received from those who use this herb as part of an all-natural alternative medicinal routine. \n\nThank you for allowing a public comment period. I believe this is an important issue to many people who would like to believe that the DEA is an agency that makes well-researched decisions based on science. The political culture right now is divisive, and I believe it would be in the agency's best interest, and in the public's interest, to allow the FDA to classify this as a supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1045","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rebecca Chance","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I respectfully ask you not to bend to the DEA's hasty decision to ban Kratom.  \n\nI have Lyme Disease.

A place of contentment and wellbeing, worry free and pain free.  I've had horrid periods since I was a young girl, too many trips to the er to even recount and countless pain pills to manage the unwavering pain. I was a young mother and wife and quickly found myself addictive to the pills that were so readily available to me.  After many years battling both my periods and the constant roller coaster of always needing more pills, I had enough. A new doctor put me on the depo shot and that was the ticket I needed to never need another pain pill. The withdrawal was pretty bad but I was determined to never go back to that lifestyle. Almost a year went by and while the physical symptoms had nearly all subsided, I was left with horrible depression and was completely drained of all the energy I'd always had. I was in a very dark place, hated myself and my life and was constantly trying every herb, vitamins, health food, you name it to regain my happiness and zest for life. I ran across a strange word I'd never heard of, kratom. After researching it for months I finally decided to give it a try, I was extremely skeptical. The bottle even sat on the counter for around 5 days before I took some of the herbal smelling capsules. I started with the lowest recommended dose, and within 45 min I got my life back. In almost 3 years of taking the plant I've never had to up my dose, or had any problems not taking it for days at a time. Opiates took my soul, and kratom went into the earth and brought it back to me. The devastating effects of banning kratom will lead so many back to the darkness the drugs and opiates took them to. In the last 3 years with the strength, energy, and happiness of kratom, I got my degree in medical massage therapy and opened my own thriving clinic and am now helping others with the power of healing. I owe it all to kratom. Please don't schedule kratom, it will be so unjust and detrimental to those who take to manage and maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle.

I have struggled with severe depression for many years, and kratom has proved immensely helpful in relieving my symptoms. Since I started enjoying the benefits of kratom, I have been much happier, healthier, and far more productive and engaged in life than I had ever been before. Kratom is not a substance that helps one escape from life, but rather it is one that helps one tackle life's challenges with optimism, motivation, and a clear, focused mind. Like many kratom users, I am an educated, hard-working, and law-abiding individual who is involved in my community. I am a college graduate and a returned Peace Corp volunteer, I am gainfully employed, and I am an aspiring entrepreneur. I highly value maintaining good health and practicing personal responsibility, and I am planning for my future. Kratom has helped me manage the emotional issues that had previously held me back, and it has thereby helped me to become a better person. I am merely one of countless individuals who have found relief in this special plant. It would cause me significant personal hardship if I no longer had access to it, as I have not had the same level of success with any other method of managing my symptoms, including prescription medication. I firmly believe that scheduling kratom would be a terrible mistake, which would cause far more harm than good. People all over the country have found relief in kratom from numerous physical and mental ailments and have used it to overcome the impediments imposed by their symptoms. I am proud to count myself among them. On behalf of myself, who has a considerable personal stake in the uninterrupted availability of this plant, and on behalf of all kratom users, many of whom would suffer more greatly without kratom than I would, I implore you and your colleagues to consider the profoundly negative impact that scheduling kratom will have on many thousands of American citizens. If you get to know the kratom community, you will find that it overwhelmingly consists of perfectly decent, industrious, bright, health-conscious, and responsible citizens, whose only crime is a desire to mitigate their chronic health problems. Having used kratom daily for years, I can personally attest to the fact that it does not cause health or behavioral problems. Quite the contrary. Kratom is by no means a danger to individuals or the community. The only danger lies in restricting access to something as beneficial as kratom, and for which there is simply no substitute. I thank you very much for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sean Selvig","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped my friend get off heroin, it has totally saved his life.

They helped, alright, but they are well known to be addictive and caused many unwanted side effects. I was taking a quite high dose of medication before taking kratom supplement, 3MG lorazepam / day + 2MG alprazolam /day. In 2013 I told my doctor about kratom, he was very happy with my progress and I've decided to wean myself off antidepressants. My life received a total makeover. Since kratom saved me from horrible anexiety, I was able to function once again. I stopped seeing my doctor, as I've told him I was doing very well with my daily kratom supplement.. He did not object, and was in fact happy and said he will research this supplement for himself! I take kratom every day before work, 6mg with tea, and it always gets me though the day and I no longer suffer from anexiety and unwanted side effects of drugs. Kratom is not only good for anexiety, as once I had a horrible tooth infection and needed a surgery. Doctors prescribed me painkillers which made me super nauseous and fatigued so I stopped taking them and took 2x my daily dose of kratom. I had zero pain, I was clear headed, full of energy and went back to work the next day. If kratom were a scheduled drug, I would more than likely have to go back to see my psychiatrist, get back on the old medication and suffer from unwanted side effects and dependence issues. Kratom does not cause any dependence issues issues as it is not addictive and I have stopped using it sometimes for prolonged period of time with zero side effects, just my regular anexiety.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10127","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Damien Glodzik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was addicted to Methadone for 4 years.

In the past i have used Kratom (about 6 years ago) for anxiety. It got me through a tough time and I no longer needed it.\nNow, I suffer from many different back problems, due to an old injury. I have been through multiple physical therapy- pain management, injections, 5 different medications, chiropractor/acupuncture, massage, creams, and the list goes on. I have found NOTHING that compares to the relief I achieve from Kratom. \nI remembered Kratom, and started taking it again- regularly 2 years ago. It has changed my life. I am able to live my life again, take care of my home and family, run errands, and chase after my toddler and be the best mom i can be. Before I started taking Kratom again, my family life was taking a turn for the worst. I rarely slept without meds and they rarely helped anyway. I couldn't get out of my bed in the morning. I had to take MORE prescription meds, and still couldnt really do anything. The side effects I had from everything I took were terrible. So terrible, I was angry, depressed, gained weight, anxiety- my fiance and I fought daily because he didn't know how to help, and I felt I was a burdon. \nI was depressed about everything, especially not being able to play with my baby. THAT was the hardest. Sometimes I had to call my fiance home from work because I was in so much pain I couldn't lift my baby, let alone stand any longer. I couldn't cook healthy meals, take care of the home, nothing. It was very sad, and i knew everyone was better off without me.\n Now, I have a wonderful life again. My family is happy, I am happy, and we were able to move into a new house. WE plan to be married in spring, and we have achieved so much together. \nWhen i heard Kratom would be banned- we were all upset- I was devestated. Like hearing someone died. My heart breaks to think about going back to the place I/my family was in. We are very active, always busy, going places and enjoying our lives... I can't imagine the impact I would have on my family if I was in such pain again. It would be a sad thing for sure. I'm writing this with tears in my eyes and I can only pray that Kratom will not be removed from my life.

This may be similar to most, but has so much meaning for me.   \n\n      For several years I have been nearly incapacitated by symptoms similar to IBS, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia.   Some days are good, most days are symptomatic and some I was unable to revive out of bed from such discomfort and weakness.    For years I battled without diagnosis that troubled my doctors.    \n\n      I then discovered Kratom from online blogs of people suffering similarly.   The first week I tried Kratom, I regained hope that I could once again restart my career.   Subsequently I have found that a diagnoses might be pending, but one that there is little that can be done due to the stage I am in (Adrenal failure).    \n\n      Without the use of Kratom, I would have zero chance of recovery as the doctors will prescribe medications to combat my symptoms, but they will accelerate the deterioration.   Currently on Kratom I can return to normal activity including work and martial arts exercise and even training my three kids in their sports.    Without Kratom, they will lose their father again as they did for two year prior to finding Kratom.   \n\n     I realize that you have our best interest in mind.   I realize there are substances prone to abuse and that can cost tremendously in tax payer money.   Consider my story and the low incidence attributed to Kratom.   For Kratom only users like me, there appears to be no danger, and certainly less than even prescription meds.   \n\nI thank you already for having given me a few extra months and the opportunity to share my story with you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21709","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Geffeney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make kratom a schedule 1.

First and foremost, there is not, so far as any science that I am aware of, any legitimate risk in the consumption of these substances. Even anecdotally, evidence is scant, at best, and tends to only point out the obvious, which is that substances with we consume blithely on a daily basis (something like caffeine comes to mind), are capable of far more deleterious effects (as anyone who has had too many cups of coffee too fast surely knows) and offer a far greater chance of addiction (any regular coffee drinker can readily attest to the mid-afternoon withdrawal headaches that come along inevitably when one's morning cup or cups of joe get skipped for one reason or another). If withdrawals can accompany kratom, they are so minimal as to be all but unnoticeable in my personal experience. The scheduling of kratom would therefore merely create an otherwise unnecessary need for enforcement to prevent the use of an unusually benign substance that's been consumed with no real negative outcomes by humans for thousands of years.  \n\nSecondly, there are the beneficial aspects of kratom. While I can only tend to describe them in fairly abstract terms as the effects are very mild, consuming kratom has left me, overall, which a much improved over all quality of life that Ive experienced the past two years as a consumer. MY overall mood is greatly enhanced, with both my general stress as well as my anxiety levels greatly diminished. In general, I feel an ease-of-mind I hadnt previously felt, which has been very beneficial in both my person an my professional relationships. Ive also found that I consume far less alcohol than I had been previously before discovering kratom, and while I was never anywhere close to what one would call a problem drinker, Im sure my overall health has still been improved given how much Ive cut back over the last several years.\n\nIn short, I would like to see kratom continue to be treated for what it is: a beneficial, comparatively risk-free herb. I think both consumers and the government would find that arrangement most mutually beneficial.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19259","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Melaugh","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've had chronic pain for over a decade.

Before then, I had suffered from depression and crippling anxiety which caused me to frequently pass out. I refused to take prescription antidepressants for fear of fully losing myself in a blurr of dull, dead sensation to life. I watch several family members take prescription antidepressants and lose the ability to have normal human emotions. They quit taking them and this is not what I wanted for myself either. I was on the search for something to awaken my brain's serotonin receptors, not just to glaze over the root of the problem. I found Kratom through another family member who has studied holistic and medicinal herbs her whole life. Once I began supplementing Kratom, bought from a reputable herbal supplier, my whole world opened up. I have not suffered from depression or anxiety ever since. I take two teaspoons in the morning and am great for the rest of the day. Not only has it allowed me escape the cycle of depression, it has drastically improved the pain and mood swings I have to go through every month during womanly cycles. The pain is almost nonexistent, and I no longer find myself curled up in a ball on the floor. Kratom helps me get through long tough work days, when before I'd want to give up, cry, quit. Kratom gives me an enthusiastic \"go getter\" attitude and I've accomplished goals I set out a long time ago. I have saved and saved and outright bought the land I've dreamed of owning to turn into a utopia for my family. Kratom has done nothing but improve the quality of my life. Before I was doomed to visit therapists who do not help, and constantly referred me to other doctors. I knew I could win this battle by myself, and Kratom has helped me do just that. The FDA does not own my body. This is my body. I have little faith that the FDA is unbiased and is pressured by Big Pharma. The FDA has approved hundreds of medications that have proved to be destructive to human health and incredibly addictive. I constantly see ads for settlements being made for medication after medication that have hurt or killed people. Thousands of prescription addicts have turned to the black market once they no longer can get prescriptions filled. It's such a destructive cycle people have been forced into. We all know the disease, cancer rate, and drug addiction in America is worse than ever. People are in dire need of transparency to choose the right food and medicine for themselves. I feel Americans are paying for having their lives quietly controlled into having very few choices when it concerns their own health. My body is not the property of the FDA and big pharma. Please allow people to start taking a stand for their own lives. Kratom has helped thousands of people for years without adverse effects. Kratom is not for everyone, but it is for thousands. Please leave us this choice. Please look at all the support Kratom users have put forth to stop the scheduling of Kratom in the same category as heroin and LSD. It DOES have medicinal value. Look at all the lives it has influenced that were able to stop the first emergency scheduling. This is a huge feat that so many people took to heart and succeeded. Please don't take it away from us. The US is changing before our eyes, please be a part of a positive change. Please protect Kratom and its' advocates. If Kratom becomes illegal, a rug would be pulled out from thousands of people's feet, leaving them in a dangerous rut. Keep Kratom legal; if Kratom is kept legal, it will be safe from the hands of those who would use it to illegally take advantage of the people who need help the most. We need to support the productivity Kratom has boosted within people who have been held down for so long.

Most importantly, please understand that kratom is an herbal remedy and not a drug. It's on par with Coffee, Kava Kava, Valerian Root & countless other herbal supplements that help combat anxiety, fatigue, insomnia with the difference being that Kratom can single-handedly soothe all 3 of those common factors in our daily lives. I have been using Kratom for over 4 years to help with migraines, arthritis, fatigue, to assist in the reduction of anxiety, to aid in dulling life's minor aches & pains as well as promoting a subtle sense of well-being. Within those 4 years, I was also able to lower my alcohol intake to less than (the doctor-recommended) 1 glass of red wine a day thanks to kratom (kratom does not make one drunk or high nor is it toxic to the liver unlike the 'legal' alcohol). I was also able to stop using NSAIDS (Tylenol, Ibuprofen, etc) as often for migraines as these have been proven to cause liver issues and even liver failure (unlike kratom!!). Many responsible adults rely on kratom as a mild life-enhancing herb no different from those who rely on their Coffee, Chamomile or any other herb that has been used for thousands of years without negative impact upon society. Kratom has increased my productivity which in turn has helped me become more of a productive member of society!  I run two (going on three) successful businesses of which one of them sells kratom (online). Several individuals rely on my kratom store for their economic well-being and as the business becomes more successful, I have been employing more people that make their living from this industry. Banning kratom will not only have adverse health effects on society but it will also put hundreds of thousands of people out of a job. My own income will be negatively impacted by this ban at a time when my fianc (soon-to-be-wife) and I are planning to form a family. Kratom should remain legal and available for responsible adults like myself and my fianc who live more productive lives thanks to this mild herb that has been used safely for thousands of years.  It is widely understood by the community & an ever-growing array of media outlets that kratom has received undue scrutiny by those that see kratom as a means to lose revenue or worse. This ban is absolutely not in the best interest of the public, there are over 100,000 signatures on the white house petition in less than 10 days. The people do not support this outdated and quite frankly draconian approach to an herb that has been in our society (the U.S.) for at least 10 years w/out much incident. We are relying on our lawmakers to listen and speak up for the people and we remain hopeful that you will consider a reasonable outcome to the kratom situation such as an 18+ age restriction (which we completely support).

I am now 1 and 1/2 years clean of any pain meds and feel like myself again. It has helped countless people in many different ways but what it can do for addicts is a miracle. I completely oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. You should concentrate your efforts where the real problem lies the epidemic of americans addicted to pain pills and look into what the doctors are giving them. And use kratom in programs to help people break that horrible addiction. I can only conclude that some people high up in the DEA have an agenda to the pharmacutical industry to want to criminalize such a miracle PLANT!

My son is disabled and things can get stressful as well as being alot hard work. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety as well as surgeries and physical injuries. I have 2 ruptured discs that were so bad I couldn't walk because my legs got numb, I had to have 2 knee surgeries, cholecystectomy and many tooth issues. I was on percoocet, morphine and oxycodone for 5+ years and needed to stop for my kids sake. I tried subozone which resulted in my liver becoming toxic and tooth abscesses. I tried to quit subocone but my doctor said I \"was not ready\". I had never had an addiction issue only physical dependancy so the doctor not helping me quit the drug regardless of my history and ongoing physical issues from it was terrible. I was getting sicker and sicker from the subocone aND I had to take it on myself. SUbozone is almost 100x stronger than morphine. I don't know if you can but imagine withdrawling off a drug this strong but it was hands down the most difficult thing I have ever done. Afterm 3 days and the situation getting worse I could see how my family as a whole was suffering from my preoccupation with the withdrawl. I have always tried natural cures and they generally always worked. So I read about kratom, and decided to try it. The first time I took kratom all my physical withdraw symptoms ceased as well as the anxiety and depression. I felt normal while withdrawalin from one of the strongest opiates on the world. My kids were so happy to have me back and if it wasn't for kraton I would probably be dead from a terrible physician and drug I was put on. Please don't ban kratom, there's millions of people in he same situation,  and if they have an alternative to deal with the intense physical and emotional pain withdrawal causes they can be more productive citizens and therefore make the world a better place. I believe in 12 step programs, but I tell everyone about my experience,  how bad the subocone and the doctors prescribing it are as well as the miraculous curing effect kratom had on me and undoubtedly saved me and my famity from more difficult times and disapointment. furthermore I currently take small amounts of kraton for chronic back pain and knee pain and I have not needed or wanted any type of painkiller since finding the benefits of kratom. Banning kratom is an injustice to people becausw ot is a very effective painkiller as well as an alternative to more physically addictive substances while not altering your mental state at all. Let's work together and actually make the world a better place for our children and their future and allow all the possibilities for healthy recoveries and pain management .","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3621","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Mongole","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am typing this out today in hopes that Kratom would be kept legal federally as well as in the states that deem it legal.

The damage one to my body and the subsequent pain I experienced at times was all consuming. With a full time job and small children at home I found life intolerable. If I took the opiates to curb the pain I would wake up the following day groggy and in worst pain.  I became depressed and knew I would not be able to work much longer.\nAfter much research I discovered Kratom.  I researched as much as I could on it and finally decided to try it.  The relief I got was immediate.  I experienced zero side effects.  I woke the next day able to get up and go to work.  I have never experienced anything resembling hallucinations or any thing close to a dangerous side affect.  I am able to care for my children and work due to a non opiate option for pain.  I once questioned if continuing life with this level of constant pain was worth it.  I felt useless to my family when after working I crawled into bed and could barely move.  \nI have days in which I do not have to take it at all and I don't experience any withdrawal symptoms and I have never had to increase the amount I take.  When taking opiates I had been up to 1500 mg and still felt little relief.  I found something that would help me and was natural not created in a lab.  I beg the DEA to please think of the people who do not want to be addicted to opiates and want nothing more then to be productive members of society and not on disability due to pain or the meds we would have to take.  Please do not take away from us a means to avoid addiction and live our lives peacefully.   I had heard that it could help with addiction and was able to help a friend through Kratom quit opiates after 10 years.  She can now function and work full time.  All from a plant that has been used for thousands of years.  I ask the government to not take away our ability to make the decision that we feel is best for us or even limit it.  I am so afraid of the prospect of going back to life before I discovered something that would help my pain.

Kratom has benefited my life in many ways. Since the age of 26 I have had debilitating chronic pain caused by degenerative disks. It has made my young life very difficult and even led to serious depression. When the doctor I was going to first prescribed me opiates they helped at first but between tolerance issues, health and life dangers and the massive potential for addiction I have had to reject this form of treatment. I do not want to take opiates for pain relief. Most people in chronic pain including myself have had tremendous problems even getting the care we deserve and pay for. The regulations on opiate medications have caused doctors to leave people in debilitating pain and without hope for their futures. This was my experience as well, it was very difficult to even convince the numerous doctors I have seen to help at all. After feeling completely neglected by the medical industry  research online led to kratom. My first experience with the natural and safe supplement proved to help me tremendously. In many ways I felt I had my life back. In september when the prospect of scheduling kratom came up myself and thousands of people in this country were devastated. I never thought the government or DEA would have the slightest interest in kratom. It is safe and helps people everyday. I know it is safe because I have taken the supplement for 2 years on and off. The science that I read from the DEA was not congruent with reports from users of kratom and in my own opinion/ Experience it did not represent the kratom plant and its effects. I ask that you please understand the uses of kratom and the fact that many thousands will be left in debilitating pain by this decision. We have tried to give testimonials, we have tried to provide the accurate science, we have made every effort to stop this ban because it is life with pain and misery or life that allows for kratom to be used as a supplement, therefore a pain free existence. In my own user experience I have become a very productive member of our society. Having my body back is the biggest gift I have ever received and I could not explain the fear I have of being left to rot by the DEA and their desicion. Please do not take this safe natural supplement from the people of this country in life destroying pain. Kratom is a plant and a safe supplement that is being unjustifiably attacked. Every person in this great country should have the birth right to refuse opiate medication and have the basic human right to use nature as a supplement. While I believe 100% that the DEA is not only necessary but helps to keep many people safe from street drugs I believe this would be a massive disservice to myself, the pain community, people without health insurance, and those that refuse opiate medication. Please hear our cries for justice and help us to continue to have the right to supplements.

I like to take it with coffee as it kind of gives me an extra little perk. Kratom has done wonderful things for me throughout my days, such as removed social anxiety, allow me to focus on otherwise boring or repetitive tasks, helps me in crowds of people, and lowers my stress/blood pressure.\n\nI have experienced very minor withdrawal symptoms when stopping kratom for a few days here or there, mostly a bit of restless leg, slight chills and difficulty concentrating. All of these are very mild and from what I've been told and seen, are nowhere near the severity of a detox of say alcohol or heroin. You can actually die from detoxing off of alcohol, and the heroin detox apparently makes you want to die it is so bad.\n\nIn the past, I have tried other substances and have also been prescribed pharmaceuticals for various things(minor surgeries, dental work, etc), and have actually been 'high' from these substances, where I wouldn't be able to work or operate a car or any other machinery. My balance and judgement were impaired, and it was best to sit on a couch watching TV or sleeping it off.\n\nKratom has never impaired me anywhere near this level. In fact, I doubt it has ever impaired me at all. My digital marketing agency has grown to be a 6 figure annual small business with many clients who trust me to manage their marketing. I sometimes work 16 hour days. The company continues to grow and I have never thought about slacking off because I want to go get high on Kratom.. Never has that even crossed my mind, as having been a consumer of this herb, I know that it would be impossible to get such a high. \n\nIs alcohol a schedule 1 with an imminent public health crisis? No. Yet it is incredibly more powerful, addictive, dangerous, and impairing.\n\nIs coffee a schedule 1 with an imminent health crisis? No. And yet, the effects of coffee are similar to the effects of Kratom, with similar withdrawals.\n\nBy moving this to a Schedule 1, it would affect me in many ways. First, I wwill likely be a criminal because it is something that has helped my life, and I would need to attempt to secure it on a newly created 'Black market'. I would have to buy it fro criminals who don't care about me or the purity of this naturally grown, God given plant.\n\nOur friends to the north in Canada can buy this plant legally, just about anywhere. What kind of border security would we need to stop this from coming in through the north, just like so many substances make their way through our ports and southern borders.\n\nAs a tax paying citizen, I urge you to not expand the drug war, but rather shrink it. It costs too much money and it improisons too many harmless, peaceful people. It is financially contributing to the shrinking of the middle class and making us poorer.\n\nLet's continue the discussion and look toward at the very most, regulating the market, not just blindly banning something that is no more dangerous than multivitamins, health supplements, and coffee.\n\nThanks for the withdrawal of the original letter, and I look forward to a sensible conclusion to this issue.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0525","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a registered nurse who after 23 years of taking care of people, my body has begun to have aches and pains during my 12 hour shifts.

Corynantheidine: Opioid antagonist \n? Corynoxeine: Calcium channel blocker\n? Corynoxine A and B: Dopamine mediating anti-locomotives  \n? (-)-Epicatechin: Antioxidant, antiaggregant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antihepatitic, anti-inflammatory, anti-leukemic, antimutagenic, antiperoxidant, antiviral, cancer preventative, alpha-amylase inhibitor  \n? 9-Hydroxycorynantheidine: Partial opioid agonist\n? 7-Hydroxymitragynine: Analgesic, antitussive, antidiarrheal; primary psychoactive in kratom\n? Isomitraphylline: Immunostimulant, anti-leukemic\n? Isopteropodine: Immunostimulant\n? Mitragynine: Analgesic, antitussive, antidiarrheal, adrenergic, antimalarial, possible (5-HT2A) antagonist (anti-psychotic)\n? Mitraphylline: Vasodilator, antihypertensive, muscle relaxer, diuretic, anti-amnesic, possible immunostimulant\n? Paynantheine: Smooth muscle relaxer\n?

Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom as a safer alternative, and all promising scientific studies on its role in opioid treatment would be immediately shut down by a Schedule I designation.  Kratom is a medicinal plant and natural substance used for millennia in Southeast Asia and currently used by millions in the U.S that is being actively studied in the U.S. for therapeutic uses.\n\nSchedule I is reserved for substances that have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and no accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision, criteria that differ from scientific literature exploring kratom and its constituents.\n\nThis designation would effectively halt scientific investigation into kratoms medicinal benefits, while making it impossible to enact sensible legal regulations, such as quality control measures,product labeling requirements, as well as marketing, branding and retail display restrictions, which are long proven to reduce substance misuse and youth access.\n\nDecisions about how drugs are classified and regulated should be guided by science -- not by law enforcement. Scheduling decisions should be led by federal health agencies, with input from independent scientists and experts.\n\nAdditionally, this designation would lead to more people who struggle with addiction to be criminalized and additional unnecessary mass incarcerations!  There is widespread moral, political and scientific consensus that drug use and addiction are best treated as health issues rather than as criminal,theres should be no good reason to criminalize people simply for using kratom especially considering how much we already know aboutprohibitions disproportionate impact on people of color and other marginalized communities.

She had 2 beautiful daughter who were 19 & 26 at the time, this has forever changed my families life, since then my youngest niece & my daughter both game birth to 2 beautiful baby girls a week & a day apart, so I have stepped in as Aunt Nan, my 2 grandchildren call me Nana. Fast forward to April 2015 I had to have back surgery, as you can imagine me as a recovering addict myself & my family were scared of any kind of pain medications, so a good friend of mine who is an herbalist suggested Kratom as an herbal supplements. From that day it has changed my life, as you can imagine, I suffer from severe depression & anxiety since my only sister who was my best friend in this world went to heaven to be with my mother who we lost in 2007 to cancer. Im pleading with you please, please do not put another family through what ours has been through. Knowing that there is a safe herbal all natrual plant to, all of these issues. I do not want to become a criminal. I still go to therapy once a week for my depression & trauma over loosing my sister & my mother. I  have 3 girls & 3 grandchildren depending on me to be here for them. Thank you for your time.

The FDA ban of mitragyna speciosa would ignore the laws of states which voted to keep kratom legal as well as our neighbors Canada and Mexico where kratom is legal and its medicinal value recognized. Prohibition is becoming quite unpopular as of late, and if your agency went against the will of so many people it would become clear to more and more people that government agencies do not work for us in our society anymore. If kratom becomes a casualty of the war on drugs unfairly, as it is a plant which has been used safely for hundreds of years by people of the SE Asian countries, then you run the risk of losing some credibility when you attempt to ban dangerous new drugs. I am glad that you agreed to open comments on the ban and delay making a decision. It shows that you are listening to us and you are open to compromise. Please do not ban kratom as I feel that it is a decision made for all the wrong reasons, not a necessary ban for the sake of public health. I have witnessed kratom help people deal with chronic pain and end opiate addiction. I have not heard about any adverse health effects or of anyone becoming addicted to it for a high.

They offer proof that extract and tinctures have the same side effects of most hard drugs.\n\nAll were posted over two years ago.\n\n#1\nFST are as close to heroin as you can get. They feel dirty, the high is crazy euphoric, the worst itches I've ever experienced and makes you nod off about the same. Even after two days, you need about double your original dose just to feel \"normal\" and the high is almost nonexistent, similar to heroin. \nThe withdrawals are terrible. Flu like, sore throat, always tired, muscle aches, anxiety. Ugh, every year or so I forget about all of this and buy about 60-70 dollars of FST and subsequently have the worst time ever. STAY AWAY!\nIf you're looking to get high off Kratom, you're doing it for the wrong reasons. With that said, I'd actually suggest that you go cop off the streets or get something from your doctor since FST is so dangerous and such a slippery slope. Post tincture withdrawals are way worse than any low level opiate (Vicodin, Percocet) I've had a habit it from. While it may not be as bad as a heroin habit, it's close and not worth it at all!\n\n#2\nDisclaimer: I accept full responsibility for any stupidity I have gotten myself into.\nI was able to have a fairly healthy relationship with Bali powder for a long time (over 2 years). My relationship with FST was immediately bad. The tolerance shot up - even when I did my damndest to use the stuff carefully, that tolerance shot up. Soon was using a bottle a day and would get classic opiod style withdrawals if I didn't get some at least every 4 hours. This included dosing in the middle of the night. Pathetic.\nI decided to kick cold turkey this past Friday. The first 3 days were equal to any hell I have experienced with pharmaceutical opiate withdrawals. Uncontrollable RLS in my legs and arms, deep bone aches, chills, crushing depression, insomnia, and of course the shits. \nOn day 6 things got better but I still have lingering body aches, some chills, diarrhea, depression and most of all - terrible insomnia. I have never struggled with insomnia in the past and now my heart goes out to those who have. It's a bitch and a half. Nothing touches it - Klonopin, weed, Lyrica... \nAnyhow, again I am just saying this in the spirit of harm reduction. I think Kratom can be responsibly used by many people. I just don't think the tinctures have much to offer and are way too risky. \n\n#3 - The \"O\" in other is an obvious reference to opiates\nI have been using Kratom for sometime as well... I dont know much.. but SS's FST is the best in the land. I actually prefer it to \"O\"ther things.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0324","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me in so many ways.

I know many people who have used it to overcome hard opiate addiction, and I am afraid for what might happen to those individuals if they were no longer able to access this helpful plant. Opiate addiction relapse happens at very high rates without replacement therapy, and kratom, for some, can be as effective as much more potent alternatives like suboxone and methadone. For many, the latter options are not options at all. Such individuals would sooner just go back to heroin or whatever hard opiate of choice. It is my belief that some people are just wired to be opiate addicts, and it seems as though kratom provides a much milder alternative than any pharmaceutical or street narcotics available. \n\nMany people who have used kratom for extended periods of time report minimal withdraw symptoms, similar to those from caffeine. It seems illogical to ban kratom while not banning similar drugs like coffee. I mean, where are we heading with this policy, I thought our country collectively doesn't believe in draconian rules such as those we would expect to find under sharia law. The way I see it, if you're going to ban kratom, might as well ban alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and while you're at it, let's require women to cover their faces in public and always be accompanied by a male relative when outside of the home. \n\nFurthermore, this all seems very suspicious, given pharmaceutical companies are beginning to examine the benefits of the active ingredients of kratom. Has their potential intent to monopolize these chemicals been fully analyzed? \n\nAs I understand, there have been a total of 5 deaths linked to kratom, and in at least 4 of these cases it was shown the individual used other drugs such as heroin in combination with kratom. And, i'm sure I'm telling you something you already know when I say that junkies are notorious liars. \n\nAlso, it has been reported that many gas station varieties have been laced with other research chemical opioids. If anything is to be done, we should be randomly purchasing kratom from suppliers, testing it for other chemicals added, and shutting down or at least penalizing those suppliers that provide contaminated product.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18375","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Pfahl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 54 year old mother,grandmother,and a housekeeper by profession. I have chronic pain through out my body due to an accident back in 2001 and Graves disease I developed in 2007. I have arthritis,fibro myalgia,and neuropathy. For years I have been on different kinds of pain medications. I still had problems with pain and it affected my every day life. It was hard to do my job,do every day tasks,and even enjoy anything. That caused me to become depressed. At one point I even became addicted to hydrocodone. About 4 months ago a neighbor suggested I try kratom. Since then,my life has greatly improved! I still have some pain,but I can manage it. My days are much easier to get through and the depression is gone! I love the idea of using kratom as it is a natural herb and safe to use. I've known people,including my best friend,who have died from opiate overdosing. I also know people who's lives revolve around opiates. This is very sad. Kratom saves lives and helps people,not hurt them. I strongly feel that kratom should remain as it is,a readily available botanical herb. It is no more addicting than coffee,soda,or McDonald's.

I am not one of these people- I did heroin, but I quit cold turkey, as I decided I didn't want to live the dysfunctional, self-destructive life of an addict. I use Kratom in place of more intense pharmaceuticals-- whereas I used to do oxycontin in insane amounts (like, 6 oxy 80's a day), now I just have a little Kratom. This isn't because it's a comparable high- Kratom can't hold a candlle to real opioids. In fact, most of the people I've given some to, who do heroin, don't like it, and would rather just spend the money on heroin. People who take Kratom are dedicated to quitting the more addictive drug that started them on opioids in the first place- unlike most people who take methadone (maybe not suboxone- I haven't met anyone who's had it, because of its low abuse potential). Kratom, for me, provides a slight 'relaxed' feeling, while giving me energy, and I use it in a manner similar to coffee.\n\nThe active alkaloids in Kratom do not cause respiratory depression, and actually preferentially bind to delta, as opposed to mu, or morphine, receptors. The small amount of the active alkaloids in Kratom that actually hit mu (morphine, again, for the laymen) receptors are just enough to help people with chronic pain relieve their pain, help an ex-junkie stay off of drugs, or help just about anyone with a really bad cough, though Kratom, in my experience, doesn't really provide much cough suppression.\n\nBAN KRATOM AND PEOPLE WILL GO BACK TO THE DRUGS THAT THEY STARTED ON, AND MANY WILL OVERDOSE AND DIE\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0131","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Sederholm","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a 36 year old single mother and small business owner, my diagnosis of fibromyalgia was devastating!

I fell back into the addictive mind set due to overwhelming pain I experience from work (plumbing)and daily stresses of having to maintain a healthy lifestyle,  I was taking norcos daily for the last 4 months, until I finally came  across Kratom which truly saved my life, it freed me from all the pain, aggression, and moodswings I would experience while taking the norcos. Kratom has a stigma due to non users not experiencing the effects of what this beautiful plant is capable of and speaking from a biased persepctive due to personal beliefs. It is a leaf of faith that can truly assist and help many addicts overcome their opiate addiction. Given that I have been involved in a lifestyle of addiction for the past 16 years, I know many people who still have addictions problems, and me being the loving, caring and compassionate individual I AM, I offered some Kratom to several of my friends who suffered with opiate addiction, who's lifes were truly broken, bent and on the edge of dying, now they don't need to rely on a impure substance  such as oxycotton, norco, heroin, for they experienced the true, natural, pure effects of Kratom. Conclusion of the matter is this, just because you don't agree with it, doesn't mean that it's not saving the lives of 1000s of other individuals who suffered with addiction. This is a beautiful and sacred plant that needs to be treated with respect and understanding. Thano you for allowing me to express my thoughts and feelings about kratom.

I don't know if you have ever felt a sciatica flare up but it is almost unbearable. 6 years ago I was on heavy doses of hydrocodone and Klonopin to manage the pain and I quickly became addicted to my medicine. And after a while it stopped working and I needed to take more and more to have any kind of pain relief. When I had to stop taking my medicine to withdrawal was absolute hell. My doctors did not warn me about the withdrawal. They kept upping my dose of pain medicine never warned me how hard it would be to not take it. I soon moved to Oregon and was making very little money so I didn't have a doctor I could afford when my sciatica came back. I would be in extreme pain for 2 weeks and then it would go away for a week and come back a week later and last for weeks on end. I clean houses at the time so it was extremely inconvenient to be in that kind of pain all the time. And that's when I found kratom. I could take just a couple of grams and my pain would be gone. I can't begin to describe the relief of being pain free after spending weeks in that kind of pain. And the best part of all is when I didn't take it I didn't have any negative side effects. It wasn't like with the pain medicine where I had to take it all the time to keep myself from having withdrawals. And I also didn't need to spend hundreds of dollars at a doctor's office for them to give me something that wouldn't help and to go back every month and continue to not receive the help I needed. I have been taking Kratom for 5 years now. Please keep people like me in mind who live with chronic pain and can't afford a doctor and don't want to go back to being addicted to their pain medicine which doctors will not even prescribe any more. There really are no other options for some of us.

I first tried Kratom having no knowledge whatsoever about the effects or traditional usage of the plant. I found it to be mildly stimulating and relaxing at the same time,also giving some relief to a persistent lower back pain I have suffered from for years. In my opinion this substance certainly does have a potential for addiction  but probably less than many other substances that are legal such as coffee, tobacco and alcohol. Our country is currently in the grip of an opioid epidemic , both pharmaceutical (oxcycontin,etc,) and contraband ( Heroin and the synthetic parallel substances}. I personally have lost a friend to this scourge.Many are struggling to escape from this addiction and kratom is providing people with an opportunity to do so without resorting to the much stronger and more dangerous pharmaceutical opioids .There is minimal danger from the use of kratom and to deny people who are in need of this alternative ,on the grounds of protecting the people , strikes me as cruel and inconsiderate in the extreme.To deny a safe alternative to opioids ,on the contrary , is a sentence of death to many . Mark my words , death from overdose will spike dramatically, if you reschedule  this wonderful beneficial plant. Just as for many years so many lives have been damaged or destroyed by the wrongful scheduling of cannabis, a wonderful ,God given medicine as well , in the name of protecting the people! I believe passionately that it is time you learned from your mistakes . Stop  denying to the populace the simple beneficial plant medicines that have been in use for millennia!

I am a 51 yr old nurse practitioner and have done so for 15 years.  I am the DEA to please not schedule or ban Kratom supplement.  I am a current user of this beneficial supplement  and have used the product for approximately 4 years. I like other people in my age group suffer from severe degenerative joint disease as well as chronic severe spinal disc disease that leaves me with significant daily pain.  Additionally, I have peripheral neuropathy in my lower legs and feet.  I have worked in the emergency room for most of my 15 years as a nurse practitioner.  I have never taken opium based products on a daily basis because of the devastating effects I have personally observed in the chronic opiate user for chronic pain.  The effects of opium used on a daily basis is not effective and has caused millions of Americans to become addicts.  I see the typical behaviors addicts use to manipulate everyone in their life that eventually destroys any kind of functional life for these people and have witnessed many drug overdoses and deaths in this population of people who never intended to be a drug addict.  This unfortunate population become manipulators and will do anything to continue to use opiates.  At this point, these people are no longer taking opiates for pain relief but for a sense of \" feeling good\" all the way to death from overdose.  The vast majority of this population would never have become addicts if they had a supplement or product that actually works for pain relief and not dependence.  I do not want to become part of this unfortunate population!  Kratom has been a SAFE product for me to treat my chronic pain.  Without Kratom, I fully believe that I would no longer be a functioning, productive citizen any longer and will probably become completely disabled.  I do not know how this product works.  I urge the DEA to invest their efforts in learning how this supplement decreases and in my case almost relieves it completely.  Kratom does not cause any alteration or decrease in my mental capacity to be a highly functioning professional in a fast paced environment.  I have gone weeks at a time between purchasing the product and have never had any withdrawal effects.  I only experience the excursating pain and neuropathy in my back, legs and feet.  If you have ever tried this botanical supplement, you would understand that it impossible to overdose or alter your senses and mentation.  I personally know that this supplement is safe in my life.  I undergo my yearly health check ups with lab work and have undergone a routine colonoscopy to make sure that this product is safe.  Kratom has been a miracle for me and my daily life.  I believe that if people had been given the opportunity to use Kratom supplement instead of opiates, they would chose Kratom.  No one starts out wanting to be an opiate addict.  These people are only seeking pain relief so, they can function \"normally.\"  I have witnessed many good people become unintentional opiate addicts over a 15 year span.   I am pleading with you to support the Kratom community and call for more research on this botanical species to how it actually works.  I believe Kratom is an answer to the treatment of neurological and bone type chronic pain people suffer from.  My own personal use and research of this product is that it is an effective treatment for bone and neurological chronic pain syndromes.  Kratom does not give you a \"feel good\" sensation, it simply decreases or stops the chronic pain I suffer from.  I am urging you to please learn more about this botanical that our lord God has placed on earth and is not a man made substance that is harmful to mankind.  Kratom is a gift placed here for our benefit.  It is our duty to study and research this botanical and let people know how God has provided a natural substance to relieve the everyday pain people experience due to the wear tear of hard work that has stressed and damaged our bodies.  I am urging the DEA to stand with me and the Kratom community and do not ban or schedule this botanical .\nSincerely, \nTeresa Fitts, Family Nurse Practitioner-Board Certified","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1667","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Teresa Fitts","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For me personally placing kratom on a schedule 1 list would be a very poor decision.

Since puberty I've suffered with severe anxiety, depression, ADHD, and more. By age 19 I had already been diagnosed with multiple stomach ulcers caused by constant stress and had back problems from my time working as a CNA in a nursing home. I've been on every antidepressant, anxiety med, and sleeping pill under the sun to no avail. I might feel better for awhile but my anxiety and depression always drug me back down. Trying to stop those medications had life threatening effects that I wasn't even aware of until i was dealing with them first hand. For years I drank alcohol to cope with my issues which only caused more problems. Since I was introduced to Kratom about 6 months ago I have no desire to drink and am far less reliant on medications like Adderall, Effexor, Valium, Ambien, Flexeril. Supplementing with Kratom daily has allowed me to cut back or even stop taking some of these medications entirely due to the plants positive effects. My mood, pain, and energy levels are more balanced and because of that my anxiety and depression have eased significantly. Instead of drinking my pain away I can now enjoy every moment with my 19 month old son, thus making me a better mother.\nI am against any scheduling of Kratom being used in it's raw, natural form. Kratom doesn't get me high or impair my judgement. Instead, I feel more alert and focused than I ever felt on antidepressants and bezodiazapines. Kratom is not a synthetic drug however, if it's banned I'm certain a dangerous synthetic attempting to mimic it's alkaloids will not be far behind. This plant is far too complex to even be given a lower schedule at this point in time without additional research because every individual is different and a doctor would not know how to adequately prescribe strains and dosages for the wide array of benefits Kratom can offer. Kratom is not a cure for anything but it is certainly an herbal supplement that should be available for myself and other consumers. If the goal here is to protect the public, do more research and require vendors to test their product for purity to avoid any harmful synthetics being added. Prohibition is not the answer. We as people of a free nation should be able to choose what to do with a safe, all natural plant. Thank you for your consideration. Please do not schedule Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4254","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"April Hiltabidle","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\nI'm a 26 year old woman, who is disabled from a chronic illness.

I have a bachelor's degree in sociology and have years of work experience in medical and substance abuse facilities and have seen the benefits of this plant firsthand.

It truly is non-threatening and nothing but beneficial hence it's use for centuries. Unfortunately many misconceptions have arisen and this plant has been lumped in the category with these other new and terrifying substances popping up around the country.

I, in all honesty, can not believe this could be schedulded as a controlled substance. For one, I use it for my sleep disorder.

I also use it in the mornings after a night of no sleep, although; it does not help me sleep every night. But I believe it also has a similar effect as coffee, but with a slightly mild boost. I see no reason to abuse this herb, I also use it for my social anxiety. I've recommended it to friends and family who have similar complications. I and everyone in my life do not abuse it. There's no reason or desire to abuse it. I do understand it's been an eye catcher by the younger generation by head shops and other sources. I will testify that this plant does not get you \"high.\" I am 23 years old, I'm around alcohol and other substances from time to time. I can legally purchase alcohol, so if I wanted to \"party\" and get \"high,\" by all means, nothing would stop me. But I don't, I choose this plant because I can still function as I can when I'm sober. I see no potential for this to be abused as a recreational substance. I also do not view it as an herb to treat any illness. The effects are mildly noticed, and it is nowhere near a prescribed substance and should never be categorized as such. Research shows that it is in the same family/category as coffee, and it is used for nothing more by myself. As I've stated, personally, I see no use for abusing it recreationally. I have yet to notice any side effects from use. It does not keep me up at night, and I have no complications with consistant use. I see no reason to place Mitragyna Speciosa as a Schedule I substance!

The DEA was going to ban a health supplement that's in the coffee family and has helped so many people for a variety of reasons? It truly threw me for a loop. The DRUG enforcement agency was going to ban something that many people use for mild pain management (myself included) and force us to have to use highly addictive narcotic drugs while there is an opiod epidemic in this country? It's been studied before and found the leaves weren't addictive like heroin or Vicodin.  was baffled, it contradicts itself.\n\nMy story with kratom started five years ago after I had my second baby. During the pregnancy and afterwards (to this very day) I had terrible migraines, so bad that I couldn't function through my daily life. After the pregnancy, I tried numerous migraine medications, blood pressure pills, tension headache medications, etc., and nothing seemed to work. I saw a neurologist and had MRIs done and the bottom line was that I just had chronic migraines. I started taking Vicoprofen to help with the pain, and while it did help, it made me nauseated and tired and unlike myself. I couldn't take my kids anywhere if I took it and I couldn't play with them if I didn't because I was in so much pain. I started researching alternative methods to migraine control and came across kratom. I researched and researched and researched and finally decided to try it because anything had to be better than what I was doing. The bottom line is, kratom helped with my migraines immensely and though it doesn't work as well as a narcotic, I could function and I wasn't tired and compared to a full blown migraine, I could absolutely deal with minor twinges here and there. \n\nI know of many people who use kratom for almost anything you can think of-back aches (like my husband), insomnia, depression, tooth aches, RLS, an alternate to coffee in the morning, and one of the biggest ones to me is that this plant helps people get off heroin and other opioids. I know of health detox places that have helped so many addicts withdraw off these strong, addictive drugs. I know even know of elderly people who drink kratom tea.  I myself have taken kratom for around five years, as needed, and I react to it the same way I do when I drink coffee, to me they are almost the same thing. Kratom users don't overdose, they don't get in car accidents because of it, they don't steal or commit crime because of kratom, they don't chose kratom over their children and families, they don't lose their jobs because of kratom, etc. To compare kratom to drugs like meth and heroin, drugs that absolutely destroy people's lives and everyone around them, is just wrong on so many levels.\n\nI guess all I can say to conclude is to ask you to let this one be. I know you have an important job to do and I completely respect you for that, but you're way off base with this one. I'm asking you as a mother, a wife, a daughter, and a productive member of society to please understand the health benefits to this supplement. I do not want to take narcotics pills again (ever if I can help it) and I won't have a choice if kratom is available. Those drugs kill people and thinking about having to be on them for a long period of time really scares me. \n\nThanks for reading, I hope to send you a thank you here in the immediate future.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22653","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Candice Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've personally used Kratom for several years, with the primary goal of reducing alcohol dependence and consumption.

I have had Crohn's disease since my early adult life. Eventually I had to stop working in a lucrative and rewarding career in order to manage this disease, and mitigate the effects of stress on it. I have been on a variety of medicines for this disease including the most recent and very expensive biologics. Most are very expensive, have dangerous / damaging side effects and none have given me significant, lasting relief. \n\nOn my own, I have tried, in parallel with conventional medicines for Crohn's disease, almost every herbal medicine and alternative therapy out there. I ran across Kratom a number of years ago and am a regular user as it is the ONLY substance that provides substantial and consistent relief from the symptoms of this horrible disease. My doctors are aware of my use of this natural remedy, and have not discouraged me from using it.  I have experienced absolutely no side-effects from my daily use of Kratom. It is also inexpensive when compared to ANY prescription drug I've been on. One doctor has even expressed an interest in recommending it to other patients of his who suffer from IBD given my remarkable outcome.\n\nThere are little or no intoxicating effects from this medicine...if anything, it is a mild stimulant akin to coffee. It you doubt this, buy some and try it!!! With marijuana becoming legal in many states (including my ow home state of Florida), which DOES have intoxicating effects, I can't fathom what the DEA's motivation is for taking away this mild and innocuous medicine that provides safe and effective relief to so many, with no evidence to the contrary.

This herbal supplement has greatly improved the lives of millions across the country and implementing a ban on Kratom will worsen the existing opioid epidemic. An estimated 69% of users stated that they will seek opioid medication as an alternative if Kratom becomes illegal [1]. 29 million people cannot afford health insurance and a single hospital visit can cost tens of thousands of dollars or more [2]. Acute and chronic illnesses have destroyed the finances of so many citizens. Although I do not believe that Kratom should be a substitute for medical care, people can use Kratom to manage diagnosed chronic symptoms that otherwise forces them into ongoing expensive doctor visits.\nI am a 32 year-old male and have been a daily consumer of Kratom for 5 years. I am deeply grateful for those pain-free years. My experience with Kratom has been nothing short of life-changing. I have a history of a herniated disc in my lower back as well as left-sided kidney problems including multiple surgeries and kidney stones. I spent two years being prescribed Hydrocodone and Oxycodone by my physician. I consumed these medications on a daily basis and every 3-6 months my physician decided to increase my dosage. My primary reason for the pursuit of a natural alternative to opioids was because these drugs caused me to feel trapped, dependent, depressed, and hopeless. I also learned that these medications are derived from the same source as heroin and can be equally addictive and potentially deadly. My doctor failed to explain the history and risks associated with prescription opioids. Even if I was informed, there is no better alternative in prescription pain management except for Kratom.\nKratom provides me with a significantly reduced level of pain, which allows me to live a normal happy life. My health insurance provider and I are not forced to spend significant sums of money to see a physician on a monthly basis for the purpose of receiving pain medications. To further hinder patients experiencing chronic pain, the CDC has released new opioid prescribing guidelines in March, 2016 which recommends physicians to scale back on prescribing pain medications [3]. With regard to people in chronic pain, physicians provide very few effective alternatives to opioid medication. I have tried chiropractic care, over-the-counter pain medication, topical creams, back support devices, stretches, and exercises and none of these methods came close to the relief provided by Kratom. My use of Kratom has not altered my daily life in any way. I have worked full-time, I help support my wife and daughter, and I currently maintain a 3.15 GPA in college with the help of Kratom. This natural remedy has never hindered my ability to function normally. In fact, Kratom has allowed me to have a better quality of life by suppressing my chronic pain. Although Kratom elevates my mood, I have never felt a \"high\" through the use of this herbal supplement. Claims have alleged that Kratom is both habit-forming and increases tolerance over time. If I stop taking Kratom, I experience mild symptoms very similar to quitting a caffeine regiment. For the past 5 years I have taken the exact same dose with no need to increase.\nI discovered that people around the world benefit from Kratom. I also found that Kratom is grown, harvested, processed, and sold in a 100% natural state. There are no chemical alterations or synthesized processes in the production of Kratom, unlike prescribed and illicit opioids. Kratom is not a member of the opioid family but instead falls directly into the coffee family. It is known that Kratom binds to opioid receptors in the brain, but this is not been extensively studied. A natural substance is not classified as an opioid just because it contains elements that bind to opioid receptors. For example, here are some items used in our daily lives that contain opioid compounds: dark chocolate contains an antioxidant, epicatechin, that binds to the -opioid receptors; the oil cafestrol in coffee is known to produce morphine-like activity, spinach contains the opioid peptides rubiscolins-5 and rubiscolins-6; an opioid peptide known as gluten exorphin is found in wheat; and an opioid peptide called casomorphin is found in cow's milk. Just because Kratom contains a compound that is known to bind with certain opioid receptors doesn't automatically require it to be labeled as a dangerous opioid substance. Otherwise chocolate, coffee, spinach, wheat, and milk must also be labeled as opioids. [4]\nThe Drug Enforcement Agency reports that Kratom is \"an imminent threat to public safety\", but a ban on Kratom will only further support this claim. The continued legalization of Kratom will only prove the opposite. --- (Comment continues in the attached file)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19652","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Benjamin Spaethe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"There need to be definite dosage limits if Kratom is available to the general public.

I realize there can be benefits to using Kratom but the severe side effects of possible overdose can and should be avoided by monitoring through a health care professional.

I just want to voice my opinions on and experience of using  kratom (mitragyna speciosa). I have been taking kratom off and on for roughly five years. Which is to say I will take kratom for several months then stop for several months. I use it to help alleviate severe anxiety and depression and find it helps me to \"deal\" with hard situations in life. Such as recently when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I am unable to take most prescription anxiety medications due to the side effects such as lethargy and severe shakes. Kratom on the other hand alleviates my anxiety with virtually no side effects. In my opinion there are two things that make kratom superior to prescription anxiety medications such as Xanax. Firstly, when kratom is taken as directed, as an herbal supplement, it does not induce lethargy and an inability to function in daily life when enough is taken to alleviate my anxiety and the same can not be said for Xanax. Secondly and probably most importantly is I am able to take it for several months and stop \"cold turkey\" with no physical side effects. The first and last time I used Xanax to treat anxiety I only used it for a 2-3 week period. At the end of that several week period I experienced what I believe to be withdraw symptoms caused by the Xanax. I was unable to sleep and felt very uncomfortable physically for 3 or 4 days. Kratom has never had that negative effect on me and I expect it never will after 5 years of use. The fact that the DEA has determined there are no medical uses for kratom but there are medical uses for Xanax and other worthless addictive prescription anxiety medications is pure insanity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3168","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Elliott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom it May Concern,\n\nMy Name is Mandi Li. I am 38 years old. I have suffered feom anxiety and depression since I was a child, including many periods of suicidal ideations. I have done a great deal of therapy including inpatient, group, and one-on-one, which has certainly helped me throughout the years but did not \"cure\" me of my condition. I have also been prescribed more types of psychiatric medications than I could not possibly list with great accuracy, but I will make an attempt.Some of these medications include, but are not limited to, Paxil, Zoloft, ,Seroquel, Lamictal, Valium, Xanax, Ametryptolene, etc. Each new therapist seemed to have a slightly different idea about my diagnosis, and therefore, how I should be medicated. All of the medications I tried had more negative effects than positive. Some might make me feel less nervous, but the trade-off was feeling heavily sedated and therefore depresed. I always felt drugged. \n\nA few years ago, after having weaned myself off of paxil, somebody suggested that I try Kratom tea. Since it wasnt something that I would have to commit to taking every day, I decided to give it a try. It worked great for me. I felt somewhat energized and my anxiety went way down. I have been taking it on a somewhat regular basis, ever since, and haven't had the need to try any new psychiatric meds. Since being introduced to kratom, my life has become a great deal more enjoyable to me. I am happily married, have several close and healthy friendships, and have been at the same job longer than ever before. \n\nI do not see kratom as a drug to get high because it doesn't make me feel high. It makes me feel like a normal person, for the first time in my life. I finally feel able to do the things that normal people do, such as keeping a job, using the phone, going new places, going outside to exercise, having solid relationships, and even talking with new people, when necessary.\n\nKratom is a natural supplement that has made a very positive impact in my life, at a price I can afford. Please do not take this option away from me and the thousands of other people whom it has been helping.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMandi Sue Li","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13666","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mandi Li","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, My name is Mike Hannahs and I am a chronic back pain sufferer.

Kratom gives me the same amount of pain relief minus the adverse and potentially dangerous effects of pain medication. I've always been grateful that I have a natural alternative to these dangerous pharmaceutical drugs. I'll never forget the day that I realized how dangerous pain medication could be even taken as directed. It was the day after thanksgiving 2012. I went to visit with my uncle and was the one to discover that he had died in his sleep from lack of oxygen caused by his medicine. I often wonder  if I had known about kratom earlier if it could of provided him with the pain relief that he needed and saved his life.... I've also lost friends who made the mistake of abusing opiates to achieve a high. I just wish that I had known about kratom earlier on in life and just maybe my uncle and friends would still be here.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5463","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eddie Jennings","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 44 year old woman, a mother of one child with special needs and three step-children. I have been married for 15 years. \n\nIn 1996, I was diagnosed with systemic lupus and later followed with a diagnosis of Sjogrens syndrome, fibromyalgia and poly arthritis. I have struggled with chronic pain most of my life as a result of autoimmune diseases. In 1999, my three month old son was tragically killed when our dog ran underneath his baby swing and knocked it over causing him to hit his head on the concrete floor and instantly died.

After approximately six months of research I decided to give Kratom a try, and haven't looked back since. I understand pain will always be a factor in my life, albeit Kratom has afforded a life which enables me to be an active participant in my husbands, daughters, and my own life. To my surprise I also found it helped with the ptssd and the depression. Furthermore, kratom has allowed me a life of being functional participant of society and after leaving a job of 23 yrs as a police officer, I decided I felt well enough to return to work. I am now employed as a funeral assistance and looking to return to school to obtain my funeral director's license.\n\nConventional pharmaceuticals and pain management did not work for me due to side effects.

Kratom was key in breaking my dangerous and risky addiction to prescription painkillers. I became addicted to Percocet the first time I tried one. For two years after I tried my first Percocet, I used any pill I could get my hands on, until I discovered Kratom. The first few times I tried Kratom I felt little to no effects. Eventually I used Kratom instead of prescription drugs. I dont use painkillers anymore. I took Kratom daily for four years and could stop taking it without a horrible withdrawal. While taking Kratom I made sure to complete annual health screens on my blood pressure, blood, and liver. My annual physicals have all come back normal.\nI strongly oppose the DEA decision to put Kratom on the list of schedule 1 substances. Furthermore, I dont believe that Kratom should be scheduled at all. Kratom is as moderate as coffee. Banning Kratom would do more bad than good for opiate addicts and good people who want a natural alterative. Personal use has me convinced that it is a healthy and safe alternative to dangerous and deadly prescription pills.

My daughter was severely injured 2.5 years ago suffering a massive Traumatic Brain Injury and multiple orthopedic injuries.  While she is alive and doing remarkably well considering the the extent of the Brain Trauma she sustained. She had to massive subcranial hematomas with multiple suffuse bleeds and damage to the Corpus Callosum. kratom has been an integral part of her success in being able to return to high school.  As a result of her TBI she has several issues that kratom has been extremely helpful with.  The first being an amazing aide to her chronic fatigue.  Before kratom she  was barely able to make it through a school day.  A typical day would be up at 6AM go to school come home at 2:30pm exhausted, depressed, and anxious and sleep for 4-5 hours and then get up do homework and go back to bed and sleep to 6AM and do it all over again.  Since the use of kratom, her day is get up at 6AM go to school come home smiling have a snack do home work, have dinner, socialize on the phone or skype or have energy to draw (she is an artist) or watch a movie.  At 9 or 10pm take a shower and go to bed. She is no longer anxious or have panic attacks.  Her short term memory is getting better as a result of the nootropic affects of kratom. Nootropics (pronunciation: /no.trpks/ noh--TROP-iks)are substances which are  cognitive enhancersthey may be drugs, supplements, or other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals.Her short term memory has been improving since her use of kratom where it had plateaued during the 6 months prior to her beginning use of kratom This herb has given my daughter her life back in so many ways.  The energy enhancing benefits with out jitters like coffee or prescription amphetamines is truly  unparalleled. She does not use it on weekends and the difference is unbelievable.  Without kratom she  sleeps most of both Saturday and Sunday. Sleeping for 75% of everyday which is what she would be doing without this herb is NOT LIVING!! She no longer gets panic attacks or severe  migraine headaches and her self confidence is returning.  Her grades have gone from 68-73 to new highs of  70- 86.  She now has the belief and confidence that she will eventually have a completely normal life and be able to go to college, graduate and have a sustaining career instead of being on SSI disability for the rest of her life.  This herb has taken the place of several prescription medicines with negative side affects. While they would have helped some they  had more disadvantages for her health than the advantages.  She has had ZERO negative side affects from kratom and only benefited in highly significant ways. Making it unobtainable and a felony will  take away any quality of life that my daughter has and can hope to have. I know many other people that kratom has helped in very significant ways. My sister who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and type II Diabetes has said the difference it has made in her hands (she is an artist) has allowed her to do her artwork after not being able to for many years.  Art has been a lifelong passion of hers and she had given it up because of her RA and now is able to create beautiful sculpters again. Please please please do not place this on a schedule I.  The thousands pf  people this has helped will have their lives devasted if they can no longer have access this most treasured of herbs.  \n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17851","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Deborah Blish","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've been using kratom for over 4 years.

Kratom has a long history of human use, which establishes it's safety. Not a single death can be attributed to kratom use alone. Turning kratom users into criminals will not benefit society. Kratom use is not associated with criminality. Placing kratom on the list of Controlled Substances would be irrational and would be a burden to law enforcement, the justice system, researchers, and kratom users. If kratom becomes a Controlled Substance it will force many kratom users to use opioids or to resort to suicide. Research into kratom would become much more difficult, and it's safety, efficacy, and medical properties would not be able to be adequately studied, if kratom was made a controlled substance. The DEA and the FDA do not have any objective evidence that kratom and it's chemical constituents pose a danger to health and safety, and therefore, I again urge you to leave kratom regulated as a dietary supplement, and to not control it as a Controlled Substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22841","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Pennsylvanians For Rational Drug Policy","postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ed Quiggle, Jr.","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am firmly against the scheduling of Kratom.\n\nI am not a drug user.

This is not happening right now... public opinion on kratom ranges from \"What's that?\" to \"That literally changed/saved my life.\"  The number of deaths that are 'linked' to kratom is laughable to anyone with a college-level statistics class.  \n\nI have done nothing wrong by availing myself of this natural form of pain relief.  You are not better than me because you use Advil instead... Or caffeine, for that matter.  The number of people killed by eating dishwasher detergent pods last year is much greater than the number (inconclusively) linked to kratom.  And hey ok.. folks are less likely to want to eat detergent pods so let's get away from the substance itself and talk about usage... You allow us to kill ourselves with alcohol and cigarettes, but you want to forbid us from the mild stimulant/pain reliever offered by kratom.  How in the world can you logically justify this ban?  \n\nI am not a criminal.  Please don't make me one.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5901","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Whitney Bell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI write because I am a kratom user who suffers from anxiety since I was a child, depression, and suicidal thoughts. After I graduated law school, my anxiety accelerated. A friend introduced me to kratom a year ago. I use half a teaspoon in a day to stay calm, focus, and be a productive asset to my job and to my family and friends. I use half a teaspoon at night to help me sleep and it has been more effective than drugstore pills which have side effects.  There are no side effects that I have experienced aside from nausea if I took too much kratom. You cannot overdose or die on kratom because your body will simply reject what it does not want in the form of vomiting. \n\nKratom has helped me foster better relations with my co-workers. Instead of allowing my anxiety and depression to control me and keep my in my cubicle, I am more likely to have healthy face-to-face conversations with people which positively impacts my work products. I feel like I can interact more easily with people. I have a healthier relationship with my family now because I am able to open up more instead of hiding inside my shell. \n\nThoughts of suicide are not as strong anymore. I feel like I have a place in society and a purpose and that's all because kratom keeps my mind calm enough so I can focus on what really matters. I don't focus and dwell on the negative thoughts that used to consume me.\n\nBefore kratom, I almost committed suicide when I was in law school.  The pressure was too much. I was already an anxiety-ridden person when I started law school and it got worse. I could not deal with the pressures my peers were okay dealing with. Kratom has changed my life since then.\n\nNow, I take a mild anxiety medicine, Buspirone, which is prescribed by my doctor. In conjunction with kratom, I feel like I have control over my brain. I have never felt more in control before this. \n\nThere are many students and young professionals like myself suffering with similar mental health issues and to take away the benefits kratom provides would deprive a lot of us of easy access to instant help when we need it. Taking away kratom also deprives the poor, who cannot afford to see a doctor for medication, access to this simple supplement. It would deprive people with chronic pains the ease of access to a harmless plant. \n\nWe do not use this herb for fun, recreational purposes. We use it because we need it and it makes a positive difference in our lives. Regulation of the kratom industry would be wonderful. However, a complete ban or a pharmaceutical take-over is extreme and uncalled for. My life was saved thanks to kratom. I fight to keep it legally over-the-counter.

When I feel like I want to drink, I take a teaspoon of kratom instead. When I feel pain, I take a teaspoon of kratom instead of an advil or Tylenol. When I need energy, I take a teaspoon of kratom instead of drinking an energy drink. My life has turned around since I started using kratom. Im more motivated and healthier than I have ever been.

I am 100% confident that simple research can prove this. Given the opiate epidemic in our country, it would be very irresponsible to not do the research first before making this decision. I believe if kratom is made illegal, it will have an immediate negitive impact on public health / our national opiate overdose statistics. To get an idea on the potential negative impact of the decision to schedule kratom, you can look no further than statistics of states which have made kratom illegal - whose rate of opiate overdoses has went up much more than normal. If you have been around an opiate addict who has been helped by kratom then you know that is a direct correlation and not a coincidence. I personally believe (and so do many others) that the number of opiate overdoses will skyrocket even higher in the U.S. if kratom is made illegal at the national level. I have seen kratom used with much success by opiate addicts as a safe alternative when matentance therapy is needed immediately, for example before finding a suboxone doctor (which can be a lengthly process sometimes), or in situations where the recovering addict is having difficulties getting on regular maintenance meds or maintaing their regular prescription for maintenance medication. Maintenance therapy is statistically the best chance an opiate addict has at beating the addiction to opiod medications and I believe that research would show that kratom is safe for theraputic maintence of addiction or even for maintenace of pain. I feel it's very irresponsible to make kratom illegal given that it is a non-dangerous subtance that simply provides theraputic maintenance for the many addicts struggling around the U.S. For instance, some users deal with pain or other similar triggers that seriously effect their quality of living and they simply cannot take normal opiate meds because that has the real potential to start a dangerous spiral of addiction for them. Also, in the event that the addict chooses to use a substance and there isn't a safe, theraputic substance like kratom to turn to then there is a very high likelyhood that they could turn to heroin or some substance that is much more dangerous instead. Also, regarding statistics on safety of substances, I have searched independently through datasets available through the poison control center call data and there is emperical evidence to show that kratom has less far less incidents than many over the counter medications and in cases where incidents were reported, the side effects of kratom were almost always reported to be \"very mild\" meaning not serious or in no way life threatening. In contrast to kratom, I think it should be considered that many simple substances such as \"tylenol\", or \"energy drinks\", or \"diet supplements\", or \"coffee\" (which are all deemed legal) show show a much higher rate of incident statistically with regard to ER visits or poision center calls and said incidents almost always carry along worse side effects and a significatly higher risk of use with regard to the seriousness of the side effects these OTC subtances have when taken improperly (again, in comparison to kratom). When I look at the benifits of kratom along with it's great record of the consumer easily being able taking a safe dosage versus the drastic consideration to just simply schdeule the substance as if it were dangerous... I start to worry that the sole incentive to schdule the substance is just based on greed being pulled at by the cogs in the patent system and I honestly worry that the overall public health of the U.S. with regard to opiate addiction is possibly not even being considered. Name brand companies can still profit without patents by selling kratom as a name brand supplment in pill form. A benificial plant doesn't need to be patented. At the very least, the growing opiate addiction issue should cause any scientific minded person to take notice and out of concern for the health of our nation's population consider that we should first do some research with kratom before just automatically making it schedule I. It's hard for me to believe that kratom is being considered dangerous without any actual research to back that claim. I hope that you will reconsider making kratom schedule I and do some research first before the significant opiate problem that our country faces grows even worse. I have see hope for the opiate crisis that our nation is facing in kratom... I've seen it with my own eyes... It is very useful and very safe. Please, let's not just discount it as some dangrous, illicit substance as a kneejerk reaction without any research similar to what happened with marijuana. We don't have to repeat history and keep making the same mistakes that we did almost a century ago. I would like to think that the scientific minded individuals and those who care about the health of the population have learned something over the past century.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9907","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mathew Tipton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has many medical benefits, many which help our soldiers deal with PTSD after coming back from war and those attempting to do away with the addictive properties of alcohol, heroin, and pain killers.

On Kratom I am more functional than I ever thought was possible. Today I am going to my job that allows me to support my family and make a huge difference in the lives of my patients. Later I will bring my girls to gymnastics practice and out to dinner. I love my little life. I am afraid I willl lose it all if Kratom  is criminalized. . I am terrified for my daughters who need a sober functional mama. Kratom saves lives.

I've been clean from heroin (and sober) since April 2013, and kratom, while not 100% essential to my recovery, has been a very helpful tool that helps with pain and sleeplessness without having to use dangerous and habit forming prescription, controlled substances such as opiates and benzodiazepines. If kratom becomes unavailable, my quality of life will greatly deteriorate, and I may be forced to talk to my doctor about alternatives that I left behind long ago.\nOne of the concerns noted by opponents is that the raw kratom could be \"laced with other dangerous substances,\" which I find an absurd concern. Rather, it's absurd to think that banning kratom will somehow address that concern. If someone is going to sell legal plant matter laced with dangerous chemicals, the fact that kratom might be that vehicle makes no difference. If you ban kratom, they'll just lace something else with whatever dangerous chemical they're trying to sell. You saw this with the synthetic cannabis; you don't ban the smokeable incense on which the dangerous chemicals are sprayed, you ban the dangerous chemical. This argument is a straw man that makes no sense (not to mention the fact that no one has shown this actually happening).\nI understand that everyone involved just wants to do what's best for everyone, and potentially locking people up for possessing a plant in the coffee family will do far more harm than good.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0053","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My time with Keaton, I felt relived of all stress and was able to feel free.

Almost five years now. I have severe upper back pain and it has made work very difficult for me. I used to take hydrocodone as prescribed for it for many years and it made the days blend together. They made me feel detached and not care much for anything. I found an article online about kratom and it really did save me as a person. Not only has kratom taken the edge off my pain but it has given me the motivation to want more for myself as a person and to seek a career for myself. I went from 10 years in the restaurant industry with no options for a middle class future to having a job for the largest beverage distribution company in idaho. I have become a very successful American and i have to pay my thanks to kratom. Every morning it curbs my back pain and motivates me for the day ahead. It helps me concentrate on my responsibilities instead of focusing on the pain. I know disabled men and women that work with my wife and she has helped them in a similar way. Nobody wants to be on drugs and kratom is the opportunity to do that... finally. Please let us keep this wonderful thing. With everything that is going on in our country right now please let us keep it. I honestly dont know if I could work without it and i have children and a wife that depend on me to support them and more than anything in the world i want them to have every opportunity as anyone else... thanks and i hooe this helps","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5932","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Seslar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have struggled for years with pain and anxiety and depression.

It is no secret that opiate addiction is an epidemic in this country, due to over prescription on the part of doctors and profiteering motives by the pharmaceutical industry. Kratom is a natural pain reliving alternative to opiate drugs and is available to individuals suffering from physical pain that are unable to afford health insurance. Criminalizing kratom would result in even more of an increase in heroine and prescription drug abuse and fill our already crowded for profit prisons with more nonviolent offenders.  It is important that our government recognize the failure of the war on drugs as well as the failure of prohibition that preceded it. Experts agree that drug abuse in this country would be far better handled if investments were made in rehabilitation treatment programs and Kratom is a healthier and safer alternative to opiate withdrawal drugs such as methadone and for that reason it should be researched and supported by our government.

I do use it daily,  and it helps me feel more comfortable and more social, however it does not make me disconnected,  \"out of it\" (like classic opioid medications do),  nor does it dull my emotions or make me feel fatigued like prescription anxiety medications do.  The best way for me to describe it is that it enhances my life.  It allowse to feel great but also feel completely myself and completely aware (I hate anything that makes me feel disconnected or out of control or takes away awareness). I also want to note that I perform my job duties successfully daily, as well as maintaining personal relationships in my life. Kratom does not in any way interfere with my daily life.

I would still be doing so, if I could.\n\nNow I am 70 years old and battling numerous difficult and life-threatening conditions.  Among them, I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, aka, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy.  It is known to be the most painful condition known to man.  \n\nIn the course of trying to find what would help my pain from CRPS, plus Neuroborreliosis (Late-Stage Neurological Lyme Disease), I tried Kratom for my pain.  It did help the pain.  No medications have been made for this severe pain, and no medications that I have tried have touched the pain; they only make me more out of it.\n\nKratom did help the pain, although, frankly, it isn't strong enough for that level of pain by itself.  Which explains why it is not dangerous, as the FDA may think it is.  I may return to using Kratom, along with other herbs or medications, in an effort to find relief safely and with fewer side-effects.  The medications that I do take, only at night, not only don't touch the pain much, but the side-effects are terrible, including gastroparesis, ie, paralysis of the GI system, which is intolerable.\n\nIn many decades of fighting these battles, I have found that natural remedies, like Kratom, are extremely important, even if not always sufficient by themselves.  I cannot tolerate the side-effects of the pain meds, or many meds for other symptoms, so the natural remedies can allow me to take less of the more difficult medications.\n\nKratom is not a dangerous herb in my experience, and to my knowledge.  It is a very helpful herb for many people.  As you surely know, there are many different strains, which help in different ways.  I've used several different strains, one for pain, one for energy, one for a little of each, and so on.  \n\nThere have been numerous safe natural remedies that have helped me enormously over the decades that the FDA have banned, leaving me, and millions of others, to suffer mercilessly.  Please, allow Kratom to remain legal, unscheduled, and able to be studied, and able to be used by people, like myself, who have no other good options, and are trying to live their lives as best as possible with the least side-effects.  \n\nIf the members of the FDA who are considering Kratom had to live with the kind of pain and suffering that myself, and millions of others do, perhaps they might understand our position.  Please consider that you, or someone you love, may be in a similar position at some point, and deserve to have the possibility of using an herb that causes no harm to help relieve their suffering, if they so choose.\n\nThank you very much for your consideration.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20360","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi my names Ethan and I've been taking Keaton on and off over the past 4 years.

I am also a recovering alcoholic. Unfortunately, in 2011 I had been in a 2 year long relapse that resulted in me being forcibly removed from the home I own and kept away from my husband and children. I was able to attend treatment at Serenity Lane and regain my life. Unfortunately, I suffer from back pain as well, and due to severe cravings to drink and wanting to appease my pain, I thought I would drink again and this time lose everything for good. I researched Kratom after I had heard about it from a friend in my AA meeting. I started using Kratom at the end of 2011 and have not had a craving to drink or take a narcotic pill from that day forward. I am happier than I've ever been.  Our beautiful family is in tact and flourishing, and I am present and available to them and for them. Mommy doesn't always \"have a headache\" anymore.

I am a 63-year-old college professor who lives and works in Tampa, FL. I have been using Kratom almost daily for three years and have nothing but praise for its analgesic and mood-enhancing effects. I credit Kratom for reducing my dependence on Ibuprofen to relieve back pain and for helping me quit antidepressants. Two years ago, I was set to retire because of health problems. Kratom has given me the relief and the stamina to continue in the classroom. I can now function pain free for two-hour, and even four-hour, class sessions. I have more energy to give my students, and I treat them with greater patience. \n\nI concede that more research needs to be done, but that research will be difficult if Kratom is reclassified as Schedule 1. Consider the impact on people like me who use Kratom responsibly to relieve pain, to increase stamina, and to diminish anxiety. In short, the beneficial effects of Kratom far outweigh the minimal risks posed.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17787","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Cohen","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom from becoming a schedule 1 narcotic.

My brother is in pain management due to severe back problems, my mother has had major back therapy, and my sister needs strong narcotics to help with her back.  Add on to that my wife also has severe back issues from her military time.  All of these people at some point have gotten addicted to pain medicines and most have gone down some fairly dark paths because of it.  Banning this substance will take these types of issues and multiply if by a million.  When people are in pain and overtake medicines either purposely or for relief they are put in a tight spot.  No one likes to be tortured but thats exactly what happens to everyone of these people!  Withdrawals is torture, not having pain meds for whatever reason is torture.  They can't win!  \n\nThis tree is a win for anyone who has tried it.  It takes the pain away just like pills, it cures withdrawal from pills and most importantly it allows many people to get on with their lives!   The very first time I saw my wife use this product she was crying in pain and in severe withdrawals due to the VA changing her doctor who thought it was a great idea to cut her medicine dosage in half because \"someone her age shouldn't' need such a high dosage\".  This decision was made without current X-rays, without any examination, nothing.   I found this tree by doing lots of research in ways to help that we could afford.  She was locked into care at the VA so seeing another doctor wasn't an option.  We did not want to buy pills off the street, we had finally gotten off that path almost a year ago, so at wits end we tried Kratom.   Within 30 minutes her crying had stopped, she was able to walk around the house without doubling over in pain!  She was able to tuck her kids in bed for the first time in a week!    The next day she returned to work, again, after being out for almost a week.  Now for us both kratom is a safe and effective product when pain fares up.  It's not a everyday pill.  She still has those, but I do not.  Yet I have no withdrawals from kratom like some say.  I do not get high like Percocet.  I live a normal life and take kratom the same way I took aleive or advil.  \n\nAside from all the above there are many small business that make a living by providing this product to other members including myself.  It has become a second job for me and a greatly needed income boost.  Yes I pay taxes on it just like my full time job.  From myself alone the following business would be affected:  USPS, $500-$800 weekly for shipping, DHL thousands a month, Food Lion/Sam's for packaging supplies, cleaning supplies, and storage containers.  My helpers would loose their part time jobs.  This product has a industry behind it, banning it would affect so many people in so many different ways.  \n\nPlease look at the big picture and not a few random news articles.  For every one person who has commented there will be a 100+ that do not.  \n\nI support regulating this product to 18+ which I truly believe 99% of our vendors already do.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6707","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"EC","postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"More research please.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16017","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Juan Garechana","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n I suffer with chronic nerve pain, a bulging 4L and narrowing 5L in my back, serve tinnitus and ptsd.

Our country already has an epidemic of opiate abuse and fatal overdose. Kratom can used to stem the tide of this epidemic, and in this writers view, the DEA should focus on the prescription opiate epidemic rather than jailing those who are likely attempting to rid themselves of prescription opiates.

The 3 years before this point had been miserable  I spent two getting over a debilitating addiction to ativan my doctor prescribed, and the next being jolted awake throughout the night by the RLS after I beat the addiction.

I developed a addiction to Loritabs because I have a chronic pain condition (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). It ruined my life but kratom saved it. The active alkaloid in Kratom is mitragynine & binds to the opiod receptors, so not only was I able to treat withdrawal  symptoms but I also found a safe alternative to Rx narcotics to treat my daily chronic pain. Kratom is not a drug, it is a plant that has been ingested my humans for hundreds of years. It is not intoxicating, not addictive, does not cause organ damage & most importantly you can't overdoes like so many americans have from Rx opiods & street heroin.

I originally had been heavily prescribed percocet for some chronic knee pain and surgeries. On top of that trazadone for anxiety. Once i found kratom, which was finally a natural substance rather than a drug which i was so excited about, I was able to get rid off all the non-sense. I was able to get off prescription drugs for both my anxiety and my pain. I have seen this result countless times, not only in the kratom community but within my own family. My own sister was out of control with everything from oxycontin to percocet to xanax trying to regulate her essentially broken back, as well as some emotional distress. After having such great success with Kratom, i decided to introduce it to her. Her life immediately turned around. She was able to remain employed and kicked the horrific vicious cycle of prescription meds that were ruining her marriage and her life.\n\n I am not going to pretend as if I know the scientific reasons behind kratom and why it is effective for people to get off drugs and regulate the pain and anxiety in their lives in a more natural and safe way. What I can tell you is I consider myself a very bright individual, someone who respects the role of laws and regulations to keep our citizens safe, and most of all I consider myself a loving brother who saw the best possible alternative come into my sister's life. I've seen or heard countless accounts of similar results within the kratom community, how can so many similar and positive experiences be discounted? Part of scientific study and research is experimentation and lab results as it relates to the subjects experience with the substance, be it positive or negative. Those results are in. Please make the responsible and justified decision on this. It has been such a positive influence in my life as well as the lives of many others. I would never advocate for someone to take Kratom that did not need help managing pain or anxiety but for those of us that do, taking this miracle tea away from us would be such a tragedy, not just for people who currently use it but for the peoples' lives it just might save in the future. Thank you very much for taking the time to ready my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1663","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ryan herrman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To those it may concern:\nI can not urge you strongly enough to not ban/schedule Kratom.

When I was 19 i was ejected from a car during a rollover car accident, I was severely injured including a broken hip and pelvis ribs cheekbone eye socket punctured lung lacerated kidney and liver just to name a few. I have spent the better part of the past 12 yrs on various pain meds all of which were making things worse with side effects and straining my damaged liver and kidney. My drs were no help at all they could only offer me pills, my husband found kratom online and told me to try it, i would have done anything to stop the pain. Kratom has changed my life i havent taken pills in a yr, im back to working full time 8 hrs a day on my feet pain free, i can play with my children pain free, clean my house pain free. I am TERRIFIED of having this taken from me! I dont want to go back on pills that were killing me and making me loopy, i just got back my life now to be threatened with losing it again and for what?! All of these side effects the dea claims are untrue, I've been taking kratom for a yr and never had any problems, now pills all i had were problems. I have lost multiple friends and even my own parents to pill addiction, i was killing myself slowly taking prescription drugs. My husband a U.S. army infantryman veteran who is 70% disabled moving to 100% by the end of this year also uses kratom for his multiple disabilities. He broke his foot in multiple places, it never healed properly as a result he has neuropathy, weak foot and constant pain. His drs just pushed prescription drugs to control his pain which then caused him to develop severe GERD. His GERD and continued prescription use caused him to lose weight so much weight that he was malnourished and started losing his hair. Kratom changed his life just like it did for me. He is back at a healthy weight, no longer in pain and going to college full time. Taking kratom from us will destroy our lives, i would no longer be able to work 8 hrs a day on my feet or care for my family, i will be forced back on pills that were killing me slowly, my husband will be forced back on pills that were destroying his body, he may have to drop out of school. These claims that kratom kills people are unfounded, every death linked to kratom involved other drugs used in conjunction with kratom. The claims of disorientation and hallucinations are completely untrue, i wouldnt be able to work if it were true. Pills on the other hand cause nothing but side effects, i recently was forced to use pills for pain because i was out of kratom, i was incoherent and loopy and suffered from severe depression and head aches from it, i was tired and moody because of it. We are law biding citizens and will continue to be, we wont break the law if this ban goes through but we will be forced back on pills and that wont help our situations and will harm our health and livelihood. I pray that this ban does not happen because it will only hurt people like myself and my husband, and unlike us not everyone will follow the laws and may take to using harder drugs, its not a coincidence that opiate deaths doubled in Alabama after kratom was made illegal.Its not addictive, its not an opiate, there are no deaths directly caused by kratom, the number of poison control calls are nothing compared to calls about children eating laundry detergent pods!

I have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and other illnesses which accompany autoimmune diseases, and have been in pain management for just over 20 years as a result. Each time my husband received a Permanent Change of Station, I was forced to start over with a brand new set of physicians who neither knew me, nor trusted me, so I ended up, on average, going without my medications for 4-6 months after each move. I am not a drug addict - I have never taken an illegal drug, taken a prescription contrary to its instructions, nor ever even smoked a single cigarette in my 42 years, however, I have had a dependency on opiate pain medication due to the number of years I have been on them, so you can imagine how many times I have experienced withdrawal because of moving from state to state while my husband served his country. In 2014, we were stationed in Texas. My withdrawal symptoms were particularly lengthy that time because it was more difficult than usual to get a timely appointment with a primary care doctor in order to get a referral to a pain doctor, so I checked around for LEGAL ways to abate my symptoms. I stumbled upon Kratom, and it not only alleviated my withdrawal symptoms, it also helped get my excruciating pain under control. I took it until I was able to get my pain medicine, then stored away what I had not used. My husband retired this past June, and we moved back to Florida. My first primary care doctor here not only refused to refer me to a pain doctor, but refused to prescribe a single one of the medications I rely on to keep my Lupus and RA symptoms at bay. Suddenly stopping ANY of my medicines can cause a flare up and potentially put me in the hospital. I am now back on Kratom while I await an appointment with a new doctor who will prescribe my maintenance meds and refer me to the specialists I need. The fact of the matter is that Kratom is helping take care of people who cannot afford the expense of a doctor AND medication, do not want to take opiates, or find themselves in situations like mine. It is also a fact that acetaminophen hurts and kills more people each year than Kratom EVER HAS, yet it is still sold over the counter like candy. Meanwhile, marijuana becomes legal in state after state...a drug known to cause addiction and make people high. I never want to have to take marijuana and at this point, I am deciding if I ever want to go back on opiates for my pain. As long as Kratom is legal and my doctors approve, I may keep taking it along with my autoimmune disease meds, but if you make it a crime to have it, I will have to continue taking opiates, which I will become dependent on again and have to continue to increase the dosage to keep the pain at bay. I appreciate you taking the time to read about me and for your consideration of keeping Kratom legal. Please contact me should you have questions or need verification of my medical history.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8123","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Castaldo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I know someone who has used kratom, which is now illegal.

I have been chronically ill since I was born. I have taken pretty much every pharmaceutical Med known to man, and unfortunately I'm allergic to most of them including penicillins and opiates. I have also struggled with chronic dysmenorrhea since the age of fifteen so about 17 or 18 years now which causes extreme pain that makes me miss work or school at least one or two days out of every month no matter what I do. Unfortunately comma because of my allergies and other issues traditional pharmaceutical medicines have failed me. I never thought I could be grateful for an opiate allergy until my friends in high school started experimenting with them and I went to six funerals in as many years due to losing people under the age of 25 to opiates comma including one who was trying to get off heroin and was on methadone when he died. Every 19 minutes we lose someone to addiction. Imagine having chronic pain that is always there your whole life. How do you deal with that safely? I've already blown through enough NSAIDs and Tylenol that I'm surprised I don't need new internal organs by now. Randomly a few years ago I discovered kratom. This plant has changed my life! There are a whole world of herbs and plants out there that I experiment with and that I use for all of my symptoms, but Kratom and cannabis are the two that help with all my symptoms my most debilitating pain and they're not addictive and they don't kill people. I Come From A Home of Alcoholics and addiction. I have never seen anyone get high off of cannabis or Kratom and beat their kids or pass out and fall asleep in the bathtub with a needle in their arm. I am very frustrated with the lack of options that are offered to us the American citizens who deserve the right to happiness and freedom from Pain and other symptoms. I personally feel that we should be given all options under safe supervision of course and I wish the FDA would get off their lazy asses and start testing this plant properly so that we can use it properly. I'm also tired of these three-letter bureaucracies not getting along with each other and not getting things done. Remember who you work for and remember what you are supposed to be doing. You are supposed to be serving the public. Currently you are dismal failing us and I look forward to the day that we can make progress and people who struggle with chronic issues like PTSD and pain are offered more than just addictive and dangerous pills that don't even really work half the time. We don't have to have this epidemic continue comma and you can help stop it. We the people demand it. We your citizens have spoken. Remember the Hippocratic Oath. Remember that this country was founded on plants like hemp and cannabis. And remember that we are getting sick and tired of you all getting paid off by lobbyists to keep these things the way that they are and we want change and we want it now!

I was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease (One of the more well-known diseases in this group, Lupus, is just one I suffer symptoms from).  For over the past 2 years I have been prescribed a few different pain medications, all of which had dramatic side effects that caused various issues on a daily basis. Tramadol made me feel as if I could fall asleep at a stoplight and had brain fog all day long. It made it very hard to remember tasks at work and I became very demotivated. Hydrocodone, was next and while it helped more with the pain,  it had numerous negative side effects and was extremely hard to get in my area at many  pharmacies with my prescription.  I had to visit my doctor every month to get my prescription and would not be able to fill it until the day it was to run out. Every month I was faced with pharmacies that were out of stock and would have to take the prescription to anywhere from 3 to 5 pharmacies to get my medication, otherwise I knew the next day would be hell. Through a great amount of research on natural pain alternatives (Tumeric, St. John's Wort, Cinnimon, and the list goes on) I finally discovered Kratom and everything changed. I was able to completely stop taking the Hydrocodone without withdrawal symptoms or other side affects. All of the sudden my brain fog has lifted, I was happier on a daily basis and it managed my pain far better than anything I had been prescribed. Additionally, to my doctor's surprise, my blood pressure consistently began to go down. My rheumatologist took me off of the pain medication and suggested I continue on the Kratom while he did some more research.  He stated he had heard great things about it from other patients and that it had been very helpful to several. \n\nI would be faced with a 3 week wait to see my doctor to discuss what options I have if Kratom is taken away. My husband, and my children can attest to the fact this miracle plant has made me a happier, more productive and even healthier person.  I am fearful of what may come of my life again if forced to go back on these miserable drugs or anything stronger. \n\nI  strongly urge you not to schedule this natural plant making it virtually impossible for expedient and helpful research to be done. Any move to schedule this plant will  negatively impact many Americans including myself.

Given its minimal observable side effects, weak withdrawal effects, and ability to curb opioid addiction, kratom does not appear to be a danger to public health or be easily misused. As the citizens of the United States reveal more adamantly their opposition to mass incarceration, their distrust of the failed War On Drugs (which is largely a war on people of color and leftist speech, by the admission of a former Nixon cabinet member), and the very real problem of pharmaceutical opioid addiction, this proposed ban appears to be little more than a solution seeking a problem. The DEA could, and should, better utilize its resources by pursuing known public health hazards such as commercial opioids, and go after the companies that market them aggressively and improperly, than to vilify the users of a substance which is relatively harmless and actually helps counter an addiction epidemic.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21002","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Richard Moore","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 33 year old mother, wife,  and Veterinary technician that drinks kratom tea. I do not think kratom should  be scheduled as a drug, especially in the same category as heroin.  I suffer from bipolar 2, generalized anxiety disorder, and severe depression. Before I found kratom I was on many different prescribed medications. Xanax, Valium, kolonopin, depakote, lithium, effexor, and lexapro to name a few. These medications helped for a small time but I was increasingly drowsy and constantly in a fog. In time I grew acclimated to the drugs with no real relief from my symptoms  and was prescribed a higher dose of each.  That's when I knew I had to change something. I researched heavily into natural herbal remedies for my symptoms and stumbled across kratom. I found a list of accredited vendors and placed my order. During this time I was slowly weaning myself off of my prescription medicines at a safe and manageable taper. When I received my herbs I proceeded to infiltrate the tea into my daily regimen and was pleased with the results.  Upon consumption there is not a \"high\" so to speak. It is a mild stimulating effect not unlike coffee.  What I did notice after a few weeks was an increasingly \"at peace\" or \"balanced\" effect. I no longer require my prescription drugs to make me feel better. This in itself is a freedom. I am a much better parent and wife, no longer suffereing from extreme bouts of depression and anxiety.  A better employee with more focus and energy. A better human not reliant on doctors and pharmaceuticals.

Banning it would be an act of great inconsideration. It would ruin the DEA's credibility with many and hang many honest hard working Americans out to dry. Please don't criminalize a gift to all of us in chronic pain that do not wish to be enslaved by opiod dependency. I urge the DEA to understand our plight. The opioid addiction crisis in this country will only worsen if kratom is banned. I have faith that you will do the right thing for the American people. I as a fellow law enforcement agent feel confident in your further judgement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21535","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a life saver for me.I haven't been this physically and mentally stable in years.Kratom has made me more of the person I was hoping to be/become.I am no longer dependent on opiates, because of kratom.Kratom not only helps me with chronic back/ hip pain, but my anxiety is also a thing of the past.I no longer crave opiates and it's addictive nature.This is all due to my taking of kratom.

The first thing the doctors did was put me on heavy narcotics. I refused to be another victim of addiction and chose to go the natural route for my pain treatment. I own a Automotice dealership and need to stay alert and focused. Kratom has helped me with pain management, but more importantly it has helped me be able to function without the dreaded side effects of terrible narcotic drugs. Kratom is NOT a drug. It's is a all natural way to help alleviate pain without the addictive qualities of narcotics. I know this for a fact, for example yesterday I woke up and was busy all day and forgot to take the small amount that I normally take with my coffee. Ask an addict if he has ever forgot to take his narcotic when it was sitting his closet. It wouldn't happen, because narcotics are terribly addictive. Kratom should absolutely remain legal. This is coming from a sober addict of 4 years. Kratom saved my life, my 4 kids life with their Dad, and my business as well as the 4 employees who I support.

I have tried all available traditional treatments, including over- the-counter and prescription medications, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage, cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, and surgery. Many therapies like massage and physical therapy are no longer covered by my medical insurance and are very expensive to continue. I am also allergic to most medications that might improve my quality of life. I am permanently disabled by chronic pain, poor sleep, unrelenting fatigue and increasingly limited mobility. \nI decided to try Kratom two weeks ago and I'm happy to report that it does indeed relieve my pain and fatigue and has helped my sleep quality improve. It's inexpensive in comparison to other options and has fewer side effects. The only side effect I have noticed is minor constipation which is easy to treat. It improved my mood and reduced my pain as effectively as most prescribed medications which, I can no longer tolerate. After taking the Kratom, I have also increased my level of activity.\nBased on my personal experience and the testimonials I have read by other individuals, I would highly recommend this supplement to anyone who is interested in managing their pain and improving their quality-of-life. This is not a dangerous substance when used appropriately. I think it would be a grievous error to ban this useful supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2937","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wendy Scott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

To do so would be premature and risky. Placing substances under schedule I makes it very difficult to study them (as a researcher I am especially sensitive to this). No strong scientific evidence exists to support banning kratom at this time. While the health benefits are similarly understudied, the identifiable potential harm from banning it outweighs the unknown, unspecified benefit.\n\nWhat we do know is that kratom overdoses are rare to nonexistent, but that many consumers of kratom find major health benefits. Perhaps the most critical and well-known is its use as an opiod-addiction treatment. Opiod addiction is one of the most pressing health concerns in the US, killing some 47,000 people a year. Millions of kratom users might relapse if kratom is banned, and go back to using heroin, oxycodone, etc. And if they don't die of an overdose, their lives will certainly suffer as a result. If it is put into schedule I, then the kratom market will be driven underground. The cost will rise, and people will find what was a cost-effective remedy to be an extremely expensive medication--more expensive than cheaper alternatives, like prevalent opiods. Not only that, they will inadvertantly become criminals. And criminal sanctions may continue to deteriorate their lives, by disrupting their family life, careers, and finances.\n\nIn addition to combating substance addiction, millions of kratom users have found it useful for combating psychological disorders. Its mood-lifting and calming properties make it a powerful anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication. It is especially popular among people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. To deprive these suffering people of a useful medicine is cruel. Many of these people had tried other medications (e.g., SSRIs) to no avail, but kratom helped change their lives for the better. Its stimulant properties also help people suffering from chronic fatigue.\n\nWhile the desire to prevent people becoming addicted to a potentially harmful drug is noble, it is ironic because many of the people who use kratom to manage chronic pain do so precisely because they do not want to become addicted to opiods. Many find that their tolerance does not grow as quickly, it is less addictive, and the side effects are much less severe than those arising from habitual opiod use.\n\nWhile to date evidence about the pros and cons of kratom is largely anecdotal, the vast majority is positive. The desire to ban it, meanwhile, is based almost entirely on speculation. I suspect it is largely due to political motivations, rather than health ones. Politicians face incentives to scare concerned parents and claim credit for preventing health epidemics. In addition, the pharmaceutical industry--especially those in the business of making anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, opiod-based pain killers, and opiod-addiction treatment drugs--faces incentives to ban the plant's sale. In this instance, the goals of lobbyists and politicians are at odds with promoting public health, and should not be allowed to determine the legality of the herb.\n\nI am diagnosed with bipolar depression and generalized anxiety disorder. For a long time I self-medicated with marijuana. I broke that addiction only to fall into alcoholism. All the while I've tried a host of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-anxiety drugs. While they have helped, I've found kratom to be the safest and most effective remedy. I have not experienced the multitudinous side effects I did from the other drugs, and I've had much more energy and inner peace since using kratom. I know other people who have had the same experience, including a family member of mine. I fear that I might personally relapse into marijuana or alcohol abuse, and potentially end up in a psychiatric ward and/or self-harm. Resultant major depressive episodes would likely harm my progress in my graduate degree program, and hurt my interpersonal relationships.\n\nIn sum, I beseech the Drug Enforcement Administration NOT to place Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I, as it will 1) seriously curtail necessary research into the drug's potential harms and benefits; 2) potentially worsen the opiod epidemic in the country, leading to more deaths and societal costs; 3) prevent many people suffering from a host of diseases from the relief they deserve; 4) add strain to our already overburdened justice system and overcrowded jails; and 5) reduce work productivity, thus harming the fragile economic recovery. While regulations may be a good thing, at the moment an all-out ban would be detrimental to society. The human and economic costs could be devastating. While the DEA is calling this scheduling temporary, the fact is that schedules are quite sticky; once a substance is scheduled, its class is very rarely changed. Indeed, its having been scheduled as class I might be used as evidence to keep it there.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17343","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachary O'Keeffe","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":" I strongly oppose a ban on kratom and feel that it should not become a scheduled drug in any way.

I had a hairline fracture in one of my vertebrates after spending some time in the hospital the doctor prescribed me Hydro-morphine and let me go home. While I was at home I was taking the pills as prescribed but yet the pain wasn't going away so I kept taking more pills to manage my pain, 3 months later I was taking 5 times more than prescribed to me and that's when I realized I have developed an addiction to pills. I tried stopping taking the pills but I quickly realized that I was unable to do so, my addiction was getting worse and worse. 3 more months later I was shooting heroin and full blown junkie. How did this happen? I went from being normal human being not even drinking alcohol to full blown junkie in 6 months and its all because a doctor prescribed me pills without any care. This addiction went on for 2 years during that time I lost my wife, my kids, my family, my friends, my job, and my home (I was living on the streets). I contemplated killing myself and just ending all of my pain and suffering. On October 30th 2015 I met an ex heroin addict and he told me about this \"miracle\" herb called kratom. At that point I had nothing to loose, we met the next day and he gave me kratom to try and boy did that change my life. After taking kratom I noticed that I didn't get the craving to heroin and that was the first day in 2 years where I didn't use any heroin or opiates. 1 day turned to 3 days, 3 days turned to 10 days and 10 days turned to 1 full year of being clean and sober. \n\nFor the first 4 weeks I was using kratom once or sometimes twice a day to eliminate the craving to heroin, after 4 weeks I was taking kratom every other day, after 3 months I was taking kratom about once a week and now I take kratom about once or twice a month as a \"maintenance\" if I get a craving to heroin. I am a recovering addict and I will always have craving to heroin and if I don't have something to help me cope with my craving then I am scared to relapse and get back to my old life. I truly can say that kratom has saved my life!!!! I am working on getting my wife, kids and family back. If you do take kratom away from people you will have a lot good people relapse because as an ex addict I use kratom as a supplement to help me with my cravings, I don't use it everyday, I use it once or twice a month. You don't get euphoria, you cant get high from kratom nor do you get addicted to kratom. Tobacco and alcohol has killed millions of Americans yet its still legal.\n\nPlease I am begging you DO NOT TAKE THIS AWAY FROM US!!!!\n\nThank you for giving me a chance to speak and I trust that you will  make a right decision.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21492","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carmine Angelo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Let's do some studies before we make it a schedule 1.

I hated the the way they made me feel so I didn't always take them, leaving me in agony. On the days I did it was not much better as I was unmotivated. Kratom has given me my life back. It has truly revitalized my entire being. I am a happier healthier person as a result of this miraculous plant. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21651","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"C.

I have been on numerous pain meds and anti-inflammatories for over a year. They all come with awful side effects in my digestive tract and stomach. I also was confined to the house while taking pain meds because I couldn't drive or care even for my own children because my state of mind was altered. I started using kratom just a month ago after someone in my Spondylosis Support group said she was taking it with great results. I am an occasional babysitter and I was worried about the side effects that kratom would have because I knew very little about it. So on a weekend when I was not working, I tried kratom for the very first time and that day was the first day I had been pain free in over a year. I was never into 'natural' remedies nor did I like to take many medications but I was so happy when I found kratom. I don't take it everyday, I mainly take it in the mornings on days where I will be quite active and I also take it in the evening on days that are more painful for me. \nIt took me a little while to get used to telling people or family members and my parents of the children I care for that I was taking kratom. I know that kratom has helped so many people with chronic pain so the stigma shouldn't be for this plant to be considered a dangerous drug. I am able to drive a car and work with my children I care for which is something I CANNOT do on pain meds. I would like to plead with you to keep this plant and all of it's parts legal and plead with you to NOT make it a schedule 1 drug. Kratom has changed my quality of life. I wish for kratom to be available to everyone battling chronic pain diseases and health issues. Thank you for listening to me.\nSincerely\nJennifer Lynne June","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19190","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer June","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, \nI do not believe that kratom in its natural form is a danger to people.

I also think it is wonderful that some individuals who are trying to conquer an opiate addiction can use this as a natural supplement.

Prohibiting Kratom and it's derivatives through the DEA will absolutely hurt the public good. There is anecdotal evidence that these molecules can help people reduce their opiate intake. Given the outrageous rate of opiate overdoses in our country researchers need to be free to pursue any path that may reduce this plague. Prohibition limits research opportunities and harms the public good, especially since there is ample evidence that prohibition of controlled substances does not affect their usage rates and only leads to more dangerous avenues for people to acquire drugs.

I work hard to provide for my family and give them a better life.  I am opposed to the ban on Kratom.\n\nAbout 5 years ago my body started to reject certain foods.  I started to suffer from severe gastro-intestinal distress, including gas, diarrhea and bloating.  I discovered from my doctor and through blood testing that I was allergic to certain proteins and could no longer eat the foods which contained them.  Foods such as dairy, eggs, beef, chocolate, bananas, grains, tree nuts, etc.  This all happened very quickly and I had no other choice but to avoid those foods, but even so, many foods contain traces of the proteins found in those foods and I would have very bad bouts of gastro-intestinal distress.  I tried many different treatments, including: probiotics, enzymes, homeopathic remedies and other natural or prescription treatments.  Nothing worked.  My quality of life degraded severely.  Our food budget skyrocketed due to having to use alternative foods.  My wife spent much more time in the kitchen preparing foods that I was able to eat and ensuring that she did not cross-contaminate my food with her or the kids food.  I was unable to simply eat out with my family and friends or take clients out to lunch or dinner, because the foods I am allergic to are in the majority of all restaurant dishes.  If I happened to eat cross-contaminated food, or not pay attention close enough or realize there was a certain food in a meal, box, etc, I would later suffer the consequences.  I can remember the pain and distress clearly, curled up on the floor clutching my stomach, sitting on the toilet for long periods of time, holding in painful gas while in public or having to find a private place to relieve myself.  Thinking about those times now feels like a nightmare and to go back to that lifestyle terrifies me very much.\n\nAbout three years ago, I began researching on the internet, and stumbled upon an online forum where people were discussing success with their colitis and other gastro-intestinal issues using Kratom.  Some said it suppressed much of their diarrhea and was able to, for the most part, live a fairly normal life.  So, I began to do more research about where to get it, how to and how much to use and began supplimenting with Kratom.  \n\nFrom that moment on, I could eat anything I want with little to no consequences.  I spoke to my doctor to ask him if he thought that it was harmful due to it simply suppressing the issue, and possibly still causing inflammation.  In my case, he said that if it works to keep the symptoms at bay, then to keep doing what I was doing as there should be no long term adverse affects from eating foods I'm allergic to.\n\nI also reap other benefits of Kratom.  I have chronic whiplash, something I have been dealing with for over 10 years.  I rarely have to take prescription pain medication, ibuprofen, acetaminophen or other pain medications to curb my neck and back pain.  Unknown to me at the time, that Kratom helped with pain control.  Now I rarely go to the chiropractor, whereas in the past, I would see one 3 or more times a month.\n\nI do not become impaired, physically or mentally, while using Kratom.  I take a consistent amount, just enough to tide my allergies.\n\nThe thought of the government banning Kratom terrifies me.  To go back to living the way I was before I discovered Kratom will completely degrade my quality of life again.  I believe the government should keep Kratom legal so that we may explore and test the benefits and detriments of Kratom use.  The illegalization of Kratom seems like a rash approach to dealing with a botanical suppliment that has many positive benefits with very little evidence of its harm.\n\nI hope the DEA will consider all that has been said and choose to keep Kratom legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16310","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zachery Kreiss","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am married to someone who suffered from opiate addiction for 4 years.

I have taken 2 teaspoons of kratom leaf powder with my vitamin regimen, every day, for 3 years. I am a productive member of society I am not a stoner or a hippie, as the DEA would like to believe.\nI take kratom because it seems to help relieve the cluster migraines I use to experience after being involved in a rear-end collision 3 years ago. I received head trauma from the accident and my GP (General Physician) wanted to put me on Oxycontin as a 'solution' to my cluster migraines. \nThis was never going to happen for me. I refuse to believe that pain medication does anything more than create addiction if used for long-term care. So I went back home and did my own research to find a 'solution'. I learned of kratom through a knowledgeable online community (the community was actually established for people with Lyme Disease). After taking my first teaspoon of kratom leaf powder I received relief of my migraines within an hour. I am not claiming that kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) cures, prevents or treats ANY disease or illness, but I do know that helped me feel a bit better. And because of this I have continued to use kratom daily. I have quit using kratom several times over the past 3 years, generally because I ran out of the leaf powder or forgot to re-order on time. But my point is that I have never had 'withdrawal' symptoms from NOT taking the kratom powder, even as a regular kratom consumer. I have heard the media & the DEA/FDA try to claim that Kratom is \"highly addictive and has no medicinal value'. I have never heard of something so misrepresented in my life. I am here to say that kratom does help with mild pain relief, just like an NSAID pain reliever. It has never given me any type of 'euphoria' or 'high'. Kratom powder does help me to live comfortably and normally without the fear of being an addict for the rest of my life, or worrying about falling asleep and not waking up due to Oxycontin. \nI am thankful that the DEA/FDA has offered us a comment period. It is just. But I would like to see the DEA/FDA make Kratom LEGAL in our country. Other places such as Europe and Canada have made kratom legal to help its population flourish without opiates. We as Americans do have the right to choose our healthcare. If we choose natural solutions over prescriptions, then this is our God-given right as Americans. The opiate epidemic is overwhelming our country and to even attempt to make a plant, this beneficial, illegal is an outrage. \nKratom, in its original plant-form, can help millions everyday- and to take this plant away would be a travesty.Even to take this plant away in order to make a prescribable medication would be an even greater travesty. God gave us this plant. And to take it away from millions of people just to alter it into a drug so that Americans without health insurance (like myself) won't have access to it, well, this would alter the course of the American opiate epidemic. A downhill spiral of thousands of Americans dying from opiate overdoses for No Reason At All.  \nPlease see all the good that Kratom does. I am sorry if 15 people died with kratom in their bloodstream over the past 5 years. I feel for their families. But what about the thousands of Americans that overdose weekly from opiates prescribed by Doctors? What about the thousands that die yearly from Asprin overdose? The list goes on and on. There is no real reason to make kratom illegal. The facts are readily available. I am writing purely out of opinion. I know that you will receive the 8-Point analysis and all of the other info provided by the AKA, BEA & DPA. I am just here to say that losing kratom would be a devastating awakening regarding the current opiate epidemic.

I oppose the DEA's proposal to put kratom, the plant from which it is derived, or either of the two alkaloids mitragynine or 7-hydroxymitragynine (the active compounds in kratom) on the list of schedule I controlled substances.\n\nI used kratom daily for about 6 months during my time in graduate school, and I have not resumed use at any point after my graduation 6 months ago. During my two years of graduate school, I fell into a deep depression that manifested in extreme lethargy, panic attacks, and suicidal thoughts. I sought treatment through antidepressants and therapy prescribed by my psychiatrist, but was still struggling to overcome many of the worst symptoms. I began to use marijuana against my better judgment to cope with my problems. This use began to interfere with my research and school work, almost to the same level that my depression had interfered before I began using marijuana. I sought treatment in herbal supplements to help me regain functionality, and I encountered kratom. The mental, emotional, and physical boost it gave me allowed me to stop using marijuana and get back to my work. By consuming a small amount of kratom every morning with my tea, I was able to pick up the pace on my thesis and complete on time, and I no longer felt consumed by my depression. Once I graduated and left Rochester, all of the stress of graduate school lifted from me, and I no longer needed to use kratom. I was able to stop by choice. I have been free of marijuana and have not used kratom for 6 months, and I feel I am living a happy life.\n\nI have heard far too many success stories similar to mine to count. I implore you to allow this herbal supplement to continue to be accessible, not for the sake of myself, but for the sake of others who could benefit. Putting kratom on the list of schedule I controlled substances would not affect me in any way because I no longer use it, but I am concerned for the millions of others who are currently or will in the future see the same benefits that I have. Please do not deny those who are ill an avenue of treatment. Our list of options for treating depression and addiction is tragically short as it is.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20329","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jean Fecteau","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI believe there needs to be further research to verify the safety of this drug.

This plant has been used for centuries in other countries. The only \"kratom\" related deaths were not due to kratom at all, but adulterated substances.

It didn't give me the horrible side effects that painkillers gave me and allows me to still feel completely lucid and take care of my children. I have now been drinking kratom tea for 6 months and it has helped me to live a normal life.  And when I feel good I don't drink it and it is no problem to go long periods without it. I feel strongly that kratom allows me to lead a normal life, play with my kids, drive and participate in activities. I have experienced opioids and I will never again use them to help my condition.

I am typically someone who avoids pharmaceutical drugs and painkillers, so when I learned that kratom has natural pain killing qualities and was legal to buy, I tried it. Not only has kratom been the only thing to help me with my chronic leg pain, it also helps me with daily anxiety and stress management. I have never experienced any negative side effects from kratom after being a regular user for over a year. I use it as needed, just as I would use a prescription drug. Kratom keeps me out of the doctor's office, and has been an extremely reliable source of relief when I am in pain or experiencing a panic attack. In addition, I have also found that kratom is the first and only legal substance that has been unbelievably, amazingly great for menstrual cramps. Before I discovered kratom, I would be in so much pain and so sick that I would have to call out of work almost every month. I have not called out of work once for any pain related reason since I started taking kratom. \nKratom is an incredible tool in my life, which I hope will not be taken away from me as I truly  don't know what I will do without it. It is much less harmful than any legal pharmaceutical on the market, and should remain accessible for the people like me who experience tremendous help and relief from it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7771","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Zoe Ader","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please consider the impact, keep Kratom free from getting scheduled as a reserved drug, when it is used as a symptom relief for so many in need.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11254","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Victoria Mendez","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As a former kick-boxer and martial arts teacher and an electrician I have abused my body with hard work and trauma since the age of 8.

I'm only 40! I have been allergic to aspirin my whole live so the only thing over the counter that I can take is tylenol which, over time kills my liver and does virtually nothing for the pain.

I was diagnosed with RSD after an on the job injury in 2003. While I was on insurance they threw all sorts of treatments my way that were ineffective and dangerous. After spending 5 years trying to manage my pain condition and finding no relief I found myself with no insurance and unable to afford treatment. So my search for something natural to treat my condition began in earnest. Cannabis provided me some relief but nothing touched the unrelenting nerve pain and my depression grew to the point of being suicidal. A friend told me about kratom so I researched it for about 6 months before trying it. That was 3 years ago now. 30 minutes after trying kratom my nerve pain receded for the first time since my injury. Where before there was only hopelessness and despair now I saw light. I wasn't expecting that my life would improve so dramatically. Before kratom I spent a lot of time curled up in a ball wishing for death. With kratom, not only does it help with my pain, but the muscle spams, insomnia,depression, anxiety, fatigue and improved overall health. I'm still unable to work due to my health but I can now garden and help provide for my family by growing some of our food. I'm able to care for our home better. I can be a bigger part in my kids and grand kids lives. With kratom I found hope and a better quality of life. And I feel safe that I don't have medicines around that could harm my family. I have personally seen it help others regain their life by beating addictions, controlling pain from chronic diseases, mood support for depression, anxiety and PTSD. With kratom there is hope for a future not without pain, RSD is incurable, but a future of my symptoms of this nasty disease being manageable. And the thought of losing that light and hope that kratom provides me is terrifying. The thought that a plant that helped and continues to help so many people could be taken away when there is substantial evidence in favor of its safety and effectiveness in treatment of so many conditions it would be an injustice and infringement on our rights to use plant medicine as we have since the dawn of man. I tried pharmaceuticals and there's about 2 1/2 years of my life that I can't remember much about because of how drugged up my meds made me. With kratom I am clear-headed and able to cope with my disease and hold on hope for a better tomorrow. To be able to be a part of my families lives and to support my husband in starting to build a new business. 6 1/2 years ago we were homeless and hopeless. In the last 3 years with kratom our lives are continually improving and I fear what the loss of kratom will bring. Please don't let this happen. Kratom helped save me and my family and restored my hope about living with this condition. Kratom is ONLY thing that helps my nerve pain. Kratom and cannabis are the plant medicines that works best for me without harming my family or myself. Don't take that away from us. My doctors are aware that I take kratom and cannabis and are totally supportive of it. My doctor said the difference it has made for me is amazing and to keep doing what I'm doing. I don't have to have blood work done every 3 months anymore to monitor my kidneys and liver and cortisol levels. My blood work looks healthy.  And if I run out my symptoms return but I don't experience ANY withdrawal. If you take too much you puke so you can't OD on it. And with the number of OD deaths at an all time high the pulling of kratom from the market will cause that number to rise as it helps fight addiction. The research is there for you to read. Kratom is safe and effective and shouldn't be made a Schedule 1 substance. It's medicinal value is clear to see if you take the time to research for yourself. I did mine and my only regret about kratom is not trying it sooner! It made a life-changing difference in my quality of life and I don't want to lose that. I will never go back to pharmaceuticals. I am a patient not a criminal. The vendors I use for kratom are safe and provide good quality kratom at an affordable price. If kratom is banned who knows what you would get on the black market. This ban will block a invaluable plant medicine from improving countless lives. And make criminals out of ordinary law-abiding citizens just trying to mange their health naturally.  Thank you for your consideration on this matter and I hope you will help stop this ban.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12034","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tammie Wheeler","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"While I've never used Kratom, as a cannabis user, I believe that people have an inalienable right to do what they want to their bodies as long as it doesn't harm others.  Indeed, we don't even know that this herb does any damage to the person imbibing it.  And don't we have a fundamental philosophy in our country of innocence until proven guilty.  I believe that this concept should be applied to other things besides people.\n\nConversely. we have legal drugs in our country that are undeniably detrimental to our health.  Both cigarettes and sugar are highly addictive and slowly kill us, yet these substances are completely legal.  Why aren't they schedule 1?  Everyone knows that you can overdose on alcohol, ALCOHOL POISONING KILLS 6 PEOPLE EVERY DAY! (www.cnn.com/2015/01/07/health/alcohol-poisoning-deaths/index.html).  How many people even supposedly died from Kratom?  An allegation that hasn't even been proven.\n\nI've heard that this herb can be helpful for people trying to get off an Opioid addiction.  In the state the country is in, we cannot afford to outlaw any herb that may help people with this issue.  As someone who is currently addicted to prescribed Remeron, who has been trying since the beginning of summer to wean myself off it and still haven't managed to go completely off of it.  Remeron, I was using cannabis before as medication for my depression but got tired of being scared of doing something illegal so I decided to switch to a legal, prescribed drug.  It was one of the worst decisions of my life.  The doctor, my acting GP, wanted me to see him every month to get my refill.  If I didn't go in I would be basically immobile, huddled in the fetal position suffering from withdrawal, forcing me to go see him for more.  When did doctors start feeling like drug dealers/pushers?  When did herbal remedies which can be grown at home in a garden become illegal while prescription drugs with their paragraphs of side-effects and proven addictiveness are not only legal, but advertised and pushed upon the population.  \n\nI have great sympathy for anyone with an addiction, an I can only imagine an Opioid addiction is even worse than what I am going through.\n\nFinally, Governmental offices are offices of public service.  But somewhere along the line the government became something more akin to parents.  Telling us what we can an cannot do.  This basically reverses the roles and makes us servants or children.  It is taking away our freedoms for some false sense of security.  Decades of literal brainwashing people with complete lies about marijuana has made them so scared of anything not prescribed has made it easy to convince people to give up freedoms in exchange for \"safety\".  This is a thing that our one of our forefathers WARNED US NOT TO DO.\n\nThank you for your time.  I just want to finish by contemplating what a crazy society we live in where alcohol kills 6 people per day but no one even flinches.  Kratom, we don't even know if it's actually the cause of anyone's death yet everyone is so quick to make it illegal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10562","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Peltier","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am fully opposed to the listing of Kratom as a schedule 1 drug.

Following the surgery, I was prescribed Oxycontin for the pain. After I had recovered from the initial trauma of the surgery, I stopped taking the Oxycontin both because it made me too groggy, and because I was concerned about its well known addictive potential. I still had a fair amount of pain, especially around the abdominal scars and I just tried to live with it, but the pain took a toll on my energy levels and appetite. \nI tried medical marijuana for relief, and while it helped with my appetite, it didn't relieve much of the pain, and it left me uncomfortably spaced out.\nA friend happened to have a farm on which he grew a few types of Mitragyna speciosa. He sent me a packet of leaves suggesting it might offer some relief. It was perfect. It gave me energy instead of making me groggy. It soothed the pain and allowed my appetite to return. \nI used it every day for several months, but as I healed, the pain diminished and I stopped using Kratom. The only discomfort I felt upon discontinuation was a deep fatigue that lasted about two days after I stopped, and I never felt an overwhelming need to continue using it.\nSince that time, I have always kept some around. Occasionally the pain flares up (usually when it's cold and damp out) and I use it for a short period of time. I also use it from time to time for long lasting calm energy, on days when I am feeling tired or unambitious. \nIn my roughly 7 years of experience, I have not found its addictive or abuse potential to be any greater than that of coffee or tea, and if anything it should be regulated as a food product approved for human consumption, just like our favorite energizing beverages. \nThank you for taking the time to listen to people who would be adversely affected by Kratom's prohibition.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7648","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter Washburn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n My name is John Henderson. I am a Senior utility operator for the city of Phoenix water department, and I have  been a loyal city servant now for over 21 years. In 2008 I began to develop severe pain in my lower extremities. within a year the pain became so bad that it was almost intolerable. I was diagnosed with \"compartmental nerve compression\" caused by Charcot Marie Tooth disease\". About that time my hips started going bad. I was diagnosed with \"FAI\" in both hips. Basically the cartilage inside both my hips is shredded due to genetic issues. I will need two new hips in the not to distant future.\n  After 7 surgeries, and almost daily physical therapy, I am getting around pretty well, but my daily life is, and will be, spent in physical pain. When I get home from work each day my body is extremely stiff and sore. I liken it to an engine loosing it's oil. For years now I have been taking prescription pain relievers some evenings after work, just to be able perform normal  activities around home. I hate that I have needed to take them, but it's quite often necessary. \n About 2 years ago a friend at work recommended that I give \"Kratom\" a try. I was skeptical because up to that point, nothing worked for my pain and discomfort except for the hard core pain meds. To my surprise, Kratom worked. In fact it has worked so well that I now take very few of the hard core pain meds. A nominal dose of Kratom not only relieves my pain and nerve issues, but it does so without any of the side effects I was getting from taking Vicodin almost every day. And Kratom is natural, not synthetic!\n Kratom has been nothing short of a miracle to me. My nerve issues in my lower legs can be so bad that at times my feet feel as though they are heavy bricks that I drag around with me as I walk. Kratom does an amazing job of relieving, or temporarily eliminating these symptoms. Kratom also controls the severe pain caused by my hip arthritis.\n   Please keep this herb available to the public. Please keep it available for research as I believe it's potential is immense... I am a loyal public servant, Father, brother and friend. I hold an important position with the City of Phoenix Arizona Government. In my 22 years of service I have called into work sick only 5 times... My point is that I am an extremely responsible member of society. I take my health very seriously, and I believe strongly that Kratom should remain available to the public..\n\nThanks so much for your time,\nJohn Henderson","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4509","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-12T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Henderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been using Kratom for the last several years to curb alcohol cravings.

I was put on anti-depressants, and we went through 8-9 specific drugs to find the right one for me. I wasn't seeing any relief, and after some visits with my primary physician I was referred to the pain center in my area. They did MRIs, X-rays, blood work; you name it. \n\nThey couldn't give any reason I was suffering and diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. If you're not familiar with fibromyalgia, it is pain in the nerves and muscles throughout the entire body. It affects your daily life, your mental and emotional state, and your sleep patterns. There were nights I couldn't sleep more than 2 hours because of pain and restless legs. \n\nThe doctor put me on Tramadol, Cymbalta, Lyrica, Pregabalin, Vicodin, Percocet, Diclofenax, Ambien, Cyclobenzaprine, and Celebrex. Not all of those were at the same time, but we had to rotate through quite a bit of them before we found a good balance. After about a year I couldn't afford to continue going to the pain center. My primary physician kept me on the Tramadol, but that was only enough to keep me from lying in the bed in pain all day.  It masked the pain so I could at least get my kids off to school and do a load of laundry.\n\nA friend of mine mentioned this plant called \"kratom\". I thought \"There's no way this is going to work.\" So I bought the cheapest option they had and gave it a shot. It was like night and day. After continual use, about three months in, I was able to get off EVERYTHING and just use the kratom. It helped with my anxiety, depression, AND pain. I was able to do so much more than my normal \"one load of laundry\". I was able to clean my house like I wanted to. I was able to do ALL the laundry. I was able to make meals for my family and spend time at the park with the kids. My kids were so appreciative of my newfound energy and pain relief.\n\nWhen the risk was arising for scheduling the plant I tried to stop taking it to see what kind of effect it would have on my pain and anxiety levels. After three days without taking kratom, my fibromyalgia flared up worse than it has in years. I was stuck in bed with heating pads for my back, ice packs for my costochondritis, and Percocet and Tramadol for the muscle pain and spasms. If this miracle plant is blacklisted, I will have to start at square one again. Kratom has given me so much relief and ability to handle my daily responsibilities as I run my own business, and I'm married with four children under the age of 13. \n\nThis plant has changed my capabilities for the better over the last couple of years and if it is placed as a schedule I, I will have to revert to toxic medications that could eventually destroy my liver, or kidneys. Please keep this plant legal. There are more people out there like me that rely on this amazing plant to function through their lives in their day to day.\n\nThank you for your consideration in this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6316","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aubrey Luther","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern:\nI am a kratom consumer.

Top of the list for my need for kratom was pain relief. I had been prescribed painkillers on and off for a couple years due to a bulging disc, bursitis, and facet arthrosis. They made me ill. I built a tolerance. They minimally masked pain. Kratom has restored my health by relieving my pain and alleviating the depression I sustained from my body not working to my advantage. I do not have to use kratom daily (like my coffee), I do not experience withdrawal symptoms and it has improved my life in so many aspects. I do not believe this herb should be scheduled as it has been used safely for hundreds of years, it has never killed anyone (by itself), and with limited pain relieving resources on the market today, many are not safe for my body as a whole and/or are tightly regulated for abuse and overdose potential.

By the time I got to college, the depression was unbearable and I ultimately went on Paxil.  The  positive effects I had plateaued and it was ineffective after about 3 years on it. I was then moved onto Abilify, Wellbutrin, clonopin and then LExapro finally all in various stages of my life with little effect.  \n\nI am now 41. \nI weened myself off these medications with some horrible side effects.  It was only until I discovered Kratom about 2 years ago that I feel I have successfully reduced my depression and curbed my PTSD.  I am able to vocalize my feelings more and become the person I've wanted to be.   It has helped me overcome my traumas from the past and made me a more productive person. \n\nPlease do not demonize those that need this plant.  \nThank you","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7796","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Terryn Molina, and I believe kratom should remain legal.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18554","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Terryn Molina","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi my name is Dana I'm a mother of 4 and grandmother of 11 I've been diagnosed with arthritis in my lower back .

Kratom is not strongly psychoactive, and primarily used by opiate addicts as a safe alternative to methadone. There are zero recorded incidents of anybody dying due to consumption of Kratom, and methadone overdoses are responsible for around 5000 deaths every year in the United States alone. It would be a transparent act of pure pandering to corporate interests if the DEA decided to schedule one of the safest substances used to combat opiate addictions. It is paramount to the public interest that this substance does not become illegal, as it is very likely that addicts using Kratom to help themselves with withdrawal will turn to more dangerous alternatives, or even go back to using the opiate that they are addicted to. The likely result if this decision was made would be a noticeable increase in the number of opiate related deaths. If the goal of the DEA is to reduce the harm caused by narcotics and addictive drugs, scheduling Kratom is not the way to achieve it.\n\nThank you for your consideration of this issue, I hope that the decision that is best for the public will be made.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3622","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom would be an enormous mistake and detrimental to so many United States citizens.  Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.  If kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars; contributing even more innocent individuals to the overcrowding of American prisons.  Kratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.  Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.  Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.  There are many harmful side effects of many other already legal substances, like alcohol, for instance and yet these remain legal because criminalization is simply impossible to enforce, and we shouldn't try.  I for one would rather see my tax dollars and my countries resources going towards sex trafficking and slave rings as well as ending hate crimes and legalized discrimination such as this insufferable War on Drugs.   In summation, Prohibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.  Based on all of this information, in what ways are you attempting to rationalize that banning kratom would enrich or aid our country as a whole?\n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14244","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katie Cramer","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a severe bladder disease which requires me to use catheters every time I urinate.

A bartender who doesn't drink as ironic as that is. I'm actually, surprisingly, against letting any foreign substance into my body. We know alcohol, tobacco, fatty foods, etc are bad so I stay away from them. I'm one of those \"all natural types\" not a hippy or anything  like that. I just prefer to consume food, supplements, juice, etc in their natural form. I'm also a lover of tea and coffee. I have an impressive variety of tea in my cupboard, call me a collector . Some people have twenty kinds of liquor...I have twenty  kinds of tea. Along with chamomile, ginger, lemon, blueberry and mint I have kratom tea. To me, drinking a cup of kratom tea is very similar to drinking a cup of coffee, so I was baffled when I found out that the DEA was putting their efforts towards banning it. We have a heroine and prescription drug problem like the world has never seen and the DEA, who is supposed to be helping us, is focusing their time and our tax dollars on banning a tea. What is going on and why? \n Being a bartender, I here alot of vented frustration. And there are a few things that come up day after day. The people, and this is an obvious one, do not trust our current government. This should be no surprise to you given the presidential election that just passed. They spew alligations of corruption and of our goverment being unloyal to the people. \n For the longest time I had your back. I thought that the people's best interest was always in mind. But now I wonder, at least when it comes to the kratom dicussion, is that the case? Why is the goverment trying to ban a plant that has helped so many Americans ? Why are they so worried about the supposed handful of deaths that occured at the hands of kratom? It's a painfully small number compaired to prescription drugs, ciggarettes, diabetes,  and for the love of god, alcohol. It is to small to make sence.  Please leave kratom alone and focus your efforts on the real problems. The people have made it clear to you that we do not support you in the banning of kratom and now, as an institution governed by the people, you must listen.

I am a 28 year old male. I live with a chronic illness called hemochromatosis, which is a genetic disorder that causes my body to absorb too much iron. It can cause fatal liver disease, lung disease, and heart disease if left untreated. Even with treatment, however, I still suffer from crippling arthritis and fatigue when my iron gets too high. I take several medications, and I also take about 2 grams of kratom twice daily to help with the pain. Kratom has become an important part of my daily health regimen, which also includes coffee to help wake me up in the morning and combat my fatigue, and eggs, which reduce iron absorption. Like coffee and eggs, kratom has an impact on my overall wellbeing, but I don't treat it like a drug. \n\nI have been taking kratom daily for the past 6 months. In that time, I have not needed to increase my dosage to get the same effect. I have been taking the same dose since day one. I have taken more than 2 grams on two occasions intentionally to try increasing the pain relief, but only found that it made me tired\n\nI have taken prescription opioids before (by prescription), and the effects of kratom are not equivalent to those in my experience. The effects are far milder, there is no sense of euphoria, and the pain relief kratom provides is less (although still stronger than most otc medicines I have tried).\n\nKratom does not treat my condition. It merely provides some pain relief for my arthritis. Without kratom, working would be difficult.\n\nI do not believe kratom is dangerous, and it has not proven to be addictive in my case. I do not \"crave\" kratom. I have never feared having an overdose, nor becoming addicted. My only concern is that tainted kratom may be available on the market, and I make certain to purchase my kratom from reliable sources.\n\nI would like to see sensible regulations that police kratom vendors and weed out unethical and unwanted adulteration of kratom products, similar to what is done with other herbal supplements. If kratom is approved as an herbal supplement then these regulations will be possible. Shady vendors that market kratom as a\"legal high\" feel the need to dope the herb to make it recreational and \"fun\". Kratom, by itself, is not strong enough to produce the high that recreational users seek. By regulating the herb, we can not only ensure that the US supply of kratom is safe for consumption, but we can stop peddlers from trying to sell tainted drugs to addicts and children on the premise that it's safe and natural, when really it's doped with designer drugs.\n\nScheduling kratom is a horrible idea. It is completely unnecessary, and will create the very sort of illegal smuggling market that the DEA intends to fight. This market will not be fueled by drug addicts seeking a fix, but by the chronically ill like myself who have found kratom to be a tremendously beneficial part of their daily health regimen. Banning kratom is a fool's errand. If it were actually dangerous then I could see the point, but why go through the trouble of dealing with all the negative consequences and enforcement costs of policing yet another illegal substance? Is kratom really worth that trouble? The overwhelming majority of citizens believe this ban is a huge waste of time and resources, and I among them.\n\nAlthough I do not use kratom to help with opioid addiction, it is worth noting that this is another principle use of the herb. I have heard many stories of addicts using kratom to fight their addictions, and with frequent success. I don't have personal experience with this, but it is another strong reason why banning kratom would hurt rather than help the DEA's goal of stopping drug abuse. I cannot fathom why the DEA has come to the conclusion, on any reasonable grounds, that this herb should be placed in schedule I.\n\nI disagree with the proposed ban on kratom and I will actively fight to stop it.\n\nSincerely,\nSeth B.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8987","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"seth brunson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Using kratom helped me stop abusing alcohol.

I went to my doctor and asked for medicine for ADHD and I began taking kratom so I would not suffer with the withdrawals. It was literally a miracle and I was able to quit the opiates entirely!

It helps so much without harsh side effects caused by prescription pain medication,  and over the counter drugs such as NSAIDS, and tylenol. It helps so many people though, in so many different ways. It has helped many get off drugs such as heroin, which is a growing, dangerous addiction in our society. It has helped many others with anxiety, depression,  fatigue,  again, without horrible side effects that medication can cause, and prevention of leading to street drug use. This plant does not cause harm. I know the reasoning behind a b a n being \"some people have abused it\", but many have abused cough medicine as well. Are we going to ban Robitussin?

As a chemist, I was wary of any problems that may occur during the use of kratom and it's effects on the body. I dived deep into toxicological reports and user reports on kratom to try to figure out the pros and cons of the plant material. My opinion thus far, even upon reading those reports where kratom toxicity was determined to be the leading cause of a death, is that kratom is fairly safe. The reports I have seen have mitragynine plasma concentrations that would only be achievable from ingesting kilograms of kratom leaf powder, given mitragynine's low bioavailabilty and low concentration in leaf powder. I have seen far more positive reviews, from mood lifting abilities and higher work output, to it's pain killing properties that have given many people a less addictive alternative to dangerous opiod painkillers prescribed in this country. I believe that scheduling kratom would not only be a mistake on the DEA's part, but would end up posing a great threat to public health as they deprive a free people of their choice in a more natural alternative to antinociceptive subatances.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3909","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gabriel Walkup","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Natalie Pickup. I am 24 years old, female, and I am a server at a family owned restraunt in Arvada, Colorado. I know my job does not show it, but I have actually come a long way from where I was  a year go. All my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression. Whether it was passed down to me through my father or I acquired it from years of peer bullying is unknown to me. I have seen many psychiatrists and counselors throughout my young life. I was put on many antidepressants,  all of which had horrible side effects and made me feel like a walking zombie. A couple years ago I decided that since these medications were not helping and the counseling proved uneffective, I was going to self medicate. I bet you can guess what I chose as my poison. Like many, I chose alcohol. It was convenient,  always available,  and even being under 21 at the time I could access it easily. My life spiraled out of control from the moment I picked up the bottle. Long story short, I lost my friends, my job, compromised the relationship between me and my family, I basically lost my young life. Not to mention my health declined   quickly and it showed through my pale and bloated alcoholic skin. \nI tried getting counseling, I tried the medications again, but nothing could keep me and my liquid lover apart. The anxiety and depression always came back and it was unbearable without alcohol. As I was reading an online blog about addicts and anxiety sufferers, I came across the mention of kratom. I read positive things about it and desperate to get relief from the agony of depression and the shame of alcoholism, I decided to give it a try. I do not abuse kratom like I abused alcohol, simply put, I can't. It would be impossible to abuse kratom in the way so many abuse illicit drugs simply for the reason that kratom is not well tolerated in high doses and you often just get a bad case of nausea if you go overboard. If you use it too regularly it has no effect at all which deters users from abusing it as well. Kratom has helped me in so many ways. It has releived my anxiety, helped with my energy levels from anemia caused by my drinking habits, and best of all it saved me from losing my life to alcohol. When I heard the DEA was planning on making it a schedule  1 drug I was stunned. This herb that barely alters one's state of mind is being deemed deadly and toxic yet alcohol and other prescription drugs are allowed to keep working their evil and wrecking the lives of those whose suffering probably is not well understood by the gentleman in his lab coat researching causes of addiction. I have always trusted the DEA and their decisions, but this movement to ban an herb that, by itself,  has shown may times to be quite harmless makes me doubt where the DEA's true interests really lie. With all do respect I do not mean to be accusatory but this ban has me scratching my head wondering what else that has been deemed \" bad \" is really actually quite harmless, and the opposite of that which is legal. Many citizens I speak to feel the same. Thank you for taking the opportunity to read and consider my thoughts on the subject. At least I can say I did my part.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12580","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Natalie Pickup","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've tried kratom in the suggested moderate doses of a teaspoon or so and as far as 'getting high and going wild' that did not happen.

Kratom has been used by millions of people all of the world for hundreds of years without much in the way of body counts or addiction. I think the DEA needs to start leaving plants alone, all plants.

Every 6-12+ months I purchase 1-2 oz of Kratom powder (various strains) online and consume it over the course of a couple weeks. I mix roughly a teaspoon or two of powder with 8-16 ozs of water and drink it. Chosen quantity depends on degree of effect I desire, although even when I have inadvertently taken a more liberal dose (an additional teaspoon or two), the effects have never been significantly impairing and I go about my day. I never felt the need to increase dosage due to tolerance,. I also never had difficulty stopping use beyond mild and brief cravings. I used it recreationally as a \"treat\" and mild relaxant during times I felt high-strung. However, I emphatically never felt dependent or compulsive about use and in fact usually felt satisfied by my use and content to enjoy it in this way. I was first introduced to Kratom circa 2012 by retail coworkers who recommended it recreationally and as a way to take the edge off a stressful day at work while getting a stimulant boost in order to have energy while working. During busy season, virtually all 8 or so sales employees used it throughout the day, often gratefully sharing with each other, and were able to function normally and never had issues with impairment or adverse effects in any way (including detection by customers or management who might have disapproved). To my knowledge, none of these individuals ever developed an addiction to the substance, nor have anyone else to whom I have introduced and with whom I have shared Kratom. A couple of the persons that first shared it with me I knew to illegally use prescription opoids and admitted to previous addiction problems with them; these individuals cited Kratom as an effective method of decreasing opoid dependence and to my knowledge successfully did so. Others did not have histories of substance abuse, and had no observable issues with Kratom,as well. I am addicted to nicotine and often depend on caffeine, but do not use other drugs and very infrequently drink alcohol (4 or less standard drinks per month). However, I have had an alcohol use issues in the past (ranging from mild to severe between 2006 and 2011) and have experimented with several other illegal substances without becoming dependent (none were IV drugs, frequency of use was fewer than 5 instances in my life for any one substance, except for marijuana which I smoked more frequently at times over the years). I never consumed Kratom simultaneously with other substances except occasional alcohol or possibly caffeine. My subjective experience of the effects of Kratom included an expanded sense of contentment, mild stimulation similar to caffeinated drinks (plus some physiological stimulation including: slightly increased perspiration, flushed skin, & sexual arousal). I mostly felt like I was in a relaxed \"groove\" while performing whatever tasks at hand or simply reclining & engaging in passive entertainment. I will also note that I perceived some inhibition of my ability to calculate or engage in complicated planning tasks while under the influence of Kratom (e.g. counting money, balancing a cash register, conversing about everyday logistical concerns over the phone while driving). In my chosen mode of delivery, the strong taste of plant material also discouraged overconsumption (sometimes I lost interest in even finishing the full dose I had prepared). I noted that some individuals who I saw try Kratom experienced nausea & abdominal discomfort that discouraged them f/ using it. I never had these effects, although I did once vomit a large amount of recently ingested mixture (large amounts of water w/ an amount of Kratom on the higher side of what I previously described as my normal intake) after a prolonged (2+ hours), strenuous hike (but was not nauseous & felt fine immediately afterwards). I wanted to describe this experience as accurately as possible to provide context for why it is inconceivable to me that this substance would appropriately belong in a class w/ drugs like heroin and cocaine. It is as benign as caffeine, in my opinion, &probably less problematic than alcohol/marijuana. So, in favor of my own sporadic, occasional enjoyment and empathy for opioid addicts who may find this to be a suitable path toward harm reduction & away f/ addiction. For further credibility re: my judgment, note that I have worked for 4 years in mental health & directly work w/ a lot of people w/ substance use disorders of all shapes & sizes; I am also currently a Master's-level student in the 2nd year of a Clinical Psych program & have interned for a year with a neuropsychologist in a hospital & medical rehab setting. Further and finally, I hope by openly disclosing less-than-perfect aspects of my related background, it conveys the strength of my conviction that Kratom is not inherently harmful and may even be useful as a legal alternative to other opioids.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3229","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To DEA regarding kratom, \nIncluding myself we have 4 family members who enjoy daily intake of kratom.

It is a tool to help people deal with overwhelming pain both physical and emotional when western medicine does not work. Since finding Kratom. I graduated college and enrolled in an M.B.A. program. I have a 4.0 post finding Kratom. I had to drop out before it. I bought a house. I got married to my lovely wife. I have one boy, a three year old who I take great care of and provide everything he needs. My wife is pregnant with our second child. I have a great job that allows me to afford to support children and own a house. All of these things seemed as if they were just a pipe dream before Kratom. Now they are a reality I am afraid to lose. I am sure this website is full of 10,000 plus stories of people who are in less pain, emotional and physical. I am sure there are stories of people who kicked opiates with the help of Kratom. I will not go on and on. One last thing I will mention is please understand the consequences even if the D.E.A.'s intentions are pure. Opiates are either illegal or controlled depending on what form the come in. More and more people are dying of over doses now than ever. It is not from the drugs they are hooked on. It is from Fentanyl laced products. People who are in pain will always find away to reduce it.

I suffer minor aches and pains from osteoarthritis and the effects of getting older. I have been taking NSAIDS daily since 2009, of which known long term effects include kidney, stomach, and heart damage; to address these aches until I tried kratom about a year ago. I found that Kratom tea relieves my pain so that I can be more active and sleep better. In addition, it helps me feel more motivated and in a better mood. I drink it a few times a week after I do yard work or exercise, for example.\nThere is ample experience sharing and information available on the Internet to set proper expectations for benefits and minor adverse effects if too much is consumed by accident. Consequently, I have never experienced a bad effect from it. According to reports, adverse effects are minor and resolve in a few hours. On a positive note, the minor side effects of over consumption serve the purpose of discouraging attempts to abuse it. I feel more confident that I am not damaging my heart and kidneys from using it, than I was when I took ibuprofen. Since I have been drinking kratom tea a few times a week, I have not had any colds or allergy flare-ups either. I see my doctor regularly, and my labs are consistently in the normal ranges.\nI encourage kratom to be studied in regards to its nutritional analysis, as I suspect it to be as beneficial as other green vegetables such as kale or spirulina. In addition to its nutritional benefits, it appears to have minor energizing and pain relieving effects similarly to coffee. A study to investigate its safe use would provide the scientific justification of what tens of thousands of users over hundreds of years already know. \nKratom has the potential to be a great benefit to society. It helps people avoid dangerous prescriptions and expensive doctor visits. This relieves pressure on the health care system and lowers insurance costs for all of us. Please do not take it off the market because of a few unscrupulous marketers and their outrageous claims of a legal high that alarm the authorities and encourage abuse by the ignorant.

I could write down a flood of text explaining what kratom is, citing various articles on the safety of this plant and why the DEA's perception of it is wrong, but if you are in fact someone who has the knowledge and credibility to be reading this letter then I'm sure you are already well aware of the fundamentals of the legal battle for kratom. With that said, I'll jump right into it.\n\nI come from an abusive upbringing, both physically and emotionally. When I was 22 years old, I was prescribed Zoloft, a serotonin reputable inhibitor anti-depressant. It helped the frantic anxiety I've dealt with for the better part of my life but it also completely muted my personality. At age 24, following a botched dental surgery, I found myself on hydrocodone, an opiate painkiller, for more than 3 weeks straight. Hydrocodone was effective at easing my physical pain but not nearly as well as it did my existential, emotional pain. I was young and ignorant. I had no idea that it was of the same drug class as heroin and morphine and I was unaware of it'a addictive risk. \n\nWhen the prescription ran out, I wasn't ready to let it go, to go back to that familiar hurt and depression... So I kept running and sought out more hydrocodone illegally on the streets. I was an opiate addict before I even knew it. I've never really been much of a drinker. I didn't partake in the typical recreational substances like cannabis. I never had a prior problem with a substance for there to be any kind of red flag or to even know what a substance problem looked like. That destructive habit went on for over a year, as it slowly evolved into me buying whatever opiate pain pills I could find. At it's climax I was buying heroin when I couldn't find pills. Using heroin intranasally allowed me to rationalize my use because, \"hey, you know? It could be worse. I could be shooting up.\"\n\nA friend of a friend, a few years younger than I was at the time, overdosed on heroin and died alone in his bathtub. That's what it took for me to quit opiates. I stopped cold turkey and managed to make it 4 months before I slipped up an drew nearly relapsed. I didn't want to go back to that life but the Post Acute Withdrawal symptoms made life so seemingly impossible to live. I couldn't function, I was lethargic, unmotivated and incapable of experiencing any shred of joy. Desperate for a solution, I searched online for an alternative or anything that could assist me in feeling ok. That's when I found kratom. \n\nThe interesting thing about kratom is that I could tell that it was in a sense quieting my screaming opioid receptors, but in a way that didn't feel like an opiate. I felt like I could rebuild my life and recover all that I've lost in such a short time. Not only did Kratom allow me to not crave opiates but it made tapering down and quitting Zoloft significantly easier than it would have been without it. \n\nI've been taking kratom more or less daily for nearly 5 years now. I haven't had a single relapse and I have never been able to hold a job for as long as I have while using kratom. I feel healthier. Kratom is rich in anti-oxidants but what is incredible isn't that I've only gotten sick once in the entire period of taking it. On average, I've taken 5 grams of powder in capsules, 3 times a day for about 5 years. Last year, I had an EKG, blood work and a liver enzyme test, all which came back with results showing that I'm perfectly healthy. No abnormalities and above average results.\n\nAs with most substances, there is going to be an adjustment period when you cease to use after prolonged periods of time. Yes, daily kratom use does come with the risk of mild physical dependence if you don't rotate strains and take breaks at least once a month, but it is on par with the physical withdrawal of caffeine and sugar, things widely accessible, things we give our kids. I don't believe that that alone justifies banning it and putting it in the same classification as heroin and MDMA. \n\nI believe regulation would be fine. I'm not opposed to quality control, regulation or any type of research that would minimize risk and empower the consumer to know exactly what they are getting. But please... please don't make it a felony. Please dont make it next to impossible to obtain. \n\nI thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20427","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Marah","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My wife ingests Kratom once a day, and sometimes twice a day, for pain management and it works as well as or better than any prescription medication she's used.

I have worked for companies that focus on developing the Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for pharmaceutical companies that develop schedule II drugs and have a deep understanding of risk management issues when dealing with scheduled substances.\n\nRelating to kratom and Mitragyna speciosa, I have personally researched this plant and have used it myself. It is abundantly clear that kratom alone is exponentially safer than any prescription or illicit opiate that currently exists. Although the active ingredient is considered an agonist at the opioid receptors, the intrinsic activity at the mu receptor that causes respiratory depression is rarely, if ever, strong enough to cause respiratory failure (even with the strongest extracts available). There seems to be a ceiling in which kratom's opioid agonist activity peaks. Even when combined with other CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines, it is very rare for users to overdose on Kratom. To new users, it is more likely that the user will become nauseated or vomit when they take too much kratom. It is close to impossible for users to consume enough kratom to cause any significant life-threatening risk. \n\nI do believe the agonist activity at the opioid receptors (like any opioid agonist) has the potential to cause physical dependence, but it is also clear from years and thousands of anecdotal reporting that the withdrawal from kratom is mild compared to pharmaceutical opioids currently on the market. Kratom also has a very short half-life (as a plant), and thus the withdrawal is also known to be of a much shorter duration. It is also clear that kratom has provided many heroin or pharmaceutical opioid addicts a much safer and \"organic\" alternative and that it has undoubtedly saved many lives. Kratom dosing as a powder, which is the form most users take, also allows dependent users an easier way to taper off the herb.\n\nAs with all drugs that go through FDA scrutiny, the gold standard is \"risk vs benefit.\" The benefit of kratom clearly outweighs the risk when you review the scientific literature and when you speak with thousands of users who find kratom a much appealing alternative than prescription medications to treat all sorts of medical ailments from pain to insomnia to depression.\n\nFinally, if kratom does become a scheduled drug, the unintended consequences is what I am most worried about. If the argument is that kratom is addictive and that many people are addicted to this plant, then scheduling kratom as a schedule 1 illegal drug will force addicts to turn to heroin, much like how many prescription opioid addicts turned to heroin when their supply of pain pills were cut off in the past decade. No one can argue that heroin is the gold standard opiate that is the leading cause of opiate overdoses. If Kratom is banned, it is a guarantee that there will be another spike and increase in heroin overdoses/deaths as former opioid users who have turned to kratom are now forced to go back to heroin.\n\nI implore the DEA to review all the evidence and think about the consequences of banning kratom. Kratom has not only helped addicts detox off harder opioids as well as provided hardcore addicts who are not ready to stop using a safer alternative, it has also provided medically ill patients a natural alternative to more dangerous prescription medications. Scheduling Kratom would prevent further research on this plant for future medical uses for diseases that we currently are not treating effectively with modern medicine.\n\nI strongly believe Kratom should remain legal and that this is one plant that needs to be carefully researched and looked at for all the benefits it possesses. While all things can be exploited and used irresponsibly, kratom is one plant that should not be lumped into the same category as illicit drugs, if not only for the fact that thousands of kratom users will turn to heroin, but that this plant has dozens of known benefits in the medical literature with the benefits clearly outweighing the dangers.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAce S.

I was prescribed lots of pain medication that made me feel miserable but the pain was so intense I had to take it. Many years later I started suffering from pain from my sciatica nerve it was crippling me and I would end up in the hospital almost every month because the pain was too much to manage. I decided to search for natural healthy alternatives to help with the pain and I came across Kratom after doing a lot of research I decided to purchase the tea called Kratom. It helps so much that I didn't need to take any of my depression medication, and anxiety medication, mood stabilizer medication, sleeping medication, and pain medication. Obviously I'm not perfect and I still suffer from anxiety on a daily basis but it help reduce a lot of my anxiety. \n\n-I have nerve pain, anxiety, depression, carpal tunnel, PTSD and weight issues. I was taking a total of 14 prescription pills a day to \"manage\" these symptoms that left me feeling like a zombie. I actually felt worse taking the perception medication. I have been taking kratom to manage my pain, anxiety, depression, energy levels for 3 years. \n\n-I'm a wife to a United States Airman, we have one daughter.

I'm a HVAC technician in Des Moines, IA. My job requires me to lift heavy things, climb ladders, be constantly on the move. There are times where my body is very sore from working long hours and doing extensive manual labor. I have used Kratom to combat with pain from my job. I don't use it everyday, I'd say more like every other month. Kratom allowed me to relieve pain with zero side effects. I just felt normal with no pain. When I heard there was a potential that you may put kratom on the schedule one list without getting any feed back from the FDA I was deeply disturbed. I think the DEA should have extensive knowledge of the pros and cons of this plants before making any rash decisions. There has been a ton of anecdotal evidence that this plant helps in many ways. Examples of the anecdotal evidence is pain relief that's not addictive. Helps people get off of addictive opiates. Helps beat their addiction to alcohol. I have heard of soldiers that have fought hard for this country using Kratom to battle ptsd and physical pain from war. Kratom should be scientifically studied to either concur with the anecdotal evidence or disprove it. It would be highly irresponsible to ban a plant we know nothing about. We don't even know the ld50 of Kratom. Lets not make the mistake again of banning a plant we know nothing about.

I HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD AND PLAYING HARD FOR A LONG TIME. PAIN WAS NO STRANGER FROM YEARS OF BACK BREAKING LABOR. I FIND IT SAD THAT ONCE AGAIN THE PEOPLE OF A FREE NATION HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT TO CONSUME A STINKING PLANT. A PLANT MAN. THAT ASIDE, MY STORY STARTED JULY 10TH 2012. I WAS IN A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION WHILE RIDING MY MOTORCYCLE. LADY RAN A STOP SIGN AT AROUND 30 AND I WAS DOING FORTY. WHEN SHE PULLED OUT AND TURNED INTO ME. HONESTLY, I SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE. THE ACCIDENT LEFT ME WITH PART OF MY LEFT KNEE MISSING, MY HEAD SPLIT TWICE IN THE SAME SPOT, FORMING AND X ON MY FOREHEAD. MY RIGHT LEG BEING CRUSHED AND VERY NEARLY RIPPED COMPLETELY OFF, A FEW INCHES ABOVE MY ANKLE. IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE I WENT FROM NEEDING TO TAKE HEAVY DOSES OF VERY STRONG PAINKILLERS, TO THE LOW END OF THE TOTEM POLE. THEN RIGHT BACK AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS, TO BEING ON THE ONE THING I NEVER WANTED TO BE ON. METHADONE. I DIDN'T EVEN TAKE TYLENOL BEFORE THIS UNLESS IT WAS A BAD DAY. SO I SPENT TWO YEARS ON THAT STUFF. I HATED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. THE OUT LOOK WAS BLEAK FOR ME, OR PEOPLE IN THIS POSITION. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WILL NEVER FIND A WAY TO BE RID OF IT. I WONT EVEN START ON THE SIDE EFFECTS WHEN YOU TRY OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO STOP TAKING CRAP LIKE METHADONE. SIMPLY PUT, ITS A NIGHTMARE. THEN, A FEW MONTHS AGO A FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT KRATOM. I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST. AS I WOULD HOPE THAT ANY REASONABLE PERSON SHOULD BE. BUT, AFTER THE FIRST DOSE, THE PAIN FROM THE DT'S WENT AWAY.  THEN THE PAIN IN MY BODY. WHICH WAS ALL OVER BY THE WAY. MY DOCTOR, MY WIFE(WHO IS AN M.A.), AND I. HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT THE TRANSFORMATION. I NO LONGER TAKE THESE HEAVY DOSES OF REAL DRUGS. THE EXTRA ENERGY THAT I GET HAS GOT ME BACK UNDER THE WEIGHTS AGAIN, AND THE PAIN RELIEF IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE PILLS. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THERE ARE NO WITHDRAWALS IF I STOP TAKING IT. NO ADDICTION. I NEVER FEEL THE NEED TO TAKE IT UNLESS I NEED IT. BECAUSE NOW I ONLY NEED IT FOR PAIN PERIODICALLY.  NO CRAZY HIGHS FROM IT EITHER. IT JUST WORKS ON PAIN. SO I JUST DONT SEE WHY THE DEA, OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER, IS SO CONCERNED ABOUT A SUPPLEMENT. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE EVERY TIME PEOPLE FIND A NATURAL WAY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO GET IN THE WAY. THEN BITCH WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT KILLING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS FOR STUPID DRUGS. ALL TAKING IT OFF THE MARKET WILL DO IS HURT PEOPLES BUSINESS AND PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED AN OVER THE COUNTER REMEDY. ITS TIME FOR THE PEOPLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. ITS NOT A DOCTORS FAULT IF YOU OVER TAKE YOUR MEDS. JUST LIKE ITS NOT MY FAULT IF SOME MORON EATS A LEAF TILL HE PUKES.  YOU GUYS WANTED AN ANSWER FOR THE OPIOID ADDICTION PROBLEM RIGHT??? WELL, HERE IT IS. KRATOM. MAKING IT FOR BIG PHARM ONLY, OR KEEPING IT OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO NEED THIS TO FIX THEIR LIFE. WILL ONLY HURT THE PEOPLE. THE FACT THAT I EVEN HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ANYONE, IS PLAIN OLE STUPID.

I got on suboxone but it gave me withdrawels that were worse than heroin. I discovered kratom and took it every day to get me through withdraws. It 100% worked and gave me relief without impairing me like methadone and suboxone does. Kratom made me functional enough to hold a job and save my money. It improved my relationships with other people. I have been on kratom for two years and I have never relapsed. I don't even feel the need to take kratom every day. If I feel like I am close to relapsing, I simply take a low dose of kratom and it curbs my opiate cravings. Kratom has also saved me a lot of money. I take 3-5 grams every 24-36 hours. I will take a higher dose if I am trying to forget about  really strong opiate cravings or feel depressed. I will also use higher doses for physical ailments or if I am sick and can't afford to take off work. After 2 years of almost daily use I am healthier than I have ever been because I am off drugs and alcohol. I have never experienced and negative side effects from daily kratom use. Below, I will list the positive and negative effects of this plant. I will also discuss potential kratom withdraw symptoms. \n\nPositive Effects: \n-Elevated mood/motivation\n-Relief from opiate withdraw symptoms\n-An enjoyable, but not impairing, mild buzz \n-Attentiveness\n-Pain relief\n-Constipation relief (because of the fiber)\n-Stress relief\n-Sociability\n-Makes me work harder at my job\n-Faster reflexes\n\nNegative Effects: (but only due to an overdose; which has been a single dose that is 12+ grams)\n-Dizziness\n-Shaky hands\n-Nausea\n-Blurred vision\n(all negative effects subside in 3 or less hours and then I am back to normal)\n\nWithdraw symptoms (due to kratom use)\nIf you are still in the process of abstaining from opiates, you can experience various withdraw symptoms for about 6 weeks. (This is from my personal experience)\nIf you are taking kratom during this time, it is very possible to confuse your prolonged continuous opiate withdraws symptoms with kratom withdraws. \n\nHowever, If you take kratom every day for a year or more and never take an opiate to set you back, then it is possible that you will experience kratom withdraws if you suddenly stop taking it. Long prolonged kratom use can cause certain withdraw symptoms. \nKratom withdraw symptoms are no where near as bad as opiate withdraws and really only last 72 hours at the most. But these symptoms can be easily dismissed and ignored, unlike opiate withdraws. I have never considered doing crime to get money for kratom. I have never felt a kratom \"craving\" except for times I needed it to deal with opiate cravings. I have never made myself go broke to buy kratom. The withdraws simply are not bad enough. Yes, kratom withdraws are uncomfortable, but they don't make you completely unable to go to work or school or function. \n\nKratom Withdraw symptoms:\n-Runny nose\n-Loose stool\n-Increased body temperature\n-Sweating\n-Restless legs (occasionally)","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11324","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jake Miller","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started taking Kratom eight months ago and everything in my life has changed.

It is ruining our marriage and our relationship. He yells constantly at his son. I hope and pray to God this substance is banned and I am all for it's placement on schedule I. Heroin addicts do not need substances which mimic their addiction. Shame on the people trying to protect this life draining product. It's a destroyer not an aid.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5310","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please research the subject of the benefits of Kratom before you even consider banning it as illegal!  From what I have heard, it is of great benefit because it is not addictive, does not put people in the kind of altered state that would make them a danger in any way, such as driving, and it has already been a huge help to people who would otherwise have to continue with addictive and otherwise damaging prescription drugs.  I myself take an antidepressant, which no longer helps me much but it has created such an addiction in my body that if I skip even two days my emotional state is drastically affected and I cannot function normally.   I want to try Kratom with the advice of a doctor to see if this might be the best way to get off the drugs which I have taken since 2001.\n\nPlease be very careful about banning a substance without being absolutely sure it is damaging to people.

Sufferers of Substance Use Disorder are imprisoned for non-violent offenses and a substantial portion of the 15 million American adults suffering from clinical depression can expect regular recurrences, shortened lifespans, and a decreased quality of life.\n\nI am a 27 year old marketing professional and software developer living with depression, a few anxiety disorders, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Before the onset of these illnesses I was on track to have my doctorate in Computer Science from a fairly prestigious university in my early 20s, having begun college in my mid-teens. These illnesses have robbed me of the energy, confidence, and concentration that I once had, sometimes sapping my motivation to such a degree as to prevent me from reaching for a glass of water that is right in front of me. In fact, the stress related to my trauma is so bad that I sometimes have psychogenic seizures in response to certain stress-related triggers. Simply put, these conditions are devastating. \n\nAfter years of therapy and having tried numerous psychiatric medications, I was ready to give up on the idea that things would ever get better. None of the currently available medications even touch my symptoms. Fortunately, a friend introduced me to the dietary supplement kratom and convinced me to give it a try. The difference was like night and day. When I take kratom, I experience as vastly improved sense of health and well-being. Kratom is an amazing tool for combating feelings of low motivation and for promoting an overall sense of calm. I don't take it as a substitute for medical treatment, but rather use it in conjunction with diet, exercise, and other factors that benefit sufferers of mental illness. It is comparable to other dietary supplements such as St. John's Wort or Valerian Root, while being unique and irreplaceable. \n\nHaving taken kratom regularly for 8 years now, I can attest to its effectiveness in improving my quality of life. Since starting kratom, I've gone back to school and am now working toward two Master's degrees, I've also held an amazing full-time job for the past six years. Being able to function again at a high capacity when I was otherwise unable to find relief is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nKratom is an herb in the coffee family that has been used safely for hundreds of years in its native Southeast Asia. Although there are a small number of deaths in recent history in which kratom was consumed by the victim, it would be unfair to attribute these to kratom. In all but one case these deaths can be attributed to the presence of other substances that were also ingested. In no case has kratom ever been shown to be the cause of death, or even a contributor. If someone had coffee earlier in the day and died of a heroin overdose later, you wouldn't blame the coffee. So why blame kratom when someone dies after having consumed several illegal substances alongside it? \n\nNot only does this make no sense, but banning kratom will turn its 3 to 5 million consumers into felons. America already has the world's highest prison population, with a substantial percentage being non-violent drug offenders. People like me, who are simply trying to cope with devastating health issues, will find ourselves with two options: continue taking kratom anyway and potentially share a cell with a rapist if we are caught, or go back to suffering from a disability that is otherwise unmanageable. \n\nLike most responsible kratom users, I am definitely in favor of regulations that would prevent adulterated products from being sold to consumers. Similarly, I can see the validity of arguments in favor of keeping kratom out of the hands of minors and ensuring responsible advertising. However, it is vital that kratom remains easily accessible to those in need. Scheduling kratom, much like scheduling coffee, would place needless restrictions on an important tool, making it inaccessible to a large number of people.\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly urge the DEA to avoid making kratom a controlled substance.

I am also an advocate for the missing (primarialy children) as well as a retired Private Investigator for the State of Missouri. I am a responsible adult who was diagnosed in 2003 with Fibromyalgia, with chronic Migraine (15+ migraines per month) in 2007, with Chronic Pancreatitis in 2010 and more recently, with Multiple Sclerosis. I've lived with a great amount of pain on a daily basis over these past 19 years; pain which could not be eased because I also have a sensitivity to any type of over the counter or prescription pain medications, even aspirin. My system treats them like toxins, rendering them useless and more often than not, causes me to have to be admitted to the hospital in serious condition. In addition to all of this, I am extremely sensitive to artificial additives and chemicals. The end result is a migraine so severe that it also lands me in the hospital. So I just lived each day with the pain and did not realized how much pain I was actually in until I learned about Kratom and about half of it disappeared and with absolutely no negative side effects! That in itself should speak volumes as to the purity of this plant. Kratom simply makes me feel better enough, allows me to move around enough to take up the reins of my life again, to give my husband his wife back, my children their mother, my grandchildren their grandmother and my friends their friend. I am also now able to resume advocating for missing children. Am I addicted? No, not at all. I only utilize Kratom on days when the pain is over a certain level. Do I experience withdrawal symptoms? No, because I am not addicted. Am I impaired in any way? I am a person who will not drive if I have had a single alcoholic drink andyet  I have no hesitation at all in getting behind the wheel after drinking Kratom tea. There is no impairment. Period. \n\nIn reference to Docket No DEA-442W, which would ban Kratom. In my humble opinion, this is a huge mistake! If Kratom were deemed illegal the results would be catastophic.  If this ban were to happen, not only would my family lose their loved one and friend again to an endless life filled with severe pain and loss of mobility, but the same would happen to hundreds of thousands of families. In addition to this, the already epidemic level of opoid use would drastically increase nationwide because Kratom does help just as many folks recover from substance abuse. Personally, if Kratom were banned only for a pharmaceutical company to study it later in order to market a medication containing it, that process would likely involve adding synthetic materials to it which would likely deem it useless for myself and many others like myself who are so sensitive to additives? Why ban a naturally ocurring plant? I would greatly appreciate it if you would please take into consideration my plea along with the thousands of others who have taken the time to sign and comment here.

I have had chronic back pain for over 12 years and anxiety and depression most of my life.  I have been on many prescribed medications for all three problems.  And yes I've had success from some medicines.  But all have come with severe side effects.  So I started looking for safer natural alternatives.  In 2014 I came a cross a magazine article about Kratom.  I began to reserch it to see if it might be an herbal supplement that might help with my back pain.  After 6 months of reading about this herbal supplement I decided to order some.  After it arrived I waited till I had a day off before trying it.  After about 30 minutes of my first time taking Kratom I noticed my pain had disappeared and I felt my mood had lifted.  I began to feel normal and wanted to interact with people again.  I was petrified of being with anyone, even my family for fear of having a panic attack.  \n   So since the summer of 2014 I have been taking Kratom to help with my chronic pain and depression and anxiety.  It has been a blessing to me to have a natural alternative that works.  I do still have to take medications for my mental problems that are prescribed by my psychiatrist.  But I don't have to take strong pain medications anymore.  I know that if I need the stronger medication in case of an injury or illness that I will be able to use a lot less of it and not be afraid of becoming dependent on it.\n   I pray you will make the correct decision and not make Kratom a scheduled drug.  I am not against it being regulated.  But Kratom should remain a natural alternative.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8648","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Malee Holt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To the DEA,  I  was diagnosed with Lyme Disease a year ago.

This comment is being written to address the proposed ban on mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. I am quite nervous about speaking directly to a government agency as I have never attempted such a thing before, but I felt it necessary to voice my opinion on the matter. I discovered kratom online as a result of a lengthy search for natural and safe plant based substances that could effectively ease my often times severe anxiety and panic disorder. This took place a little over 2 years ago and I can say with complete confidence that I succeeded, and found something that insistently but gently lifted me out of a seemingly infinite pit of despair. During the short but significant time that I have used this wonderful herb, I have seen a flowering community emerge! A community full of extremely kind and friendly individuals who have found what some would deem miraculous relief from a multitude of different ailments. The free market surrounding kratom has resulted in widespread access and a growing number of people recovering from these ailments and thus reclaiming their lives and thriving! As a matter of fact, I have had the privilege of witnessing this firsthand with multiple people and on more than one occasion! To list one example, my girlfriend, who suffers with frequent pain brought on by endometriosis, experienced profound relief after consuming kratom. This is not to say she was not apprehensive, but upon hearing testimonials from other women in a similar position, she agreed. Kratom has become a godsend for countless people and should absolutely under no circumstances, be prohibited! The ramifications of such an action could prove to be quite tragic as many hardworking and law-abiding Americans could be plunged back into misery. I wanted to keep this brief so I think on that note, I will conclude. I offer my deepest thanks to any and all who read this and I greatly appreciate the devotion of your time!

The majority of my adult life I have suffered from anxiety, and in seeking treatment I have found that traditional medicines actually make the majority of my problems worse.  I  have been prescribed benzodiazepines in the past, the result's were not desirable and my actions while on these drugs only made my anxiety worse. I turned to self medication with alcohol which only works short term but causes more long term issues. The self medication turned into addiction. \n\nMy fiance gave me the ultimatum to cease drinking or she would leave. After researching alternative medications for anxiety and a couple relapses I discovered Kratom.  I have not had any desire to drink since beginning Kratom. My fiance has made comments on how I am much more pleasant to be around now as well. My relationships with my children and family have become so much better as well. \n\nI don't have any first hand experience with negative side effects of use, and I feel I am benefitting significantly from having this in my life. Banning this I feel would be counterproductive to the current fight on dangerous drugs and those wishing to quit.

My insurance fell through and I was unable to get my medications. The withdrawals from my medication was a nightmare. A good friend told me about Kratom and I tried it. It helped with all my withdrawals and all my medical problems as well. It helps me with my depression, anxiety, shakes, scoliosis pain, and it helps me sleep. Kratom has helped me get my life back. But most importantly my kids have a mom who can dedicate her time to helping them with their autism and homeschooling. I have not noticed any side effects and no withdrawals from kratom.

I work in a retail shop that currently sells this product and has for a long time now. I have watched kratom dramatically change lives of many from all walks of life. This includes mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, school teachers, public officials, and so on. To hear these peoples stories and the reason they have turned to kratom breaks my heart for this product to be removed from the market. Even if it has to be prescribed in this country,  I honestly would much rather see that than for it to be banned all together.r. I did try this product to see what affects it would have on my own body and I honestly dont see the harm in it at all. I have a bad disc in my back and refuse to take pain medication myself for the side effects of these medicines render my ability to be a functioning person in society. I am all about natural remedies to relieve pain if needed. Kratom is a product i personally would turn to if i honestly needed it. I did not find this product to be addictive in any kind of way. I am am a strong minded person that deals with pain everyday and am surrounded by this product as well on a daily basis and still dont find the need to take it on a regular basis. But i too understand why some people need this product daily. I know myself in the future as i get older my disc in my back is going to give me more trouble and i hope this product is around in the future for when i cant stand the pain anymore and need some relief. I have heard the peoples voices and sincerely feel for each and everyones circumstances. The beauty of this product is they can go out of their house and fuction as normal people in society without pain and teach our children, and  run our offices such as police stations and court houses. Be mothers and fathers to our future adults that are to form and shape this country, and make them productive citizens as well. The range of people that I talk to that use this product blew my mind when I began to ask their stories and  retain feed back so i would have a valuable outlook on what some may call a product that is harmful to our loved ones. I have had people literally cry and tell me that the products that are legal for pain prescribed by our doctors, doesn't even begin to touch the pain that they endure everyday. What angers me most about the potential of the ban is to know that all of these upstanding people are going to have to go back to other alternatives from our pharmaceutical companies and become addicted to a substance that renders their abilities to drive vehicles, take care of our children, and simply just to function with a clear mind. I understand the d.e.a does their best to regulate harmful chemicals that clearly effect the body, mind, and soul of our fellow human beings. But kratom come on guys this is not a harmful substance. I am completely dissapointed that this even has potential to be a schedule 1 narcotic. Its ludicrous that it can't even be prescribed to individuals. But their is no ban on substances that are sold to people daily from pharmacy counters all over this country daily that really do turn peoples lives upside down. I have seen these very products ruin peoples lives and tear families apart. Yet kratom I haven't seen do this at all. Thing I have seen it do is turn peoples lives around for the better and improve their quality of life. So with this said please don't take this product away and make people turn to prescribed narcotics that actually are harmful to their quality of life. I hope the right decision is made for all of these individuals that are going to suffer in the long run if kratom is banned. At least control it through our pharmacies if anything and make this an option for people whom want relief from pain but dont want the side effects from pain pills that are prescribed. Lets fight the real issues at hand from the substances that have taken a hold of our loved ones and continue to fight the war on real drugs not kratom. I hope this may have shed some light from an outsider looking in to this so called harmful product. I stress again please let it be prescribed before you just take it away all together. Think about these individuals in the long run that have jobs, kids, and families to take care of. They are not causing anyone any harm nor themselves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4380","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brittany anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My mother has taken Kratom for years, not even as a relief or anxiety aide, but as a simple substitute for coffee to start her day.

I suffer from cronic myofascial pain, neuropathy and connective tissue damage since the year 2000 due to a mva. I am 55 years old, have a full time job since for well over 35 years and am a law abiding citizen. After the MVA in 2000 I have been to countless physical therapies at local hospitals and independently run locations - it did not take the pain away but did help with range of motion. In 2008 I had surgery and a titanium plate installed at C4/C5 to help with the cronic pain and numbing in my left arm and hand- which it did not. Have been receiving Trigger point injections to my neck, upper back and shoulders on a regular basis since. I have taken different types opiates and have suffered the side effects. I came upon Kratom in September of 2016 and have to say \"I have suffered zero side effects\". I feel \"normal\" and am able to focus and not feel tired all of the time. I actually have energy and have not felt this way in years. Kind of like a new lease on life with a clear head. It would be a great dis-service to many to ban Kratom. From what I understand, Kratom has been used for thousands of years. Why all the attention after all of these years? It seems like a money making opportunity for the DEA and related organizations/pharmecutical companies. If that is the case, I kindly ask that, that notion be put aside and instead look at all of the different types of benefits it has for many different diseases. Do your homework like I did. If Kratom is used as directed - there are no health risks or endangering anyones life. We deserve to be comfortable in our own bodies without side effects and the huge price tag. Please leave Kratom distribution just the way it is.

I am 33 years old. I am a US Army Veteran. I have worked in the Middle East several years as both an Armed Forces Service Member and a DOD Civilian as well. I have currently worked for my local city government for the last 7 years. I am also a business owner and combined a combined 100 hour work week. I do not use drugs. I do not drink alcohol. I am a Conservative Republican. My general morals and family values may be much more strict when compared to others. I believe in hard work, respect and drive. I love my country and I love my fellow Americans. I will do anything to protect our citizens and do what it takes to keep them safe.  \n\nThat being said, I am writing this letter, standing on behalf of my fellow Americans and a large group of disabled veterans. This plant, Kratom, should NOT be banned or medically or federally regulated beyond FDA food standards. This plant has given me and my family quality of life we have never had before. It is a simple herbal tea leaf. I use to take up to 25 pills a day for nerve and back pain from injuries aquired while serving my country. I do not like taking prescription pain killers and drugs as they make me feel like I am \"on drugs.\" They make me feel dirty and totally disgusted with myself. They make me feel \"dopey.\" I now only use kratom powder and extracts and that is all I need. I have never felt better and do not feel sick and more importantly, I do not feel impaired, intoxicated or sedated. When I say \"sedated\" speaking in regards to narcotics I am referencing to being intoxicated and non functional. When people say \"sedated\" in regards to kratom, they mean \"more sleepy\" vs more \"energetic\", just like Green Tea vs Camomile Tea for promoting sleep, please do not forget that. \n\nI have personally seen first hand the good it can do as I work with many disabled veterans groups who now have used this bulk herbs for up to 5 years helping veterans with disability issues, drug and alcohol use. I personally have very good friends who are licensed botanist and chemist who have also assured me that the alkaloids are in fact very safe and they are not the same alkaloids as many dangerous drugs that kratom may be compared too. This plant cannot kill you. It does not cause respiratory depression like opiates. We ALL know this at this point. I trust kratom so much that I would feel safe giving it to any one of my family members including my mid-age children. \n\nI have also come to realize that Pfiver is already working on patented products using kratom alkaloids. Many of us group veterans are wondering what our government agencies are going to do to represent us and block us from these type of special interest groups? DEA, FDA, this first line of defense starts with you. We have vowed to give our lives for you, so please remember that when making your decisions regarding trying to ban something that is giving us life after suffering. Please do not let this fall to profit corporations like everything else has. We pray your hearts are in the right place. \n\nI am a red blooded American. I would not do anything to put harm any of our nations citizens in harms way. I would die to keep them safe. There is an extreme drug use problem as well as health care problems in America. People needs help. I know this product saves lives and have seen it work for drug and alcohol addiction. It is a cheap product and can be bought by the lbs for around $20 and even cheaper if the market is not afraid to expand. It leaves people in a clear and conscious state. It heals. Its an herbal miracle. Even in extract form, I know it is not dangerous. The most negative effect it can have is make you nauseous, which is what I get after only eating a general multi vitamin. I dont feel it is as addiction as some have said. I have so much experience with this plant. I have taken it for many years now. if I stop, it is no more then restlessness when trying to sleep. I feel much worse after not drinking coffee and caffeine since I am a heavy coffee drinker\n\nThis is a simple non toxic plant from the earth, our earth, please don't try to keep this one from us. To ban or even let pharmaceutical companies control this product would be extremely dangerous to your fellow citizens. It would push good standing citizens back into drug and alcohol use and citizens who use it for medical purposes would be back at square one.  Yes, thats right, people will be in pain, suffering and even dying, at your hands. That is how serious this is. Please consider what you are doing.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21997","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"william fish","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket No. DEA-442W \nKratom should not be scheduled period,as a schedule one or otherwise.

I fear if it is scheduled it will only compound the allready wide spread opiate epidemic. Not because kratom is addictive itself, but because there are so many in pain everyday supplementing with kratom but still need pain relief on a daily basis.

I have many ambitions, one of which is to continue my career, gain my very own Bar number, and  practice law as a prosecutor. I would not be anywhere close to where I am today without Kratom. Like many fresh-faced college kids at 19, I use to wait tables, this is where I got introduced to Oxycodone. Buying a few of them only once a month turned into spending all of my money, time, and energy into making sure I had enough to get me through the day, better yet even get out of bed. I ignored my responsibilities, failed classes, couldn't pay bills, went from a very extroverted fun-loving person into spending my nights alone and depressed. It got so bad I could barely get out of bed and wouldn't shower for weeks at a time. I can recall 2 times where I probably shouldn't have woken up the next day. Luckily I have a very caring family who encouraged me to get help. I tried many times to stop on my own and even went to the doctors who gave me medications that supposedly would \"ease the WD.\" Finally went into detox for 5 days becaause that was the Cheapest way considering my insurance wouldn't cover out or inpatient. That helped me get the through the worst parts, and this was 6 months ago. I thought I would be good to go, but No the last 6 months I have been clean but experience the most severe anxiety, restlessness, and Would get conctant goose bumps all day. My friend told me about Kratom (she studies Naturopathy) and Kratom is the only thing that eases these minor but lasting WD symptoms. I have always had anxiety which is why I liked the pills initially. Because of Kratom I have stayed clean, successful,have my life together and love life again. Kratom is so natural I don't feel any sort of high At all, I take a very minimal amount and I just have less anxiety and can focus on doing well in life. I know many people have gotten clean for this same exact reason so I really hope that this stays legal. I know many people would feel forced to old ways without it.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2270","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sarah Larkin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please research this and give people a chance to choose for themselves.

In my opinion, it's pretty obvious that Kratom is a threat to Big Pharma's bottom line and they are putting pressure on the DEA to schedule it so they can continue to profit off of the proliferation of prescription pain medication. I have found through research, and my own personal experience that Kratom offers a natural solution to pain management. Kratom helps people, including my wife, to free themselves from prescription pain medication and all the terrible side effects associated with them, including addiction.\n\nMy wife, Summer, has struggled with neck and back pain for nearly 10 years and had been told by multiple doctors to \"get used to it\" b/c she would probably be on pain medication for the rest of her life.  She tried nearly everything she could think of as an alternative to taking pain medication but to no avail; that is, until she found Kratom.  She started using Kratom about 6 months ago after hearing about it from a good friend of ours, Sarah, who had recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  Sarah explained how Kratom had been a Godsend and that she was able to quit using her pain medication within days of using Kratom.  Summer was thrilled to hear this and tried it for herself a few days later. She too was able to stop using her pain medication within days of starting Kratom.  Summer and I were thrilled that she had finally found an answer to her prayers.\n\nI don't believe the DEA should be able to make a decision like this when there is so much evidence to support the benefits of Kratom.  Kratom is a natural botanical that can be used as a viable alternative to prescription pain medication, the same prescription pain medications that are the source of so many deaths and addiction across our country. To blindly throw Kratom into the pool of schedule 1 narcotics would be irresponsible to say the least, and with the stroke of a pen no less.  I am whole heartedly against it.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16663","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paul Ross","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.

I was treated like a common criminal and my voice was not heard. All they wanted was my private information which I gave and then I was afforded  no response back. I also signed the Dear Colleague letter with my full name so I hope you take my comment seriously.\nKratom should no be categorized as a schedule 1 drug. It has many health benefits with none of the side effects of many anti-depressants and opiates. I wont go into all the benefits since you now know what they are.\nI have been using Kratom in a tea for almost 4 years now. Before my naturopath told me about kratom I was taking 30mg oxycodone 4 times a day and 2 Soma muscle relaxers. Kratom came at the right time for me because I was in the process of signing up for social security disability. I have 3 bone spurs in my neck and osteoarthritis which keeps me in a constant state of pain. I already had surgery to remove one and I have a titanium plate in my neck. The doctor's advice for me now is pain management. After being introduced to Kratom, I went back to work full time and I can now take care of my family. \nThe pain medication the doctors put me on had horrible side effects. I never felt like myself and had horrible bouts of depression. All the pain killers did was mask the pain for a bit so I felt nothing and when it wore off I was in  more pain than I previously was. Pain medication is a vicious cycle creating more rebound pain. \nKratom does not get me high. It lessens the pain and doesn't take away my sense of clarity. It is very important for me to have clarity in my life and pain medication took that away from me.

My husband who is well known for NOT giving out narcotics has been very supportive in my use of Kratom as it is a very safe alternative to keep my pain at bay.  He would never approve of me taking anything that is a danger to me. I have quit taking it for weeks at a time on a few occasions with zero physiological or psychological issues.

Banning the plant will be completely ineffective in solving the very real problem of people taking illegal drugs or unscrupulous vendors adding illegal and/or dangerous substances to otherwise harmless plant matter, but will definitely hurt the many thousands of responsible adults who have been using kratom on a daily basis without incident for many years.\nI was stunned to hear of this proposed scheduling! I began using kratom in spring of 2016 as an addition to my arsenal in managing long term chronic low back pain that has been a part of my daily life since the late 1990's. This herb was mentioned in a master's (aka geezer) powerlifting forum as helping with chronic pain and arthritis. I was very skeptical of this substance I had never heard of before, since it seemed like it was too good to be true. However, after researching the possible benefits and risks associated, I placed an order with a reputable online vendor. I enjoy the tea, it tastes a lot like green tea, and is very soothing!\nBack in the 1990's when I first had really bad pain, my back specialist doctor said I had two options: 1) drugs. 2) surgery. I have a physically demanding job and cannot take narcotics or muscle relaxants. NSAIDS are not recommended for long term use. At that time the surgery was experimental, and he said there was very little chance it would help because the imaging tests did not show any structural defect that was the cause of my pain so would probably not be relieved by surgery. I left the office that day, went to my car, and cried. I felt so hopeless with the realization that my doctor could do nothing for me and that I would be spending the rest of my life in pain.\nWith no viable medical options, I sucked it up and just learned to live with the pain. The pain is not really bad most of the time, just constant low grade stiffness and pain, interrupted often with episodes of debilitating pain. \nOne really important thing I noticed as I took on the responsibility for managing this was strong correlation between mental stress and the pain in my back. Stress monitoring and mitigation is critical to keeping the pain at a low simmer. Physical activity is a very effective stress reliever, so I stayed physically fit and active throughout adulthood. \nAbout four years ago I took up weightlifting (powerlifting). My progress has been very slow due to the pain and stiffness in my lower back. I kept running up into a wall and could not progress past it without injury. Pain is a major impediment to moving the most muscle mass through a full, effective range of motion under sufficient load required to build strength (especially abdominal strength). Getting stronger has been the real key for managing the pain. I have not had a bad flare up in like 3 months! And kratom has definitely helped me achieve my physical fitness goals!\nThe way kratom works for me is complete pain relief! The feeling is calm yet energizing and the intensity is about the same as coffee, but without feeling jittery. I take it two or three times a week and my pain is GONE. The pain relief it is not at all like opioids. With an opioid, you are out of pain, but in a stupor, laying on the couch. With kratom, I am out of pain and doing chores or tackling a project. Recently I installed an aftermarket stereo to my Toyota LandCruiser after taking kratom. Working on a car, especially in and under dash work requires a lot of bending and contorting which would normally tick off my lumbar in no time, but I was able to work productively all day, pain free, completing the installation plus several other household chores, packing for our vacation, and watching a little football. Being free of pain, after so many years, is such joyful relief! \nYou may write me off as some nutty self-medicator who has willfully abandoned modern medicine. From my perspective, modern medicine abandoned me, long ago, and left me no option but to take care of myself as best as I can. As a scientist (BS in Chemistry), my hope is that modern medicine will learn more about pain response, especially chronic pain, and come up with a more holistic view of solving this complex problem.\nWhile I can live without this herb in my pain management plan (and if the ban goes through I will reluctantly get rid of what I have left), I am asking that the DEA cancel this wrongheaded, misguided and senseless action.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12805","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dana Drury","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A year ago my doctor prescribed paxil for my general anxiety disorder.

This is why they are being temporarily added. However, I feel that it is a clear act of overreaching in power and poor determination ability as the logic of that statement is as follows: We dont understand something so we are making it illegal. By applying this logic, the DEA is adding to the continued waste of the US taxpayers dollar towards the war on drugs that America has been losing since its inception. If the DEA feels that there is something to be learned from kratom and the substances within the plant, then it should be studied by an independent team first before adding it to Schedule I.\nKratom is helping so many people each day cope with a myriad of problems that otherwise would require turning to addictive prescription medications like hydrocodone or morphine. People have also used it as a way to beat addiction to other legal substances with high abuse potential like alcohol or nicotine products. Many use it to treat depression, including a large contingent of our military, and have found it a very successful alternative to their previous solution, suicide. Furthermore, there are still many Americans who are uninsured and will remain uninsured who can find a natural and safe alternative to expensive prescription medications that low-income families could never afford.\nIt also seems that the DEA is using false research and anecdotal evidence from the FDA and the CDC to come to this decision. Both have said that they have received reports of kratom intoxication. The CDC has reported US poison centers received 660 calls about reported exposure to kratom. Of those calls 50% had zero to minimal symptoms and only 41.7% had moderate effects that required some form of treatment. We have no evidence of what that treatment could be from their report, but many kratom users treat the effects with Ibuprofen and Pepto-bismol. So based off 5 years only 49 people have reported major symptoms that had been exposed to kratom, but we also have no evidence that kratom exposure was the cause for the effects. All we know is that they had exposure at some point. The report implies that they also could have ingested rat poison in addition to kratom. This is not qualification for a scientific determination and follows the same logic as the anti-vaccer campaigns. Furthermore, making a determination from a report from the Center for Disease Control implies that kratom is a disease. Kratom isnt a disease. Its a plant. The same logic can be applied to roses, or carrots, or pine trees. It is flawed and should not be a determination to further illegalize something misunderstood. I assume you have already but you can read the report from the CDC here: www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529a4.htm\nThe majority of kratom users whom I have spoken to have said that kratom is very difficult to abuse. Ingesting too much of it makes you quite nauseous and so your body forces you to stop ingesting it naturally. Our bodies have many built in blockers for such abuse and in this instance the DEA isnt doing anything our bodies wont do naturally, except for waste time, money and criminalize even more people who need a natural substance to help them with their problems.\nI am not a kratom user. I ingested a significant portion one time and it had zero effect on me. I mixed it with some tea. A friend of mine was with me and also ingested the same portion. He also had zero effects from it. None whatsoever. I am not writing you as a kratom user or someone who is abusing it or at risk of abusing it.  I am writing you because I feel that the DEA is overstepping their offices duties. They are not representing the American people nor are they putting American interests first. I can see no motivation for their action except to protect their own budgets or represent the major pharmaceutical companies who do have something to lose from kratom remaining legal. We know that major pharmaceutical companies do not always have their customers health in mind as evidenced by recent Mylan actions. I urge you to consider opposing the DEAs intent to ban kratom or delay it until hard, indisputable evidence can be found that the ban is necessary. I urge you to propose independent scientific and medical research into the effects, positive or negative, of kratom. I urge you to listen to the outpouring of stories from people who have used kratom to treat problems from opiate addiction, to depression, to chronic pain. I urge you to help us block this unethical, immoral and unconstitutional action.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10682","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Throngard","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"3 years ago I had my first child. I struggled with unexplainable symptoms during my pregnancy, some of which turned out to be the result of a brain aneurysm. Even after my sons birth, I still struggled with back & joint pain, along with severe headaches. But more than that, I fell into a deep post-partum depression; it kept me from having any desire to engage with life, or my new child. I stopped working, putting financial strain on my newly formed family. I did the bare minimum necessary to survive.\n\nOne night a friend offered me one of her prescription Oxycontin pills. I knew that without a prescription, taking it wasn't a good idea, but I was desperate, so I did. My physical pain was gone, and even more miraculously, my depression symptoms were greatly lessened. But of course, without a prescription, the only way I could access what seemed to be my only solution was to buy Oxy pills illegally. In addition to putting me at risk for arrest, doing so would have added to my family's financial strain. Even so, I continued to accept pills from a friend for a time. And though I was able to start working again, I was only able to function when on Oxy. If I ran out, all my symptoms came back full force, and I would either have to get more, or face withdrawl. Determined to stop using Oxy, I researched alternatives to narcotic/opiod pain relief. There weren't many options. Eventually I stumbled onto a forum discussing Kratom. \n\nIt seemed too good to be true; a 100% legal option that could not only relieve my pain, but could also help alleviate my depression symptoms, AND help me detox from a dangerous & illegal narcotic? And the solution was a plant; not a chemical cooked up in a lab, but something natural produced by the earth? I was skeptical, but still desperate, so I tried it. \n\nAnd when I say that I believe doing so saved my life, I am not exaggerating. Kratom saved my life. I truly believe that. It has allowed me to become a full participant in my own life again. To connect with my son and husband again. To live pain free, and to do so without the crippling weight of apathy and other depression symptoms weighing me down. I take Kratom daily, and while a perfectly effective pain reliever, I want to be clear that it is only a part of the treatment plan for my mental illness. I take it daily, but I do so in conjunction with therapy. \n\nMy life isn't perfect, but it's improvement since my discovery of Kratom is nothing short of incredible. I cannot stress enough the importance of having a safe, affordable, effective and accessible method of pain relief and mood support available. Please keep in mind that I am only one among thousands of people whose lives have been improved like mine by this miraculous plant. There are people who, like me, cannot afford or don't have access to healthcare from a Doctor who might be able to prescribe pain medications like vicodin or Oxy. For them, Kratom may be the only option. Not to mention that it is a much safer option than opiods. \n\nThe damaging long term side effects of taking something like Oxy have been well documented, as I'm sure the DEA is aware. Kratom comes with little to no risk of adverse side-effects or overdose. The DEA claims that the decision to place Kratom on the schedule 1 substance list was in part due to the fact that there were 15 Kratom related deaths between 2014-2016; however it is important to note that in most of those cases (such as 9 deaths in Sweden) the victims had also taken other substances (figures taken from http://www.snopes.com/kratom-banned-by-the-dea/). Compare this with the alarming number of prescription opiod related deaths (14,000 in 2014 alone, according to the cdc's own website--http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html) and it becomes clear that Kratom does not present a problem for this country, but a solution to what has become a dangerous epidemic. \n\nI implore the DEA to reexamine its conclusions about the supposed risks associated with Kratom use. Consider those conclusions in comparison with the well documented dangers of opiod use and abuse (keep in mind that Kratom is also less addictive than such drugs). Consider that there are real people, like me, who depend on Kratom every day. And know that, should the DEA choose to place it on the Schedule 1 substance list, those people will be put into awful situations, facing hard choices. How many of us will wind up pursuing some other method of pain relief illegally? How many will bankrupt their families in the process? How many will instead feel they have no option but to live with crippling pain or mental illness? \n\nIf the DEA truly cares about keeping the public safe, it will make every effort to ensure Kratom becomes more accessible, not less. \n\nThank you for your time and attention. I offer my gratitude in advance, as I trust that after carefully reviewing all relevant information, the DEA will make the right choice, indeed the only moral choice; and keep Kratom legal.

From when I had once been relegated to a chair or bed for lack of ability to move and start my day, I was now mobile and pain-free and able to be the family man I was so good at being before the attack. I strongly oppose the DEA and its intent to schedule kratom. Kratom is not a drug, and it is not addictive, a phenomenon I have experienced first hand. I believe that the DEA's intentions are good, and that they are acting in a manner consistent with their stated mission goals, but this plant has made such an incredibly positive impact on my life, as well as all of those brothers I served with, especially when the alternatives are the VA docs who will probably throw some benzos or opiates at you to make you go away. Even if all of this testimony were thrown out, the work that kratom can do for aiding opiate addicts is alone reason enough to begin working on this potential cure. My younger brother OD'd but I was able to save him, and now kratom continues to do that on a day to day basis","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9965","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Morgan Coffin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a natural way to help with my pain.

Three days, that is all the time left for a drug that saved my life. I was a freshman, excited to start a new year, and leave all the middle school drama behind. So you can imagine my shock when my life was overtaken by migraines that left me sobbing in the hallway, crumpled in a ball as teachers did the only thing they could. \nAre you okay? They would ask. \nY-yes \nI would reply, trying desperately to stop the tears for a matter of seconds. I'd tried all my options, taken Ibuprofen for long enough it made me sick, when my dad came across a new option, Kratom as a tea. He'd been through his own share of migraines, and usually ended up being the one shuffling me from appointment to appointment in search of better treatment options. \nThe last drug had helped, but then my doctor freaked out when I told her it didn't do enough to stop the pain. At that point, I left tears streaming down my face, holding onto my dad and telling him, Hold me. Do not let go, I don't know what I'll do. Ready to throw myself in front of a passing bus to stop the pain and hopelessness, I fought through tears, coughing and choking, nauseated but somehow still living. That is when I tried Kratom. \nIt was tea, dark and bitter green tea. My dad had read about it, then picked it up from the store. It was a life saver. I began to be able to stay in school, without having to focus solely on not allowing the pain to show. I began to enjoy living again, and actually go to school more than twice a week. Kratom ended the chronic insomnia, gave me the ability to think, the will to speak up about my needs. But now, they are going to ban it completely. Those people who are using it to be healthy, law abiding citizens will become criminals overnight. \nThis is the end of a drug that has helped many, and an end for the people who need it to survive. The end of life, for millions who use a plant to work, to stay in school, to make the world a better place; millions who will commit suicide because they chose to follow the law no matter the cost. We need these people in this world, and we can not lose without a fight. \nPlease do more research before baking a drug that has proven so useful.

I work full-time at a non-profit. I am a recovering alcoholic, and I have been taking kratom as part of my regimen of health supplements for the past 2 years. It has been tremendously helpful for me as I ween myself off alcohol. Alcohol was destroying my life. Kratom has been a god-send. I do not crave it when I do not take it. It provides a slight pick-me-up similar to coffee, and there are no negative effects from taking it, only positives. \n\nI also struggle daily with depression and anxiety. Often my depression and anxiety are so intense as to be debilitating, interfering with my ability to go about my daily business, go to work, attend social functions, etc. I used to use alcohol to cope with these issues, and the alcohol would just make everything worse. With kratom, I can cope with my depression and anxiety with no adverse side effects. Kratom helps me to be a productive member of society. Without it, my depression and anxiety will once again become unmanageable. \n\nPlease have compassion for us folks who struggle every day, just to live our lives. We are doing the best we can. Kratom helps us tremendously and doesn't destroy our lives in the process, like alcohol, or legitimately illegal substances such as pain pills or heroin. Kratom is not at all like these substances and should not be made illegal. Kratom is simply a tea, related to the coffee tree. \n\nAgain, when I do not take kratom, I have no withdrawal or craving. I simply begin to feel my chronic anxiety and depression again. Please, have compassion. Keep kratom legal for adults. Making this tea illegal will do nothing except make peoples' lives harder: people who already have enough on their plate just getting through each day in a positive and productive manner. \n\nThis is my final plea: have compassion for people dealing with depression, anxiety, alcoholism, and drug addiction. Keep kratom legal for adults. Please do not take away one of the best tools I have in my arsenal for living a normal life, with no drawbacks or negatives. This tea is pure positivity; it helps me live my life well. Please keep it legal. Thank you.

The fact that a legally available product is reported to severely diminish opioid withdrawal symptoms and aid a person's genuine efforts to quit using dangerous drugs is acutely promising.\n\nA corollary benefit to refraining from scheduling mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine is that consumers are able take action on their own to combat addiction. The social stigma surrounding drug addiction and treatment cannot be overstated. Compounded by the consideration that substance abuse treatment is prohibitively priced and often simply unavailable to many Americans, the self-empowerment obtained from managing one's own treatment can profoundly contribute to a healthy, drug-free mentality. It is for this reason that I implore the DEA not to schedule these substances in a manner which would necessitate a prescription for their use: the efficacy of autonomy in one's own treatment can be powerful and emancipating. It is imperative that Americans do not lose a potential avenue by which to take control of their own lives.\n\nThe DEA's move to solicit public comments regarding scheduling of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine is extremely heartening and is a testament to the sincere intentions of the DEA to hold the public's health and well-being at the utmost primacy of importance. Looking into the future, federal policy regarding these substances must be sustainable and it is crucial that the DEA sends a clear message to the many current and recovering addicts in this nation that these potentially life-saving substances will be a viable long-term self-treatment option. \n\nThank you for considering my comments as part of the DEA's renewed assessment of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.\n\nRespectfully,\nCaleb Hicks, Ph.D.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8990","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Caleb Hicks","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n  I am a former football player , kickboxer and bodybuilder. When I was younger I suffered some pretty terrible injuries. After my first surgery I was put on pain medication. I had no idea what a Percocet or Vicodin was. It was something my doctor told me to take in 2001. I was hooked on this poison until 2015. I tried so many different ways to get off them. When I would try I would feel like I was at deaths door. I had to work so I did t want to miss any pay. So I would end up taking them just to get right. Then I was introduced to Kratom. My transition from pain meds to Kratom was pretty painless. Now I'm back. I'm me again. I'm a law abiding citizen. I'm a business owner. A father and husband. I'm a positive contributor to society. Kratom saved my life. It's saving the lives of people around me that I introduced it to. This pain med epidemic is destroying lives and families. If Kratom is taken away these people will go back to what they desperately are trying to get away from. Please see it for what it is. The Kratom community is begging you to help us. I'm living proof that it will do good.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13157","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Violanzis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,\n\n   I am writing to ask you to please not place Kratom on the list of scheduled drugs. I am 47 years old & an animal welfare advocate. I'm also disabled. For almost seven years I was in and out of the hospital, dependent on a cane, walker, or wheelchair to get around, and in constant pain. Three years of pain management did nothing for me other than create more health issues due to the side effects. A little over a year ago, a friend suggested that I try Kratom. It changed my life. I am able to walk unassisted, perform basic every day tasks, even walk my dog short distances. My disabilities will not get better, I still have surgeries ahead, but I am no longer homebound. If Kratom is made a scheduled drug, my only option is to return to pain management, which scares me to death. I am under the care of doctors, where regular checkups and blood work have shown no ill effects from Kratom. I have never suffered withdrawals from Kratom. I support age restrictions for purchasing Kratom. I believe in purity standards, testing, and medical research. I do not think that Kratom should be sold in gas stations or smoke shops where minors could easily gain access. I am in favor of reasonable regulations. I am not in favor of a flat out ban on this beneficial plant based on fear of the unknown. Kratom has been used for millennia throughout the world and I deserve to be able to make decisions on what is best for my health. I thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19977","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Laura Jordan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"For the love of God7 !!

All you will accomplish by scheduling kratom is turning thousands of hard-working, tax-paying adults into criminals who will have to obtain kratom illegally. I'lll say it again for emphasis: you're turning otherwise good people -- law abiding citizens who are hurting nobody but possibly themselves -- into CRIMINALS. Please, put warning labels on kratom if you like, but don't threaten me with a gun and tell me what I can and cannot do with my own body.

I am a full time pastor serving in Santa Fe, NM.  I was diagnosed with bilateral polycystic Kidney disease nearly 30 years ago. I had been suffering from back pain for years and my doctor had me in 800 mg. Ibuprofen for my pain, \nDue to the fact the pain was constant and did not getting bettor or going away, my doctor scheduled me for an ultrasound and discovered that I had polycystic kidney disease. He immediately took me off of the ibuprofen and put me on Darvon. I was talking the Darvon three times daily to keep the pain at bay. Unfortunately, this caused me to become depressed and was not working that well, so after about 15 years my next doctor changed it to hydrocodone. This I was also taking two to three times a day. I suffered serious side effects such as constipation which caused increased pain. About four years ago I was introduce to Kratom and was amazed to find that it actually worked better for the pain and did not have the side effects of the hydrocodone.  It was so bad, that I was at the place of considering medical retirement before I found kratom.  Kratom It was a Godsend!  It allows me to function at a high level, while alleviating my depression and seriously helped with my pain.  It actually worked better that the hydrocodone. I was actually able to get off of the opioids  without any withdrawal symptoms.  \nIf you out law Kratom I will be forced to return to narcotic use and will probably not be able to continue working. I know some people abuse it, but why should people who have legitimate need, be punished because of those who do not?  I believe that Kratom is a gift from God, to help people in severe pain and depression, without making them slave to opioids. \nMy nephew almost died from a ruptured appendix, but was saved though surgery.  However, the surgery caused other complications such as intestinal adhesions.  These adhesions caused him excruciating pain.  They put him on Percocet which help with the pain, but also caused bowel blockage due to the narcotics. He was scheduled for another surgery and they attempted to fix the adhesion problems. However, due to side effects of the opioids, he was soon heading back to surgery again. I told him about Kratom and he tried it. Within days his bowels began to work properly and he is now able to manage the pain, without have the bowel blockages that kept occurring.  He was on the verge of death, that this natural plant changed his life.  He too, is terrified about the prospect of having to go back on opioids. Please do not sentence my nephew and people like me to a life of agony, opioid dependence, which will certainly lead to a shortened life.  \nI have read many university studies on this plant, and it has been show that it is not an opioid as some have claimed.   These studies also show that the side effects of kratom are nothing compared to those caused by the pharmaceuticals that get approved by the FDA.  \nThank you for your consideration of this issue.  I am praying that God will help you to see the harm you will inflict on good people trying to get by in a very difficult life. \nSincerely,\n\nPastor Eric Redic","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7764","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Redic","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm a 33 year old wife and mother of four, two having special needs.

There should be no prohibition. While the FDA is looking into it as well, most Americans have never heard of it. Why? Because there's NO REAL PROBLEM with it! Quite the contrary...\n\nKratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance.

It would be criminal to deny people their ability to heal themselves with this harmless beneficial herb. \n\nI have successfully earned two Masters Degrees, learned fluent German and Spanish, traveled extensively, and am currently a home owner and speech pathologist.  A few times a month, I experience heightened anxiety.  After researching Kratom, I discovered that if I drink a weak tea from kratom leaf powder with hot water, milk, and honey, I am able to breathe again and focus on my routine without experiencing the feelings of rising panic that otherwise make it more difficult for me to perform daily tasks on high-anxiety days.  I am grateful for the freedom I had to find an herb that could help me fight anxiety.  I have tried Kratom on a low-anxiety day, and it did not appear to affect me much, and I'm not interested in drinking it more often. \n\nI understand that unscrupulous sources of Kratom mix the ground leaf with harmful substances that have caused negative effects in a few dozen cases.  If Kratom needs regulation, it would be to prevent this type of fraud, but the solution is not to make Kratom leaf itself illegal.  For comparison, millions of citizens have died from using nicotine, alcohol, and legal pharmaceutical drugs.  Even laundry detergent has harmed thousands of children; Kratom has not caused this magnitude of problem, so to call it an \"imminent hazard\" is simply inaccurate.  On the contrarywhen Alabama made Kratom illegal, deaths from overdose increased!  \n\nI suspect pharmaceutical companies are complicit in the anti-Kratom movement.  Please do not allow corporations' bottom lines to trump individuals' ability to make choices about their health.  Please honor our experiences.\n\nThank you for extending the commentary period.  I hope you heed the country's feedback and keep Kratom legal and easily available.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20553","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paige Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to ask that Kratom not be placed on the Schedule I list.

And you cannot snort it. That is a huge potential in being a safer alternative,  every other drug like heroin,meth pharmecuticals opiates you can inject and snort.  Kratom can only be consumed orally or inhaled  by smoke.\n. it is very unlikely for someone to overdose on kratom because the more you take the less you will feel due to the tolerance . So feel free to keep taking kratom all day you wont get high like pain pills. \nKratom will end the opiate epidemic in america. as long as we keep it legal and easily access to these trusted vendors. \nDo the right thing people, Let our plants be free to us. they belong to us,they are here for us.

We only learn by studying from history what has and has not worked. Scheduling marijuana has had detrimental effects and essentially created a black market for a harmless drug (eg. Drug cartels, drug rings, etc) but more importantly impaired research to find the beneficial properties of the drug. I see a similar problem with kradom. \nWhile the adverse affects of the natural plant and it's benefits are not fully researched, scheduling it will lead to years of legal battles. Using simple logic and reason one can conclude that criminalizing a non lethal plant will lead to the incarceration of non-violent individuals. Criminals will be more enticed to deal kradom through the black markets because criminalization will undoubtedly increase its price. This invites dangerous individuals into a non-dangerous market essentially creating a problem that doesn't exists as of today. Incarceration for profit will surely be looked at more intensively if laws target non violent individuals and create laws that criminalize activities that don't harm others! Kradom causes no known side effects or consequences other than ones that closely resemble caffeine and ibuprofen.\nPerhaps the largest case that can be made for not scheduling kradom is for its propreties as an alternative to opiods. From pain killers to heroine, kradom has been known as a non lethal, no adverse side effects, alternative for individuals addicted to pain killers and opiods. For this reason alone, an immense amount of research should be put into this plant to maybe help end the opiod addiction that is gripping America. Doing anything in the contrary may be deemed as inhibiting progression of cures in order to keep Americans addicted to prescription pain killers and herione. \nWith the absence of adverse effects and a lack of research dedicated to the plant without a legitimate examination by the FDA, scheduling kradom is unconstitutional and has no just cause. Do not repeat the mistakes of the past. Please begin being the solution to healing the sick and fixing our justice system. LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE.\nps. I've never used kradom, only have known people using kradom. It's a miracle for those in pain. No addiction, pain relief and mood elation. Nothing wrong there.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7485","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Lynch","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life.

I have a degenerative condition of the joints which both restricts movement and is painful. In the past my physician has prescribed pain medications that contain hydrocodone and acetaminophen. As my condition worsened I became concerned about  increasing the frequency of use of this medication. Two years ago a friend recommended that I try kratom because it had helped her with arthritis problems. I did some research and decided to try kratom. It has worked remarkably well for me since. I prefer kraytom because it does not contain acetaminophen which I consider dangerous for long term use or hydrocodone, the risks of which are very well known. Kraytom is not as strong as these medications but it does give me the pain relief I need when working. If kraytom were no longer available, I would have to go back to the prescribed medication again and I don't want to do that for the reasons previously stated. I hope you will reconsider your position before making this medication that I and many others find so useful as well as safer than the available alternatives.\nSincerely, William F.

I am commenting to state that I strongly oppose the DEA scheduling of Kratom, or perhaps more accurately the scheduling of the alkaloids within the plant which would effectively ban the plant itself. At any rate I am strongly against this. I started using Kratom two years ago in November 2014 and have experienced a significant improvement in my quality of life since that time, and I give all of the credit for that to Kratom. I began developing significant physical and mental health issues over the course of a few years prior (2012-2014), and then a friend of 15+ years introduced me to Kratom. The physical problem I developed was arthritis in my back and neck and the mental problems developed were anxiety and mild depression. I have arthritis as a result of a Chiari malformation (which I had surgery to remove at age 5) which caused my spine to grow in a fashion similar to those with scoliosis. My arthritis caused me to develop the anxiety and depression. Kratom has literally helped me with all three issues on a daily basis for two years, and thus I absolutely think it should remain available to me and the public. As with many things there is a large online Kratom community so I know that I am not the only one Kratom has helped significantly. \n\nThis is a plant that can safely help so many people across the United States. It has great potential to help with physical and mental illness, I am living proof of that. It also has great potential to help heroin and opioid addicts get off those substances which there is no denying will take their life sooner or later. I know at least 3 people who are former opioid addicts thanks to Kratom. I want Kratom to remain available for my sake, and for the sake of everyone who has benefited and continually is benefiting from using Kratom. \n\nThank you for considering my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15808","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Potosky","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hey,\n\nI think kratom should be legal because it could help save lives.

Throughout most of my life, I have suffered with high levels of Anxiety, along with PTSD after years of abuse at the hands of my parents. I also deal with ADD focus issues, extreme case of Acid Reflux and chronic back pain. I have taken many pharmaceutical drugs for years to fix my issues, and it seems that no matter what I always have worse side effects after using for a while that pretty much rendors them useless. I have searched years for a natural herbal supplement to assist me in my constant struggle of just wanting to be normal. Finally three years ago, I found it. M.Speciosa is an amazing and helpful plant, I finally get the whole sense of relief without added side effects and I feel like I am the healthiest I have ever been. My PTSD Gone, My Pain, Gone, my anxiety, gone, even my acid reflux disappeared for the first time in 15 years. I no longer have to be a slave to the pharmaceutical industry that I tried to break for many many years. My religion is one of the earth, I only like putting natural herbal supplements into my body. i have searched for way to long for a government agency to come between me, and the medicine my God has put here for me. It was a very long and painful struggle and I just hope that you as a human being can feel the pain I have been through, and have a little compassion. This is no different than Coffee, as it is actually a decendant of coffee. Please do not impose on my religious freedom, that is what I ask of you today. I refuse to go back to how things were in the past, if only you knew what it was like to suffer, you would never even have made this an issue. We should never have to defend a safe, natural, and helpful plant that people are not getting high on. That alone and in itself is rediculous. All I ask is that you please let me continue living my finally happy life, so that I can have a family some day, and not have to constantly suffer in pain. If you take my herbal medicine away, you take away my future. Please gain some compassion and see that this whole thing is wrong! Thanks for reading.

I support a family of four on a single income as a Help Desk Tech. I have been to many doctors with little success for treatment. I have found that Kratom improves my quality of life after a hard days work. It isnt comparable to any drugs, marijuana, alcohol or other stimulants.  Kratom helps to improve my quality of life that I suffer with chronic pain. Please dont make this herb illegal. Cervical injections, botox injections, chiropractic care, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga exercises have not helped with my pain.\n \nKratom is a well-known, well-researched herbal substance drawn from the leaves of trees within the coffee family. The number of cases of documented harm from kratom use is remarkably low, both as an absolute matter and when considered against the extensive history of use of kratom, both inside and outside the United States\n \nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are two of the primary alkaloids of this plant. These two compounds are not synthetic and should not be lumped together with  \"bath salts\" or \"spice\".\n \nKratom has been used as a medicine by many people for thousands of years. It is a potent remedy for physical pain, anxiety and depression, and could be used to aid with opiate withdrawal by those who would like to quit using illicit drugs such as heroin. Kratom is NOT a hallucinogen and should not be classified as such. Adding mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as a Schedule I substance is rash and unjustified prohibition, resulting in a foreseeable increase in street drug-related crime, as well as a punishment to those who are currently using it responsibly to treat various ailments.\n\nThe reason that there are no deaths solely attributed to Kratom is because Kratom does not affect your respiratory capacity. It does not slow down your central nervous system. It's potential to do harm is virtually impossible.\n\nKratom has very limited recreational capacity.  The White House petition has over 100,000 signatures for the \"Please do not make Kratom a Schedule I Substance.\" \n\nThe federal government has invested significant resources to develop alternative pain management strategies. This includes a study funded by the National Institutes of Health in partnership with the University of Massachusetts and the University of Mississippi to investigate the use of Kratom as a remedy for opioid withdrawal. This study led the researchers to apply for a patent identifying the Kratom extract, mitragyinine, as a useful treatment for other addictive drugs besides opiate derivatives. The DEAs decision to place Kratom as a Schedule I substance will put a halt on federally funded research and innovation surrounding the treatment of individuals suffering from opioid and other addictionsa significant public health threat. Remember the DDear Colleague Letters of Senator Hatch and Congressman Mark Pocan.\n \nWe hope you realize the threat this scheduling causes the people seeking legitimate use of this special plant to improve our quality of life.

Below I have outlined a few of the arguments that support my stance.\n\n1) Kratom has already been legislated. This proposed emergency scheduling, while technically legal, is a gigantic misstep in the preservation of democracy. Numerous states have already made legislative decisions on the legality of kratom. This proposed scheduling plans to usurp those decisions and the will of the people who made them. \n\n2) Kratom is not an opiate. Kratom is an opioid, meaning it affects opioid receptors in the body. Endorphins, the chemical released during exercise, also affects these receptors. I hope this comparison makes clear just how big of a mistake it is to lump kratom in with opiates. \n\n3) Kratom is an unadulterated plant from the coffee family. It's not more of a \"drug\" than coffee. Most people make a tea with kratom and use it in the exact same way people use coffee. It helps them get through their work day by relieving minor aches and pains and providing a small pick me up. Hardly the demon it is being made out to be by uninformed people with no first hand experience.\n\n4) Kratom is safe. The small handful of deaths that have been attributed to kratom are a classic propaganda technique. Anyone who actually reads the reports will see that those deaths were caused by ingestion of Tramadol, a dangerous narcotic that somehow is scheduled lower than kratom - a tea - is proposed to be scheduled. No overdoses or deaths have EVER been attributed to kratom alone, to my knowledge. The citing of CDC numbers for calls about kratom is preposterous - even simple, safe, household cleansing agents have received staggeringly large amounts of calls. Even when taking into account the proportions of people drinking kratom, it's an incredibly low number. People are calling for information - not because kratom should be illegal. \n\n5) Normal people use kratom. I am an executive at a mid size tech company. I drink kratom tea at work because it's helpful for focus and getting work done. It has impacted my life in a hugely positive way. You who are reading this - imagine if the DEA decided, for seemingly no real reason, to schedule coffee as schedule 1. That is how I feel about this proposed scheduling.\n\n6) Kratom and opiate abuse - kratom's mild effects provide a small relief from the withdrawal of stronger opiates. It's not a replacement for opiates! By taking some of the pain and stress away from withdrawal, it allows people to quit without facing the full force of the most daunting aspect, the withdrawal. The unique properties of kratom, which gives a very mild uplift and pain reduction without the possibility of overdose, make it an incredibly valuable plant for our society. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression, which is what people die from when they overdose on opiates. Which makes sense, because it's not an opiate.\n\nThank you for reading my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4888","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Schumann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has been a positive in many people's lives.

A sober life that I simply thought was not possible for me.\n\nBetween the ages of 13 and 19, I was prescribed a plethora of medications. Often prescribed to take a variation or combination of anti-depressents, anti-psychotics, mood stabilizers, and hypnotics. In college, I was passing withs A's but the side effects of these medications were so unbearable that I eventually had to withdraw from school just ween off off them. It's been over 2 years since I withdrew from school and have been working full-time since then. Although I quit those medications, the symptoms of my Anxiety and Bi-Polar disorders only grew worse but I wrongly thought I could just ignore them. I ended up working my self to the bone at minimum wage and to slowly find myself trapped in various addictions. Mainly Alcohol, Cocaine, and prescription Opiates. When I had finally moved away in hopes of quitting cold turkey, I endured the full effects of acute opiate withdrawal until I found out about Kratom. \n\nThere was a convenient store nearby that sold the loose powdered form of Kratom and I found that even just a tiny bit of it (2-3 grams) could completely mask the pain and suffering I felt while withdrawing. In fact, I actually felt better. I was able to organize my room and search for jobs. With Kratom, I managed to pursue job interviews and actually secure two part time jobs within two weeks of being sober. A feat that simply could not have been possible with out the help of Kratom.\n\nI am now 3 months sober and continue to benefit from Kratom. As I progressed in my recovery, I learned that I would still have to deal with my pre-existing psychological disorders. However, I've found that certain strains of Kratom have allowed me to cope with my anxiety disorders. I am able to hold conversations, remain realistic yet positive, and have been able to mend some broken relationships with friends and family members. Kratom has even allowed me to quit smoking cigarettes!\n\nThank you, again, for allowing people like me to express our stories and concerns. I respectfully ask that you not place Kratom as a Schedule 1 substance as I feel it may do more harm than good.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDylan Flanagan","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5452","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dylan Flanagan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is the only thing that abled me to beat my decade long struggle with opiates. The effects of the plant are no more mind altering or stimulating than a cup of coffee. The reason it is so important and incredible is because it simply stops opiate cravings. The hardest part for a recovering addict is living life with a 24 hour craving for their chosen substance. But something about Kratom and the way it attaches itself to receptors actually puts a complete stop to it. I've seen people say Kratom helps with pain and anxiety, but I don't feel that at all, I simply use it because it makes me have no interest in taking opiates. It also helped me in the  initial process of quitting, and basically prevented any and all withdrawl symptoms. Please do the right thing and listen to the people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6560","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been addicted to hydrocodone, unprescribed for 6 years now.

I broke down and went to the fastclinic on October 24, 2016 (I loath doctors and all medications). They immediately sent me to the EMERGENCY ROOM. Long story short they put me on Oxycodone and it didn't even touch my middle-ear infection pain. Four days later the pain was worse then ever due to the Oxy. I was given an antibiotic and an anti-fungal also but I would not take them after reading about their insanely harmful side effects. I was still bound to ice cubes in my mouth and an ice pack on my ear 24/7. On October 28, 2016 I was going to go to the regular clinic but instead, I read about Kratom online and got a small bag locally. It made the pain bearable and it allowed me to know where it was coming from exactly, and exactly why it was so painful. \n\nThe pain was exactly like the pain you would feel if you were to squeeze a pimple, bump or lump on your body that isn't ready to come out through the surface of the skin yet. And the second that searing pain starts you stop squeezing and bounce around a few seconds until it is gone and say, \"I am not doing that again.\" That searing intense pain was happening inside my middle-ear and I could not jerk away or run from it... and believe me I TRIED!\n\nThe Kratom allowed me to understand what was happening, the infection was draining itself, and as a few hours past, the pain began to fade and I was able to drink hot tea and use a heating pad. Which allowed the infection to drain properly. I finally slept. Woke up and ate and have been pain and symptom free ever since. Before this I was starving and severely sleep deprived.\n\nKRATOM SAVED MY LIFE....

There are two subsets of patients to whom I have recommended Kratom, usually as an extract. The first subset involves patients who don't tolerate regular opioids secondary to side effects or sub-optimal pain relief. To my surprise, many have done well using Kratom extracts, sometimes in conjunction with medical marijuana. The other subset involves patients who have a history or opioid addiction. From what I have seen this group appears to do well with Kratom without triggering relapse. Of course this is anecdotal, but research could show that this Kratom is a viable alternative to regular opioids in this group of patients.>>>>>\n\nI work at a county hospital and many of my patients are low income which means that they have to pay for Kratom out of pocket. Despite this they continue to use Kratom because it has fewer side effects and seems to last longer requiring fewer doses per day and allows many of them to sleep through the night.>>>>>\n\nI notice that there are very few comments from clinicians. I believe this is because the majority of physicians have no knowledge of Kratom and its effects. Making Kratom Schedule I will keep this knowledge from them permanently. I believe that we should be aiming for the opposite effect. At a time when opioid addiction is rampant we should keep alternatives available and do the proper scientific research to see if this drug is truly safe and effective.>>>>>\n\nI urge you to refrain from scheduling Kratom at this moment. I realize that it can't currently be scheduled as Schedule II since it doesn't have a proven medical use, but if it is made Schedule I research will be exceedingly difficult to do. Making Kratom Schedule I will also deprive many patients of an alternative to Schedule II narcotics which have multiple documented serious and sometimes fatal side effects.>>>>>\n\nThank you for considering my comment.\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20306","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeffrey Roberts","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has the potential to fight opioid addiction and has no proven harmful side effects.

I have been in a relationship for over a year with someone who was addicted to heroin. Their habit controlled them completely, every aspect of his life was based on it. If he didn't have that drug in his system he was unable to cope with everyday life. Heroin has even killed him in the past and he still had to have it. The addiction was unmanageable and took a toll on him physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. He had tried the suboxone and subutex clinics and always ended up turning right back to heroin. Those clinics did nothing more than kept him addicted to opiates and after missing one appointment for a script he was right back at square one with withdraws just as bad as heroin. Reason for missing the script was because the cost of those doctor visits and prescriptions are very expensive and have to be paid in full at time of service. After reaching out to other recovering addicts on social media he came across 'kratom'. We did a lot of research on it and decided to try it out.. Its a natural plant grown from the earth, it had to be better than the alternative. Once he received his first order and started dosing the kratom the change in him was amazing. He could finally function. He got out of bed every morning and was involved in our daily life like any normal human being does. He didn't have any cravings for heroin, no withdraw symptoms of not having heroin, and was not high like heroin made him when he did it. It has changed him entirely as a person. Its made him feel like he can achieve what he deserves in life and he has a chance to be a model citizen in society. Heroin controlled him, it took away all his happiness and will to live. Even when he was high on it, it wasn't a pleasant experience for him. After being on it for so long it doesn't get you high, you just get the feeling of not hurting or feel sick.You still don't have the will to live like people not addicted have. Kratom gave him that will to live back. Kratom doesn't control him, it helps him control himself. Kratom removes all cravings for heroin, it releaves the body pain he has from being hep-c positive, it calms the symptoms from PTSD and helps him sleep better. Its also helped with his bi-polar 1 diagnoses and calmed down some of the mood swings and manic episodes. To lose kratom in his life would be devastating. For once over many years he has finally felt normal, hes finally progressing in life and even wants to better himself with schooling. He finally feels like he has control and can handle whatever life throws at him. Hes became very active in trying to help anyone who has an addiction to heroin or any other narcotic that has taken over their lives and teach them about the natural plant that helped save his life. Without this plant in his life I'm not sure where he would be, if he would even be alive. I know that being with him during his addiction to heroin and also being with him once he stopped the heroin and started the kratom was a difference like night and day. To take kratom away from him would be, honestly, life threatening. This all natural, God given plant has given this man his life back. Not once has he had any bad side effects from it, nor has he ever been unable to function because of it. I can NOT say the same about the alternatives like subutex or suboxone. I've seen with my own eyes over the past year of us being together what effects kratom has had on him and I cant even begin to put in to words the positive difference it has made. It was painful to love someone and see the hell they go through addicted to heroin. Not knowing if they were going to be okay, if they were even going to wake up to live another day. With kratom I know hes going to be okay, I know hes going to be here with me for many days, even years to come. I couldn't say that before, I honestly didn't know what each day held for us, if he was going to make it through that day or not. With kratom, there is no question, no worries, no more fear of what might happen. Kratom gave him life back. This plant saves lives. I ask of you to please not ban kratom, please do not take a God given plant away from people who are trying to better themselves the safest way possible.

After many long years of sacrifice on my part, over half my life spent separated from friends and family in order to do the bidding of the US Government; all of this wear, tear, and service related injuries have left me a chronic pain patient.  I have discussed my use of Kratom with my primary care physician AND my pain management specialist physician.  I have used this herb to manage my pain successfully for 15 years already, under a Doctor's care and monitoring.  The first 4 years I took Kratom my Doctor tested my blood and urine (first for a baseline test on my health) every 90 days in order to see if the herb was having any deleterious effects on my health. None were detected!  Since then I have been similarly tested every 6 months; after 15 years, no bad health effects from using Kratom responsibly.  My pain management specialist, in addition to spinal injections, prescribes me an allocation of (90) 7.5mg Hydrocodone pills each month.  However, he is constantly amazed that I only fill the prescription once every 3-4 months!  I can mostly manage my pain with the natural herb Kratom.  I personally know dozens of other veterans who use and prefer kratom to opioids.\n\nIf I loose access to kratom I'll have to fill that 90-pill prescription to hydrocodone every month, perhaps even ask for more. In addition, I would no longer be able to work, because I cannot drive while on the stupefying effects of prescription opioids. Scheduling kratom would  vastly increase your costs of keeping veterans healthy and pain free, because as it stands now, Kratom is not covered by medical insurance, so we (happily) pay the cost of the herbal medicine, rather than suffer the side effects of prescription opioid drugs. Once that option is taken away, you will experience an immediate and costly increase in expense to the American taxpayer to provide veterans with Tricare Military Retired  and/or Medicare medical benefits. There will be more doctors visits and more prescription drugs paid by taxpayers.\n\nI am not a  kid trying to find a \"loophole\" in the \"drug war\" for a legal high. Kratom has many benefits and few to no side effects - making it illegal is the wrong move: \n\tBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n\tIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up. This is an unnecessary expense for taxpayers to bear.\n\tKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement. Another benefit of taking the herb Kratom over prescription opoids, is that instead of causing me severe constipation (typical of prescription opoids), kratom the herb as taken whole (ground up plain dry leaf) has a LOT of fiber in it.  It relieves my pain; when water gets to it in my stomach, it becomes a large mass of fiber, helping to keep me regular.\n\tMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\tSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\tProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose. Even people like me who have a prescription to opioid drugs are at higher risk for accidental overdose by taking the pills, compared to using the herb kratom to manage pain. It's easy when under the stupefying influence of prescription drugs to \"forget\" you took a dose and take another pill. It's virtually impossible to forget you just choked down a bitter glass of kratom tea, and even if you do and take more kratom an overdose is almost impossible. \n\nI do believe that some minor regulation of kratom NOT involving scheduling, would be in the public interest. The following are my suggestions:\n1) The minimum age for purchasing and using kratom should be 21, like for alcohol. It is unlikely that anyone below that age would truly suffer from the type of pain that kratom is so good at relieving.\n2) Plain dry herb is very effective; high strength extracts (e.g. 50X or 100X) are unnecessary and ripe for abuse, and thus should be prohibited.\n3) Outdoor cultivation of kratom should be banned in the USA in order to avoid the possibility of introducing another non-native invasive species.\n\nUsing the dried leaf of the kratom plant, either by consuming it whole and unmodified (i.e. powdered and in capsules) or by making a simple tea beverage of plain leaf, must remain legal methods of administration (making a simple water-based tea must not be considered \"extraction\" by any law).  Kratom is a tropical tree in the Coffee family, and no more dangerous than coffee when used responsibly.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17286","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Johnson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant has helped me tremendously.

The problem that I have with the prescriptions are the side effects; depression meds have become ineffective over time and affect my sex life; ADHD meds are highly addictive; and the migraine medicine does not work for me. I have stopped taking all mess excepted the depression med and supplemented with kratom and exercise.\n\nI take kratom as a tea a few hours before bed. Taking it at night allows me to function during the day without the sedative affects if Kratom (however nice they are, but don't drive a car obit). The benefits last a couple of days et dose for me. This balanced with exercise was worked wonders for my mood. I am less agitated, don't get stuck in depressing thoughts, motivated, and am experiencing far less migraines than I have in 10 years.\n\nMy wife also uses Kratom. She has chronic pain as a result from a tick bite and back issues and is diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She avoids opiates because of the side effects and addictive properties. Kratom has given better option for pain management. Also, the Annie you relied for her has been great as well. I will let her submit her own comment.\n\nMy only issue with Kratom is that it tastes like $&@%. I would also like to see it controlled so that it is only available to adult 21+ unless prescribed and  people only get pure Kratom and not some chemistry science project.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10048","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern I would like to leave my comments regarding Kratom and how positively it's affected my life and my ability to function on a day to day basis.\nI'm 64 years old, never abused drugs (except for occasional pot smoking in college) of any type and I don't drink alcohol.\n\n BEFORE  KRATOM I took 800 mg Tramadol, 1200 mg Gabapentin, 800-1200 mg of ibuprofen and 12 Excedrin and 50 mg of Topomax\ndaily.  This as well as various triptans ( or ergotamines if I couldn't afford the triptans ) during migraines.\n\nCURRENTLY  I only take 120 mgs of Armour Thyroid and 3-5 gms of Kratom as a powdered leaf.\n\n I suffer from a chronic illness related to multiple sclerosis. Officially described as HHV6 of the CNS. Not only is the virus active but it's caused an autoimmune response. I've had it since 2003 and it is both painful and debilitating and has caused me great anguish.\nI've been treated with Valcyte to reduce the viral load and Rituxan to mediate the autoimmune response. My current physician is Andreas Kogelnik, MD and infectious disease specialist who practices in Mountain View California.\n\n Because of my illness I have had to take pain relieving drugs for many years and struggle with the usual host of symptoms associated with their use.\n At one point I was taking OxyContin 10mg 2xd, but because of the need to increase the dose and how incredibly addictive I'd heard the drug was I discontinued its use. To replace it,  are used tramadol and gabapentin along with various other over-the-counter analgesics such as ibuprofen, naproxen sodium and others. For the migraines are associated with my disease, I used a variety of triptans and ergot based drugs. Also many preventative drugs, calcium channel blockers, Topamax etc were tried. Along with Excedrin which is oddly the one drug that's proved somewhat effective in aborting the migraine after onset.\nAll the drugs that I used were prescribed by various neurologists and rheumatologists etc, and I used them according to directions and never abused them.\n With constant pain from the disease as well as up to 15 migraines a month, the drugs barely kept me functioning at a very minimal level.\nOne of my physicians, the now deceased  Harvey Caplan, M.D., suggested that I try various herbal drugs since the pharmaceutical drugs I was using we're not working very well.\nI tried various marijuana preparations and unfortunately they made my migraines worse. Then a very good friend ( a Rheumatiod arthritis sufferer) suggested Kratom. After several months I purchased some and tried it another several months later.\nI'll try to shorten this as much as I can but the bottom line was until I found kratom my life was a living hell. My migraines are currently down to about 3 a month. Still severe but because of the relatively short duration they are bearable. My mobility is about 50% increased from its pre Kratom level. I can walk without assistance and no longer use a crutch or cane. I wish I could say Kratom cured me. Of course, this is not the case. But it has increased my quality of life tremendously. Although I know that the statement from one person can be viewed as anecdotal, I have heard similar stories from many people. My only regret is that it took me so long to find something that has helped me as much as Kratom leaves have.\nPlease enter my statement into your record and feel free to contact me at any time regarding my experience with Kratom.\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nBarbara Brodsky\nbarbaralyn.brodsky@gmail.com","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20117","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Barbara Brodsky","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I started using kratom when I was trying to get off of narcotics.

The DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances could quite literally kill me, as before I learned of and tried kratom, I had suicidal thoughts daily, constantly asking myself whether or not life is worth being as much pain as I was in every single day of ever single year, and for the rest of my life according to every single doctor I've gone to. \n\nI started using kratom about 2 years ago, as my pain was becoming too much to bear when my doctor decided that she didn't want to give me tramadol any more. She didn't seem to understand that I am in pain literally every single second of my life, or she just didn't care. Apparently it's more important for me to \"not be addicted\" than it is for me to want to live. I looked online and saw a mention of kratom on a chronic pain forum, and decided I'd give it a try once I saw how many people were recommending it for pain relief. I was amazed, it was possible for me to actually have managable pain that I could live with, and eventually I realized that my slumps into depression and complete apathy were becoming few and far between, I appreciated the herb so much more. \n\nI need kratom to remain available because every doctor I've gone to has just told me that I'm doomed to literal endless pain for the rest of my life, but they always refuse to give me medication because they can't figure out what's wrong with me. Initially they thought it was a herniated disc, but even then the first doctor who said so wouldn't even give me medicine, the second gave me tramadol and refused to refill it, (though it barely worked at all, it was all I had at the time), and my third doctor just didn't care at all, and recommended me nothing. \n\nThis herb is not recreational for me. Kratom is my lifeline. It is LITERALLY the thing keeping me from killing myself. Banning it WILL be killing me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7408","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-27T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It really works for pain.

I have been taking Kratom for roughly 18 months.   I have a few painful medical conditions that prompted me to search online and see if there was anything that could help my quality life.  I didn't want to take deadly opiates, as I have seen quite a few articles mentioning that ~30,000 people die every year from taking opiates!  My loved ones depend on me too much to risk accidentally killing myself. \n\nAs I approached my late 20's and saw that more and more Facebook friends were dying, I was horrified to learn they died from opiates.  As somebody who lives with chronic pain, I understand the desire to eliminate or reduce the pain.  For some, this desire truly is \"at all costs\".  \n\nAfter doing more research on Kratom, I decided to give it a try.  It really did help my quality of life!  I urged my friends that take opiates to try kratom instead.  I have 3 friends that have switched from opiates to kratom, and they say they have never been happier! \n\nIf Kratom were to be made illegal, I fear that it would actually increase opiate & heroin overdoses because people will desire to take something (anything) that can make their pain lessen.  \n\nThe best outcome for public health would be for Kratom to be regulated as a dietary supplement.  Age restrictions, labeling requirements, and purity/contamination standards should be adopted to help consumers make an educated choice.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20875","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep Kratom legal and available for all Americans.

I couldn't move my neck, I couldn't do anything.  I thought I was going to overdose on Advil!!  We were heading to Chicago from Kansas City the day this happened, so I had no time to go to my doctor.  And, what was suppose to be an amazing trip was horrible for me.  I hurt so bad.  And I couldn't do anything to get it to go away.  I was so upset about my ruined trip.  When I got home I went to my doctor.  He sent me for an MRI and found out that I had  6 buldging discs in my cervical spine.  Automatically put me on pain killers, and steroids and sent me to pain management.  I went to physical therapy, I had epidurals in my neck.  It was terribly painful, and none of it helped.  My daughter was diagnosed with cancer in July of 2014 and we were inpatient 6 months.  Sleeping in a chair for 6 months was terrible for me, and she had so many issues, I couldn't get to my doctors appointments.  I couldn't get the medicine or the rest I needed.  2 years later I heard about kratom when the ban was announced.  It's been a life changer.  I feel like I did before I got hurt and my daughter got sick.  I'm currently on a tolerance reset break right now.  But this plant has been amazing for me.  I don't know where I would be without it.

When I was 18 years old and about ready to give up on life I was introduced to kratom for the first time. After trying it I immediately started to feel better mentally. I felt like myself. It was a miracle to put it simply. Every since then I have been doing great things for myself no longer afraid to be myself.

I have zero negative side effects after taking it so I don't understand why it would be put in the same drug category as heroin. This natural supplement has helped me in so many ways.

My hope is you will consider my testimony and the statements of testimony of many others before classifying this natural plant in such a dangerous and nonsensical category.  My story is as follows:  \n\nI had a horrific motorcycle accident in 1997 where all the nerves to my left arm were severed at the left neck area.  Since then I have tried not only practically every opiate derived pain medication available but also surgical procedures and surgically implanted devices at having some hope of relief to the horrific, chronic pain I suffer.   Devices such as a spinal cord stimulator and a morphine pump we're both implanted and since removed. I had high hopes for both of these surgeries but both left me with the sign chronic pain issues I had before they're placement and therefore I had them removed.  Likewise, over the past 19 years I have been prescribed practically every man-made opiate that has been on the market. Many times I have suffered not only the humiliation of being treated harshly by not only the doctors but the community because I have had to depend on prescribed pain medication for relief.  That relief, such as it was, came at a very high price in that my concentration and my overall sense of well-being and self-worth became more diminished the more became dependent I became on the pharmaceutical methods of relief.  Furthermore, no matter what medication I was prescribed I was always left with a substantial amount of pain and found it mostly just dulled my senses. \nI have a sister that suffers from fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue who several months ago told me about a natural plant that she had found and tried which substantially decreased her pain, gave her energy and all without the side effects of pharmaceutical pain medications. That plant is known as Kratom.  Despite her having raved to me about the wonders of this plant I was hesitant to try it because I myself had fallen victim to believing the lie that only man-made pharmaceuticals could relieve my pain. This was in spite of knowing the dangers and pitfalls of these pharmaceutical drugs. Thankfully, she didn't give up on trying to convince me to at least try it and gave me some of her own to sample.  That small amount of Kratom set on my table for months after I received it until Monday I was in so much pain that I gave it a try.   Needless to say, after that first try of the plant I was sold on it! I hope someday that I will never again have to depend on the dangerous drugs prescribed to me by my doctor but can't solely rely on the relief of this natural, god-given healing plant. I beg of you to consider my testimony along with all of the others I know Who have written to you with testimony of their own life changing experience with Kratom.  I have faith and will believe until proven otherwise that there are still those who care about society enough not to take this natural life changing substance from us.  Thank you sincerely for listening to my story and my concerns.\nGratefully yours,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16991","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Deborah Fleming","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It is highly unlikely Kratom is a real threat to public health; it has been used for centuries in Southeast Asia with minimal health repercussions.

It would be a mistake to take measures that would stall proper scientific research on something that may prove to help millions. However, more importantly, it would be potentially disastrous to the many lives that are currently finding help via kratom where other treatment options have failed. Removing this option will further devastate the lives of many people who have been unable to find relief elsewhere.

My name is Jake Edgington. I am a 36 year old Marine Veteran, currently working for Gordan Food Service out of Springfield, Ohio. My job is very physical as I deliver food and restaurant supplies to restaurant chains ( Pizza Hut, Chipoltle, ect.. ).   I have done this type of work since being honorably discharged in 2001. Along with this, I have been obsessed with weight training, eating healthy and optimizing personal performance since the age of 12.                                                                                              Unfortunately, injuries are almost always certain sooner or later. Six years ago my shoulders reached a point where the pain was always there and nothing I did was of much help, including long stints in physical therapy. My physician prescribed Percocet to me and I reluctantly started to use them. At first I only took them when I was working and the pain got severe. Before I knew it I was taking them as soon as I woke up because I would feel completely miserable if it was not in my system.                                                                     Five years after filling the first bottle, having tried so many times to get off of them with no success, I heard about the Kratom plant. I actually heard Joe Rogan and another gentleman with a similar situation to my own discussing it on his podcast.                               I ordered a small bag of it the next day and finally felt like I had an edge this time to kick It for good.                                                                                                                                The Kratom worked wonders for me. I used it a couple times a day while tapering down the opiates. Today I am opiate free and there is no doubt in my mind this would not be the case had I not found out about this plant.                                                                                        I sincerely hope that Kratom remains legal and similar stories to this quickly multiply. I would have never predicted I would end up one of the millions of opiate addicted Americans. It was absolutely the darkest and most depressing years of my life. I would never wish it on anyone. Kratom was my way out, my way of getting back to who I am proud to be. I know there are so many other good people in the same situation and I am confident this plant can and will get their life back on track.                                                                                         Thank you very much for listening to me and others. I hope it shines a little light on the actual reality of kratom.                                    Sincerely, Jacob M.

I am permanently disabled by chronic pain, poor sleep, unrelenting fatigue and increasingly limited mobility. \nI decided to try Kratom two weeks ago and I'm happy to report that it does indeed relieve my pain and fatigue and has helped my sleep quality improve. It's inexpensive in comparison to other options and has fewer side effects. The only side effect I have noticed is minor constipation which is easy to treat. It improved my mood and reduced my pain as effectively as most prescribed medications which, I can no longer tolerate. After taking the Kratom, I have also increased my level of activity.\nBased on my personal experience and the testimonials I have read by other individuals, I would highly recommend this supplement to anyone who is interested in managing their pain and improving their quality-of-life. This is not a dangerous substance when used appropriately. I think it would be a grievous error to ban this useful supplement.\"","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7264","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ian Scott","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"this plant helps a lot of people. it is fast growing and a great shade tree. even with out the  other help.

Putting Kratom on the Schedule 1 list akin to putting coffee on it.  \nIt astounds me that a substance which is primarily consumed by mature, responsible adults aged 30 and above, has no negative impact on mental acuity, coordination, has no abuse potential as a recreational drug as it lacks the intoxicating effects that commonly abused drugs possess, should be lumped into the same category. On the contrary many people find Kratom a safe substitute to opiate addiction. A case in point is a marked increase in opiate deaths after Alabama banned Kratom.\n\nIn contrast, Florida, in deciding on whether to place restrictions on Kratom found no reason to do so.  In a December 2015 report titled Kratom - Mitragyna Speciosa, The Impact to Florida it was determined that Kratom does not currently constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents. Additionally, the report sites that the Florida Department of Health found that there are no pervasive health issues which can be attributed to the ingestion of Kratom products in Florida.\n\nArbitrarily placing a relatively harmless substance which has shown to be safer than aspirin does little to serve the wellbeing and best interests of our society which the drug war is allegedly designed to protect. If anything, it undermines the mission and leads to speculation about the true motives of such an action. \n\nIn closing, Kratom should not be treated as a dangerous drug with a potential for addiction because it is it has so little in common with those types of drugs which are frequently abused, including prescription opioids. It does not produce a high of any sort, nor any of the withdrawal symptoms associated with alcohol or other drugs, and as such would be extremely unlikely candidate as a drug of choice for our nations youth. On the contrary, Kratom has shown to be beneficial help recovering addicts break their dependency on narcotics.  Considering this, and all the positive impact Kratom has had on so many lives, I urge that the proposed ban be reconsidered.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9313","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Croce","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Docket # DEA-442w \nMy name is Brett Blandino, I have been using kratom for one year now for my chronic pain and anxiety. I was taking Norco and clonopin every day And never had enough relief from my prescribed dose and started to take more. I knew I was heading into trouble but I needed some regular sleep and to not hurt as much. I tried other prescribed meds but they where worse and with horrible side effects. Also my career and ability to support my family was in jeopardy, you can't work or drive or function properly on powerful pain meds. When I found kratom I just couldn't believe it, no anxiety and my pain was gone. This herb was too good to be true, so I did a ton of research. With all the benifits this herb has and extremely few side effects I knew that this herb is what God intended for us to use. It is a divine intervention for opiate addiction, I have seen it work. We have too many people dying every day from opiates and if anyone knows those numbers it is the DEA. If you continue this attempt to make something as harmless as kratom illegal you will have more death and that blood will be on your hands. You have awaken the people to a problem with some of our federal agencies. If you want to continue to do business with my tax dollars why don't you concentrate on the reality that there is some bad stuff out there and we need it stopped. 99% of kratom users are law abiding citizens who just want to be normal. What am I going to tell my daughter when I don't have the strength to play with her, how many people face the same thing. I'm sorry honey but the DEA is trying to kill me with opiates because they don't make money from kratom. Make this your opportunity to do something good, be hero's, do the right thing for the children, especially the ones who now have a mom or dad because of a harmless herb. Don't you think that the children deserve this, or would you prefer a doped up bed ridden lump of flesh that is nothing but a burden on loved ones. KRATOM saves lives, please don't take them. In my year of kratom use I have never got high, in fact I try to stretch out my dosage for as long as I can. I take 2.5 to 3 grams 3 times a day so my mid day dose I wait until the pain is unbearable then I take it, that is not what an addictive substance does, and I know addiction having been a smoker for 40 years and I don't think I will ever be able to quit. I have stopped kratom 4 times in a year, I do this to keep my tolerance down, now that doesn't sound like an abusive drug to me. My insurance doesn't cover kratom so I try to keep my spending as low as I can but I'm sure you know that heroin is very easy to get and it's not very expensive. As a citizen I wonder why that is...isn't it your job. Don't you know that it will get worse if you ban kratom. Do you want to help drug cartels with more customers and bigger profits to fund terrorists, just think about the black market receiving from kratom if made illegal. You need to do the right thing and leave kratom alone, the world knows that your numbers are flawed when it comes to kratom. Just do the right thing and stop your scheduling and put more effort into keeping the bad stuff out of our country, be the hero that our children will admire and aspires to be. History will remember this, history will live on, be remembered for the good things that you have done. Keep kratom legal and save lives.  Thank you for your time.

I initially used kratom to wean myself off of a physical addiction to the legal and highly addictive opiate agonist, Tramadol, I found that kratom was extremely efficacious in allowing me to stop using Tramadol without the horrible withdrawals that had made quitting unthinkable, in addition, I found the herb to lift my mood (I suffer from depression and anxiety) and it allows me to work, and pay taxes without feeling drugged (again, I would rather not use prescription drugs for depression and anxiety.) \n\nWhen I was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2015 and needed an operation, I stopped using kratom for around a month with no problems or signs of physical dependence. I fact, I quickly ceased using the opioid pain killer prescribed after surgery and switched back to kratom as it is an excellent analgesic without causing the addiction problems of narcotics. To be honest, I find it surprising that anyone would consider that this ancient herb (I am talking about the pure leaf, from a tree that is a member of the coffee family, and similar to the tea leaves we use as a beverage) would even be considered as having \"recreational abuse\" potential since the effects of the herb is very subtle, and taking too much can be nauseating.\n\nTo conclude, the banning of kratom would have a negative impact on my life, as I have suggested, 8 years of almost daily use and I am perfectly healthy and working and feel better than I have in decades, and I find it significant that our close allies, the Canadians, have looked at kratom and have categorized it as a supplement, it is also legal throughout most of the EU. In short, I am a good example of a typical person who has found kratom and has been able to rid themselves of the need for deleterious drugs, and to throw off the shackles of chronic depression.

I was diagnosed at age 16 having degenerative disk disease, scoliosis, and sciatica. At first I was suggested to get a back surgery that has a 50% chance of leaving me in a wheelchair, so I decided not to opt for surgery. However, I had to deal with chronic pain problems. \n\nWhen I was 21 years old I was sent to a pain specialist. First I was prescribed Hydrocodone, which worked for the pain at first, but left me feeling intoxicated. Then the pain relief went away, and I was bumped up to higher dose, then to a different more powerful drug called Oxycodone, that also made me feel intoxicated, then the amount was increased, eventully I saw a problem and stopped the prescription drugs. The pain relief went away once I took myself off of it. I took myself off because I heard horrible stories about people becoming addicted and how they have to take increasing doses for it to work. It also started causing me stomach problems from the inactive ingredients. I would throw up blood from stomach ulcers almost every day. The doctor said there was no other choices.\n\n I did weeks of research on the computer, I then switched to plant based supplements to control my pain. I took willow bark which worked ok, but still had a lot of pain, so I added turmeric, which really also helped a lot, stil had pain at times, so I added a plant called devils claw, which also helps with the pain but even with all those, I was still in some pain, even though it had been reduced from 10 pain level to about 4. Which was good but not great. I still couldn't stand for long periods of time and needed a lot of aquatherapy to manage my pain. \n\n Then I found out about a plant based supplement called Kratom. The first time I tried it was the first time in my life I had been pain free, for as long as I could remember. I take Kratom now every day and have been for several years, and the amount I take never needs increasing and I have no side effects, it's non-intoxicating, and now I can live a normal life again. Do not try to take this away from me. I shouldn't have to remind you that supplements that have been sold and marketed as a dietary supplement from before 1994 are exempted by the FDA from regulations, in fact there is a store in NYC that has been importing and selling kratom for over 40 years. Not only that, but by prohibiting Kratom you are proving that the DEA is working alongside pharmaceutical companies to prevent people from using natural supplements instead of dangerous pharmaceutical drugs that kill hundreds of thousands of people a year. Please don't use your influence to create harm to people. Your job is to keep people safe, not put them in danger.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9710","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"casey joyce","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Schedule I drugs are claimed to have no medicinal value.

I and many others can attest to each of these claims. From experience, it is about on par with coffee in terms of its addictiveness and one does not get \"high\" from even very high doses.

I have literally lost friends and family members to heroin and opioid addiction. These people that are gone from us forever went through the ringer trying to get clean: courts,rehabs, 12 step programs etc. and none of them worked. \n\nMany addicts in their quest for sobriety and a normal life chose to switch over to synthetic alternatives such as suboxone only to find even longer and more pronounced withdrawals. As it stands now, there is NO viable answer for opioid dependence by traditional medicine or the institution. The answers we get from them are either highly potent and addictive substitutes in methadone or suboxone, or more jail time. Neither of these is an effective answer for society.\n\nOn another hand, we have a natural,legal, and safer plant that grows naturally and has extremely diminished abuse potential when compared to opioids. That plant is kratom. For me personally, it entirely eliminated all cravings for opioids and withdrawal symptoms within minutes of ingestion. Not only that but it also lifted the depression that was hanging over me for months trying to quit opiates and suboxone. For overcoming opiate dependence kratom is a more effective treatment than any pharmaceutical that we have available. I literally have hope for the future and my life back, and kratom was the plant that enabled me to get to this point. This plant can do so much good for others, I don't doubt that if it was more widely used it could greatly reduce the suffering felt by addicts, families, and communities nationwide. \n\nThis plant should be the number one choice for those quitting opiates. It should be available to anyone in the public. I'm not exaggerating when I say it literally got me off of the streets in Paterson as an addict. It can help others too. With this plant we can help addicts get back to society and back to productivity. To ban this substance would be to enable millions to suffer and cause social harm through using heroin and other opioids. I would liken it to treason upon your own people. \n\nGetting rid of this plant will only enable more heroin users. Heroin is both the most dangerous and most addictive street drug. It's the most evil substance and the most difficult to stop using due to excruciating withdrawals. This plant kratom helped me gain my humanity back, and I want to help the fellow suffering addicts and families get the same help. There is another way that's herbal and inexpensive!

I strongly oppose the DEA listing kratom on the list of schedule 1 substances. I have started using kratom about 5 years ago for muscle aches, pains, and neuropathy in my feet. Before I had found kratom, I was prescribed a cocktail of flexeril, tramadol, and an antil inflammatory. After a few years of using these medications, I had become concerned about the side effects. The flexeril had made me groggy every morning (I took it at night), the tramadol had come with the risk of seizures, and the anti-inflammatory had torn my stomach up. Plus, combining the flexeril and tramadol increased the risk for seizures. I started taking kratom about 5 years ago, dropped those prescriptions and never looked back since. Kratom takes care of the pain and it improves my mood. Taking those prescriptions, which only worked some of the time, had made me feel depressed. I have been called a pill popper in the past because of how often I would have to take these medications. On kratom, I take it once, maybe twice a day and I am free of pain, and do not feel like a pill popper at all! Making kratom a schedule 1 will leave me back to where I used to be and I never ever want to go back there. Please do not make this a scheduled anything. It WILL HURT a lot of people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1622","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Courtney Dick","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not Ban Kratom it is a harmless plant that helps many people keep it legal it has saved so many lives!

Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts.

But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick.

The federal government was never meant to ban anything and the states should individually decide what is to be legal and what is not. This is why there was a constitutional amendment needed to ban alcohol and again to remove the ban. I'm amazed at the blatant overreach and abuse of power that the citizens allow through all of the little unelected three letter agencies. Just because our so called representatives in congress have abdicated much of their authority to these agencies, that does not give those agencies the the power to legislate through regulations that exceed the constraints of the federal government laid out in the constitution. I do not understand how so many people in places of power within our government sit by and say nothing about how many of these regulations have no validity whatsoever. Kratom and marijuana in particular are far more benign than many of the substances that are legal nation wide and yet just because some of you in the government can personally justify their unconstitutional banning, we're all supposed to sit by and allow this to happen. Millions die from cancer through tobacco, tens of thousands die each year from pharmaceutical pain pills, alcohol destroys people's livers and families, and many antidepressant drugs actually say on the insert that they can cause homicidal or suicidal tendencies... I'm astounded that any of you can sit there with a straight face and tell us that as law abiding, tax paying, adult citizens that we cannot decide what to put into our own bodies. Especially any of you people within the DEA with your recent disgraceful, horrible, deceitful declaration that marijuana has zero medical benefit and must remain a schedule one drug. All of you should be ashamed of yourselves and are horrible human beings if you sit by and don't actively speak out about this. About half of the states have medical marijuana and many are starting to legalize recreational use. 60% of the country says it should be legal when polled and Kratom has been shown to actually help people get off of dangerous opiate pain pill addiction. I for one am tired of you people in the government financially raping me and stealing my money to fight a ridiculous war that you'll never win against a plant.

My liver values went worse and worse over the time up to the point that my doctor stopped the prescription of this mediaction. From that point I had to accept my strong pain which decreased my health-related quality of life massively.\nTwo years ago I discovered Kratom and tried it to relieve my pain on a natural way. Today I can say that this was the best decision of my entire life! I can go through everydays life with almost no pain which is a big advantage for me and my entire family. My blood is being analyzed regularly and even though I'm using Kratom often my liver values are much better than the years before when I had to take Tramadol. Even my doctor is deeply impressed by it's effect.\nSome people are concerned about a potential addicition. Of course there is a risk to become addictive to Kratom but from where I stand this chance is very low. I take Kratom almost every two days but when I notice that my pain is not very strong I can easily skip the consumption for a week until my pain gets worse again.\nIn my opinion the risk of getting addicted to Kratom is much lower than to any other pain reliever.\nIf you'd ban Kratom you would take millions of people who suffer under strong pain like I do the chance to live a normal life without ruining their health because they have to take other pain relievers.\n\nBest regards from Germany!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0773","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a recovering 27 year old heroin addict.

No one has died just from taking Kratom alone.\n\nKratom has helped me and my family and I see no reason for Kratom being banned, especially being put into schedule 1, that would put it into a category that states its has no medicinal value and should not be researched.

It was in the middle hours of the wee morning and I was in severe pain in my back couldn't sleep tossing and turning so I got up and I tried it and within 40-45 minutes I was able to go back to sleep and sleep through the rest of the night and every time I tried it I never felt any kind of druggie feeling -  just pure relief for which I was very grateful I am a chronic pain person I have been like this for 12 years due to severe car accident.   I moved to this little town in Missouri to be near my children as I'm aging thinking I could  take my scripts from Las Vegas Nevada bring them here show the doctors what I show them kind of pain medication my orthopedic surgeon had me on and they could look at my medical records and duplicate but no, these doctors here in pain management act like they are God they don't give pain medication out to anyone in this town unless you have cancer and you're dying I still am struggling trying to find a Doctor Who will help me as my neck and my lower back and my thoracic area are trashed from the car accident..   when I heard about  Kratom  it just happened to be on the very day the DEA ban it - I had never even heard about it.

So in my opinion I do believe that the DEA that is banning it or trying to again should at least stuff all ingested for themselves before they do that - that's just like with the pain management doctors who decide how much pain medication a chronic pain person needs when not one of those a-holes have ever experienced our type of pain \"chronic\"  they shouldn't even be allowed to be pain doctors they have no idea what they're talking about or what the person is really feeling shame on you all of you shame on you!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22430","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Norma Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In my personal opinion, Kratom has been very beneficial in my life and to other people.
