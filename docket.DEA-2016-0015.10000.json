Some veterans are overcome by the pain and use firearms to kill themselves.  Others experiment with drugs they can buy from illegal sources. And some have used kratom for pain relief, successfully.\n\nAll five Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) have been killing Iraq War veterans by selling them tablets of controlled substances that contain the high-potency narcotic Fentanyl.  The FDA has approved the sale of Fentanyl by prescription, in a product called the Duragesic Patch, a transdermal drug delivery system worn on the body, that slowly releases the medication into the body.  No US pharmaceutical company has asked FDA for permission to supply Fentanyl in tablet form, because of extreme concern for the likelihood that a patient could die by accidentally biting or cracking open, the tablet, which would cause an excessive amount of Fentanyl to enter the patient's bloodstream.\n\nThe narcotic tablets being sold by Mexican DTOs that are killing our veterans, are smuggled into the United States in violation of multiple laws, after manufacture in Mexico from ingredients imported from elsewhere and processed there, in facilities owned and operated by those DTOs, contrary to Mexican and US law.\n\nKratom is a stimulant.  Like coffee, energy drinks, ADHD medications, and decongestants, an excessive dose can cause extreme discomfort in sensitive individuals.  People with hypertension and those at risk of serotonin syndrome, such as those already taking a stimulant medication or taking an antidepressant drug that alters serotonin metabolism, can experience acute distress from serotonin syndrome when consuming any stimulant.  The physician who prescribes an antidepressant drug, is obligated to check for the occurrence of serotonin syndrome, as it often indicates that the patient no longer needs the antidepressant drug and should be weaned off it or should receive it at a reduced dosage. There have been several media reports of serotonin syndrome in Austin, Texas, to which firefighters responded and the patient spent several hours in the emergency room, receiving an anxiolytic drug and fluids, while recovering from the emergency.  Those reports drew media attention to the fact that ambulances responded, and to the fact that the patients had taken Kratom.  But what was not reported by media, was the fact that the patients got medical assistance that altered the other drugs they were taking, that  led them to reduce their overall consumption of stimulants.\n\nThe symptoms of serotonin syndrome are not pleasurable in the least. People who experience it, desire not to induce it again.  Accordingly, the emergencies associated with Kratom, do not affect the entire US population, but only are risks to people who take antidepressants at high doses.  Moreover, there is no likelihood that anyone will repeat the behavior that led to the emergency.  It's simply too unpleasant to experience a racing heartbeat, muscle tremors, nausea, vomiting, dry-heaving, a burning sensation in the throat from dehydration, and an inability to rest or find comfort for several hours.  Nobody feels euphoria by mixing stimulants with antidepressants.  Therefore, there's no reason why a person would develop a habit of it, whether with kratom or with coffee.\n\nDEA should encourage states to pursue research into kratom-based medicines that FDA can approve as drugs, and provide improved warnings for patients who use them with antidepressants.  Given the large numbers of veterans using kratom to ease pain, it's ludicrous to restrict interstate commerce in kratom, by scheduling it as a controlled substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20558","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Robert Schubring","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please study Kratom.

I am a cancer patient, suffering from a rare form of lymphoma, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulonemia, and have been prescribed Oxycodone by my oncologist for the bone pain that often accompanies this condition.  As you know, your own agency has made a concerted effort to curtail the dispensing of opiates by most doctors. As for myself, although I have a medically sound reason for taking Opiates, I do not wish to become addicted, and realize that even though I have legal access to them, the prescription pills become much less effective, the more you take. \n\nI discovered Kratom, started to use it, in very low quantities, and the results I got were astounding. I also have anemia, which is a by product of my cancer, causing me to be tired, listless, and generally just feeling rotten, and Kratom has allowed me to work, see customers, and be much more productive than I have been since I was diagnosed with cancer. I am self employed, so if I don't work, I cannot earn a living. I am a glass artist, working in architectural panels which are frequently very large and intricate. The process of building what I sell is very physical and requires concentration and a moderate amount of strength. I am on my feet all day, or as long as I can stand the pain, and Kratom allows me to work more hours than I could before.  I would also like to say that I do not use Kratom for \"getting high\", and actually don't know if that is even possible, but only use it to feel like a normal person again. I am so grateful that I stumbled upon it, and will be in despair if I am not allowed in the future to purchase and use it. Although, as I have previously stated, I do have a prescription for pain pills, I was beginning to notice that they were not addressing the sickness and exhaustion that I felt on a daily basis, and they were beginning to not be as effective at controlling my pain. Kratom helps with all of these symtoms, certainly not completely alleviating all of my symptom, but allowing me to make a living without working in agony, see my friends socially again, take care of my elderly mother, and just generally enjoy life more than I have in at least a decade. \n\nI am begging you to please consider what I hope are thousands of pro-Kratom letters; to make it illegal would be such a cruel thing to do to those of us who feel that we have finally found an (natural) answer to our prayers. How many people have died or seriously damaged their livers just from acetaminophen? My best friend's mother died two weeks ago exactly because she was in pain for 20 years, self medicated, and destroyed her liver with Tylenol. My point is that ANY drug, used in excess, no matter how innocuous it has seemed to be, can kill somebody. Does this mean that you want to make Tylenol, Aspirin, Advil and Alleve illegal?  You cannot dictate good sense to the public, no matter how much you, for all the right reasons, want to.  I won't even touch the subject of alcohol, death from alcohol poisoning, and death of innocents at the hands of those consuming alcohol and exhibiting poor judgement by driving. Are we going to try prohibition again?\n\nPlease don't take these comments in a negative way. I know that your agency exists to protect people, and you are not in the business of inflicting undue hardships on the public.  I appreciate the fact that you have looked into Kratom, and also appreciate that you have practiced judicious restraint and have issued a short \"stay of execution\", so to speak. I implore you to take pity on those of us who are really sick and could not otherwise have any degree of normalcy or productivity in our lives without Kratom. It truly is the only answer to so many of our problems, and I cannot imagine a life without it.\n\nThank you for allowing public input, and my ferverent hope is that you will understand the effect that banning Kratom will have. More sick people, resulting in more people applying for disability, more patients having to rely on \"pain clinics\" (and the very drugs that do cause deaths), more depression, and so on.\n\nSincerely,\nSuzy Pierron","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0911","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Suzy Pierron","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My kidneys cannot handle nsaids any longer and my chronic pain is sulking the life out of me .I am a 52 yr. old man with four young kids.I have severe arthritis in my hip and degenerative  arthritis in my back and neck.

On retirement I worked as a caregiver for several years but have retired from that as well now.\n\nI am writing because I strongly oppose the DEA putting kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances when it has been such a wonderful solution to many of my problems without any adverse effects whatsoever. My son is very health conscious and has read up extensively on kratom and many other natural remedies. He is very familiar with my health issues and suggested I try it about a year ago, which I did with great results. There aren't enough words to thank him for changing my life to a pain free one.\n\nSince I started using kratom I no longer am in constant pain from debilitating arthritis, my restless leg syndrome has disappeared, I sleep great since the constant pain is gone, and my digestive system couldn't be better. I previously had both knees replaced so I can assure you I know what serious arthritis pain feels like, After many discussions with my son about kratom and going online myself to hear other success stories, it certainly lived up to the claims of many others who have found similar relief without any side effects whatsoever. I am a responsible citizen and use kratom responsibly, so I beg you not to take away the only real relief from pain I have found in many, many years. I can't use serious drugs like oxycontin and hydrocodone due to awful side effects as I found out when my knees were replaced..nor do I want to spend my life having to use them as they are cost prohibitive. Kratom works perfectly, has no side effects, and is cost effective. \n\nPlease think of the millions of people who can benefit from setting aside strong, expensive medications which have horrible side effects in favor of a simple solution like kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19080","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Linda Westfeldt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In regards to the DEA's intent to schedule compounds in yhe kratom plant:\n\nI live in New Orleans - a city that is absolutely plagued by the opioid epidemic.  The daily reality of this looks like this:  I see nodded-out folks on the sidewalk every day when I ride through the French Quarter to work.  Ever since the fentanyl-laced heroin began pouring into town a few years ago, my community and my city have lost an incredible number of loved ones to overdose.  Currently a fashionable trend in the punk community is to purchase multiple doses of Narcan (which the city made legal for over-the-counter purchase because EMTs were reporting upwards of 10 overdose calls a day at the beginning of the year), just in the off chance someone might stop breathing in front of you.  Scheduling kratom will actually make this situation a lot more grim.  Low-income people with chronic pain will have one less relief cure in their toolkit.  Folks in recovery will have one less roadblock between them and relapse.  People are in pain, people are dying.  Also, I would hope that it goes without saying that our prisons are already full-up with nonviolent drug offenders and that the DEA would only be condemning more people to that hellish fate in the name of prohibition.  Both the past and the present prove that prohibition doesn't work; only harm reduction and decriminalization will change the trajectory of the country's undeniable opiate crisis.

I was prescribed pain killers following my surgery and only used those to the extent I needed.  I was fortunate enough to find Kratom to manage my pain.  I feel it is a safe way to reduce my chronic pain when over the counter medicine like Tylenol or ibuprofen cannot meet my needs.  I had considered asking my Doctor for a stronger prescription but I felt that is a slippery slope and I do not want to become dependent on pain killers.  I feel no dependency to Kratom and think this herbal supplement has great potential for personal use.  The proposed ban would certainly limit the ability to further research this great supplement and would force many people like me to ask their doctors for pain killer prescriptions.

Kratom left me clear-headed and lowered much of my depression, anxiety, and pain.

It would cause opiate drug use to increase greatly if the people who use it for pain suddenly had no options but to turn to opiates, when most just want to be off opiates, not physically and psychologically dependent upon them. Kratom is very mild. No slurring, no blank spots in memory that come with opiate use. No danger in driving. It leaves one clear-headed. Please do not schedule this plant.\n\n\nSincerely,\nKathlene H.

This would put Kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions, that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin.  It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown Kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nI have been dealing with back, neck and shoulder pain for more than 20 years and have been prescribed every pain killer that there is.  At first they seemed like a miracle, but after prolonged use I became fully aware of the dangers of prescription drugs.  Mitragyna Speciosa, more commonly known as Kratom, was recommended to me in early 2016 as an all-natural, herbal option to the traditional pain medications currently plaguing  our country.  I began researching this wonderful, healthy alternative dietary supplement and after reading scores of personal stories, research papers and articles, I decided to try it out.  As a result, I have finally found a way to live a normal life free from almost all of my constant, physical pain.\n\nI take Kratom, as needed, to help me through flare ups and then stop all together when I dont need it; this is extremely difficult to do with doctor prescribed pain killers.  Kratom has become an integral part of my life and to say I am distraught by this recent announcement from the DEA is putting it mildly.  PLEASE stop this from being banned for the millions who have regained control of their lives because of Kratom.\n\nSimply put, there is no evidence to support a ban.  Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and it has changed my life.  The Kratom community is all for making it a regulated dietary ingredient.  I fear a ban by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic.  I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without Kratom.  I will suffer and many will suffer far more.  You can stop this.\n\nIf you have questions about Kratom, please visit www.americankratom.org.

I had used vicodin off and on to help get through the worst parts of this pain but with unwanted side effects. I then had a foot surgery that left me with intense daily pain in my left foot. This pain changed my life in such a negative way I was forced to seek relief. I had to use vicodin to make it through my surgery and worst days of pain  that occurred several times per week. I then discovered Kratom and dropped vicodin and was free of the negative side effects and dependency. The ability to treat my pain is the difference in many of my physical activities and well being. Having this natural pain relieving solution is of huge positive benefit to my staying off of any opiates and having the ability to do my daily work without breaks, days off and limited performance capability. \nI have used successfully used Kratom as an alternative to  painkillers and been able to live a balanced healthy life without the side effects of the other relief methods that are available to me. The thought that using Kratom will be illegal is a nightmare for me and many other law abiding citizens., I do not want to have to be considered a criminal for needing pain relief. The thought that yet another drug law regarding a natural substance that does way more good than harm is frustrating and confusing, Our country has a real drug problem with the outbreak of opiates. Kratom is a safe alternative and also a critical piece of medical research that will help end this nightmare opium addiction outbreak. Using the criminal justice system to control a leaf of a plant that helps so many millions of people is a outrage and horrible application of the time and energy of the DEA. The DEA should be there to protect people and not be in a position to put them in legal peril because they are hurting. \nI am asking you to please lift the Kratom ban and responsibly use the power you have to regulate the substance so it is safe and legal and available to those of us that use it responsibly. This is a issue that will have a huge impact on me and I urge you to consider the law abiding decent people who will be seriously compromised and hurt by this new drug law.\nPlease help regulate this substance and do not ban it, our country should not be making laws that make otherwise innocent productive people into outlaws.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this issue. I am a retired school teacher who had back surgery in 1999. I was prescribed many pills including m.s. contin and vicodin. I was not warned of the potential for addiction and had never liked taking medication including aspirin, but I followed my doctors orders as my pain was severe. I took the m.s. contin for about 9 months and stopped. I was very agitated and the doctor was shocked that I had just stopped and asked me how that week was. I was not aware I had experienced withdrawals. This was nothing compared to the vicodin. I had to do an extremely slow taper that took almost a year. It was extremely uncomfortable. During the years I was taking these medications I could not do much. I could not work or drive. I spent most of my time asleep. I gained over 100 pounds. I lost all my friends. I was very depressed. The worst part was I was still in pain. Those were the worst years of my life. I eventually got better, mostly due to physical therapy. I lost about 40 pounds. I went back to work but still had pain almost every day. Some days were so bad I would wear a TENs unit and use ice a lot. After about 10 years of working full time I started having back problems again. After MRIs were taken I found out the discs above the surgery were now having issues. It got so bad I had injections, physical therapy and more pills. At first I said I did not want any pills but my pain was just too much. I only took the pills occasionally as I had been down that road before. The doctors decided nothing was working and wanted me to join their chronic pain clinic. It meant pills and classes three times a week three hours each time. I refused as I did not want to take pills and could not possibly do three hours of anything without being on ice flat on my back. I started investigating natural options. This is when I found kratom. Kratom took the edge off my pain and got me out of bed and walking. I lost the rest of the weight I had gained on opiates. I joined the YMCA to use the pool. I still have pain every day but now kratom helps and makes me feel better. I even eat healthier now and my lab results have been excellent. I have not seen my back doctor in about three years. I now go to acupunture. I do not need opiates. Please do not take this herbal supplement, my cup of tea, away from me. I do think there should be an age limit as to who is able to take it and safe directions on usage. Much like other herbal supplements.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17292","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 50 years old and have had 8 surgeries including cervical spine surgery with fusion and have a metal plate in my neck, rotator cuff surgery twice on the same arm and have a metal anchor holding it together, a hysterectomy, hernia surgery, gallbladder surgery and breast surgery along with tendinitis in both shoulders, degerative disc disease in several discs in my neck and back and have fibromyalgia. I went to pain management for 9 years for chronic pain and all that did was take the edge off the major pain and I took everything from Fentynal to methadone and Percocet. Then one day I decided I just didn't want to do it anymore but knew I would get sick because my body would go through major withdrawal. Thankfully only my body was addicted and I wasn't. However the withdrawal was horrible and my doctor said I would feel like I was going to die and I did. A nurse friend of mine told me about Kratom and took me for my first cup of tea. I also bought an ounce and made a gallon of my own tea for home. Within days my withdrawals were gone and so was my pain. It's been over a year now and I haven't taken a pain pill once. If it wasn't for Kratom I would live in massive pain. I make my own tea and drink it as need throughout the day. It's not addicting and you can't overdose on it because if you take too much, it will make you nauseous. If Kratom is made illegal, I will be forced to go back to taking pain medication which is the worst thing I would ever want to do and very dangerous and addicting.

Daily life is full of back-to-back responsibilities to support my life and my family - financially, emotionally, and by staying healthy to manage my condition.  My life is full of blessings but also stressors.  Keeping up the pace required to live this life is always a challenge.\n\nA friend of mine, who is also a father and a diabetic introduced me to kratom about a year ago.  Simply put, kratom makes me a better person - a better husband, father, and diabetic.  When I take kratom after a day of work, I can play with my kids, make them dinner, put them to sleep, take an 8 mile run, clean up the house, catch up on emails, and do it all with a smile on my face while still getting to sleep at a reasonable hour and getting a good night's rest.  Kratom gives me the energy to knock down my to-do list with enthusiasm, without any intoxicating effects and no side effects other than a very mild \"hangover\" if I take too much.  Kratom isn't something I mix with alcohol or use to \"party\" - as a matter of fact, when I take kratom, I have no desire to have a drink even in social settings where alcohol is present.  This is a good thing because alcohol has adverse effects on my diabetes - whereas taking kratom only benefits my condition because when I take kratom I am motivated to exercise, and I make good dietary choices because food tends to taste better.  If I have a long to-do list around the house, I can take kratom and blast through it with vigor.  And my ability to take long and sustained runs is significantly increased, because of the combination of pain relief (no joint pain) and the enjoyment of pushing myself while doing something mundane that kratom remarkably seems to enhance.\n\nAll I can say is, kratom is not a drug.  Kratom is a supplement that I use to be the best possible version of myself.  Without kratom, I would not be able to maintain my work life, family life, and exercise regiment at the level that I have in the last year.  And I'd hate to lose that ability - especially since the thing giving me the ability to perform at this level is a PLANT.  Truly a testament to the beauty and power of nature.  We should embrace kratom's ability to enhance the human experience.  I know I do - my life is better because of it, and my contributions to my family and my health are as well.  I feel that kratom is truly a blessing, something that should be revered and certainly not restricted.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1006","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"JOSEPH BURNETT","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from epilepsy and degenerative disc disease.\nKratom has helped improve my quality of life tremendously.\nKratom has helped my pain and improved my mood significantly.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7822","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gina Artruc","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom saved my life, I'm able to have a functional life that is not co-dependent on alcohol and able to go to school and better myself each day with the help of Kratom.

I have been doing this job for the last sixteen years.  It is my professional opinion that the herbal supplement called Kratom should not be a controlled substance.\n\nMost people don't know much or even anything about this herbal supplement, which hasn't been widely exposed in the media until recent months. I myself did not know anything about it until three years ago when my wife started drinking Kratom tea to help ease the symptoms of a medical condition involving flares of physical pain.  Before long, my wife was able to decrease and then altogether eliminate the use of \"heavy\" medication prescribed by a doctor for her condition.  She has been a happier and healthier person as a result of Kratom.\n\nI want to share the facts of \"the war on drugs\" with you as I see it from the front lines.\n\nUse of \"brown tar\" heroin in the Northwestern United States has grown to alarming rates within the last few years.  Daily I encounter individuals who are actively using heroin and/or crystal methamphetamine on regular basis.  Many of these citizens start use of illegal drugs after they get addicted to prescription medication.  Their lives and families are destroyed.  Getting clean is easier said than done for these people.  As a result, they turn into career criminals by stealing from retailers, breaking into people's homes and mailboxes, creating and cashing counterfeit bank checks, robbing people on the street, and so forth.\n\nPeople who take Kratom, on the other hand, are doing none of these things.  This is part of why this supplement is not more widely known: the people who take it are living ordinary lives that don't attract police attention.\n\nBased on facts that I know, Kratom has been discovered as one of the only natural substances that has proven to be effective and safe to assist the process of kicking abuse habits of \"heavy\" drugs, whether legal or not.  Another fact is that I have never encountered or heard of anyone being seriously hurt or dying because of kratom.  For whatever reason, DEA's statements about this herbal natural product have been grossly misleading. Please know that Kratom is a relative of coffee plants.  Apparently being \"addicted\" to Kratom is very similar to being a habitual coffee drinker.\n\nI respectfully ask that Kratom not be banned or criminalized.  If DEA persists with this attempt to make Kratom a controlled substance, thousands of citizens who include our military veterans will suffer greatly.  Instead of allowing scientists to research uses of Kratom and allowing this supplement to be sold in your neighborhood vitamin store, all of Kratom's production, distribution, and sales will be given over to the black market.  I have no doubt that sales of Kratom WILL continue if a ban goes into effect; only this time it will be run by organized crime.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11218","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"After many years of norcos, tramadol, klodipine, fluocseteene and others you life is for the most part over during that time period.

I would like to say a few things about how kratom has done wonders inmy life. Years ago I was injured working on the police force. I sustained  a broken shoulder and disc herniation in my back. The doctors put me on several medications. Oxycontin, percocet, soma, .....i took the medication for 12 years and became very dependent to them. I was taking more and more , and when i didnt have them i went through horrible feelings. A friend of mine told me about Kratom, and i researched it . I went and purchased it and felt great effects instantly. I was happy again, energized, not in pain, woke up feeling great , not groggy. I used to take 20-30 pills of medication a day . And now since i use Kratom i dont use any medication anymore. I love this stuff. After 12 years, i finally feel good, normal , and have a great life once again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5754","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"LUCY Marine","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was a iv drug user for anything I could get my hands on my family had found kratom and instead of going on methadone or other toxins that I would continously fall off the wagon from I started kratom I have been clean 2 months it also helps my neck and back pain helps me get up and look forward to life again","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16412","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"John Breedlove","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to request that you do not put kratom into the schedule one list of drugs, this making it illegal.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a minor in Psychology. Before I became too chronically ill to work I was employed as an Admistrative Assistant in the 2-year college system for ten years. My health deteriorated and I became bedridden at times with a very low quality of life.\n\nTwo years ago I learned of a plant called kratom through a chronic pain support group and I began my research into this plant. After extensively researching all aspects of this plant I decided that I would give this all-natural plant a try in an effort to better my quality of life.\n\nOver the past 20 years I have been diagnosed with the following conditions: Major Depressive Disorder; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Panic Attacks; PTSD;  Social Anxiety Disorder; Generalized Mood Disorder; Attention Deficit Disorder; Fibromyalgia; Chronic Fatigue Immue Deficiency; Sjogren's Syndrome; Moderate to Severe Arthritis; Degenerative Disc Disease of my spine and neck (L1 & L2; C5 - C7) with bulging discs; Carpal Tunnel in both wrists; and Fibrosis of my left thumb.\n\nI have been through numerous nerve blocks and injections to no avail. I have been on more psychotropic medications than any one person should ever be prescribed. I have had extensive cognitive therapy counseling including a partialized hospitalization program and also individualized cognitive behavior therapy with little results. More prescription drugs were prescribed that left me feeling drugged, sad, and lethargic. Since then I have had a mixture of prescription medications for my physical and mental pain changed and then changed again and again. I became more depressed and virtually unable to leave my house. The prescription drugs were ineffective and the side effects seemed to make my health worse.\n\nA year ago I began kratom as a dietary supplement. I no longer woke up every morning dreading life. I was no longer a prisoner to my chronic conditions. I was no longer too drugged to function. I still had physical pain. I still had mental pain. The difference being with kratom I was clear headed. I no longer spent my days bedridden. I was no longer a recluse. I became a functioning member of society for the first time in too many years. I was able to exercise, help care for my parents and my precious 95 year old grandmother. I was active in my son's extracurricular activities including being a \"team mom\" for his middle school baseball team. I was so grateful for finally feeling like a real, normal person again.\n\nKratom gave me a new chance at life and it is imperative this dietary supplement be available for people like me. The list of medications I no longer had to take included everything from anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medications to pain management medications.\n\nKratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. \n\nUnfortunately legislation in my State was passed to ban kratom. I was able to stop kratom as part of my all natural treatment for my conditions without any of the dangerous side effects or withdrawals caused from stopping my former prescription medications. \n\nThank you for allowing my testimony.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19027","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mindy Sexton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is far less harmful than many legal drugs (even OTC ones).

I believe the DEA has overreached its authority and shouldn't be able to make a law that will affect millions of people without Congressional or public input.  I hope my story can shed some light on how devastating it would be to make this plant illegal and unavailable to the hundreds of thousands of Americans that use it therapeutically.\n\nI am a survivor of traumatic abuse that I endured the first 12 years of my life and I lost my mom at age 5. I was then put in custody of the state where I was moved around through the foster care system and lived in multiple shelters and temporary housing until I was 18. I have struggled my whole life, especially as an adult after I started my own family, with PTSD and severe anxiety stemming from my youth. Any trauma survivor with these conditions can tell you that the burden and struggle to live life fully, or even normally, is a constant uphill battle. There are NO pharmacological medications made today that can address these issues because of their nature of manifesting different for everyone. I went down that road numerous times seeking relief from the constant agony, never being able to find what worked for me. Some days can be completely debilitating, it could last hours, days or weeks depending on the situation and I never slept. Everyone's 'triggers' and consequential reactions can not be addressed with one kind of pill or a cabinet full of different pills. Very sadly PTSD can destroy the most joyous of lives & have a devastating effect on the entire family, many times tearing everyone apart. \n\nI also have severe osteoarthritis in my knees and have been told after many surgeries and temporary treatments that my time for needing knee replacements will come early in life. I am only 44 and a single mom raising two young boys, this news was terrible. The simple struggle to go up and down the stairs became very hard and I limped constantly after the simplest of activities. I could not become disabled because there would be no way to care for my children, but I started to feel like the cards were stacked against me. I did not want to ever take heavy painkillers for fear of addiction but my options were all pointing me in that direction. \n\nIn my desperation for relief and healing, I started seeking alternative treatments, traveling even to other parts of the world to get treatments with natural, holistic, plant medicine. Slowly after several years and tuns of research into the healing world of natural plant remedies, I came upon Kratom, and dove into the long history it has had as a very powerful healer. After about a month of reading I decided to try it and see if it could help and I started a daily regimen, using a small amount through the day as tea. My results were almost immediate and unlike anything I had ever tried. The pain relief was immediate and my anxiety lowered. Day by day my activity level went up and my experience of life became manageable, I started being able to do all my daily tasks with ease, focus and joy instead of a constant struggle. After a few months I was no longer living in the reactionary state that I had been in for so many years with the PTSD. Over time I have slowly started to have an entirely new experience of my day, being able to experience everything as it is meant to be, I am learning how to live without suffering all because of Kratom. I no longer take any medication, go to endless doctors, and I can even ride my bike again. Kratom has given me back these tender years with my children, my sleep, my health and most of all, mental well being. \n\nAll of this will be taken away from me and many other innocent people who are trying so hard to live a healthy productive life. Many of the brave men and women who have devoted themselves to the United States and sustained the suffering of PTSD through war, could potentially no longer have relief if Kratom is currently a part of their therapy. The toll from PTSD, anxiety, chronic pain, and depression is at epidemic proportions within our nation. For each person who suffers with these conditions there is also a circle of family and friends that feels the effects in a sad and hurtful way. Many people become completely disabled, families fall apart, and people become a drain on our already overburdened economy. Many people will turn to deadly painkillers, alcohol and hard drugs to escape the agony, most of the time ending with devastating results.   \n\nPlease, look at all the good this simple plant can do, and truthfully I have not covered all the healing properties it has. Taking this plant away will leave me and countless others in a life of suffering. Countless people that simply want to live a peaceful, productive life! Kratom is used for healing people with drug and alcohol addictions too. A plant has come along that can heal so many hundreds of thousands of Americans, don't take it away in blind ignorance.\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13515","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 45 year old mother of six beautiful children. In my life I've had many accomplishments besides the joys of motherhood including becoming a published children's author/illustrator and a well recognized news correspondent for the Pocono Record. My life was completely stripped away from me for many years due to chronic pain caused by many various health issues. Some of my ailments include epilepsy,  buldging herniated discs,  fibromyalgia,  insomnia,  anxiety, depression and more. For years I have suffered and practically became totally bedridden with no quality of life to speak of. For many years I tried the to seek relief by pharmaceutical medicines like narcotic pain medications, antidepressants and narcotic anti anxiety medications. All of those caused me to become a person that my own family did not want to be around. My own children begged me to try my best to find an alternative. I finally found kratom and since the first day I made my first cup of tea my life has completely changed for the better. Actually better than I could have ever imagined!  I also have a life threatening condition called C-Diff. It's a severe intestinal infection that caused complete loss of appetite with chronic diarrhea and pain. I was hospitalized when I got down to 80lbs when the doctor warned me that I would lose my life if I continued to lose weight since my body was being robbed from any nourishment what so ever. They tried many medications to no avail. Within four months of drinking kratom tea I had completely gained all of the weight back and have no symptoms at all anymore! My entire family is behind keeping this miracle plant legal. They're proud to say \" We finally have our mom back\"! Now I have a full life again and look very forward to my future. I no longer feel like I'm just existing, I'm living again!!! Now I will be able to be the wife, mom, daughter and grandmother again that I desperately wanted to be.

A lot of them are fda-regulated and prescription medications that are highly addictive. When I was introduced to Kratom I was skeptical of this also. But I did a lot of research and decided I would give it a try at this point I was desperate for something to help me without being addictive. Kratom has changed my life and so many other people's life that I know. Taking this away from us will only create more people addicted to prescription medicines and in that zombie-like state that we are all trying to avoid. We just want to live healthy Wonderful Life and Kratom has given us the opportunity. Thank you for listening. Please reconsider.

The benefits for me have been amazing, my pain is controlled, I've gotten off of prescription opiates which had literally torn my life apart for years and just made the emotional pain worse. This plant has helped many in the same ways as it has for me through anxiety, depression, emotional well-being, drive, I've actually gotten a better paying job working with animals. I have never had a bad reaction to this plant through numerous vendors, never! It has only helped in every instance. I understand drugs are a problem, but only in the instance of \"imminent public danger\" I.e. Flaka, spice, fentanyl pressed fake pills that are actually killing people. I do not believe anyone should mandate controlling a plant that has a better track record than peanut butter for killing people, it's not psychoactive, you don't get high, it doesn't inhibit motor functions for me.. Just a useful tool for living through some of life's downsides when it comes to the human body and pain..

We live in a society so addicted and controlled by expensive mass produced pharmaceutical chemicals, that have in fact been proven to be more detrimental to one's health than Mitragyna speciosa and cannabis could ever be, so why not allow a patient access to a natural remedy to supplement for their chronic pain. Their only legal alternatives are prescription painkillers that are for more addictive, in which once a tolerance and dependencies are formed, withdrawls are almost insurmountable, and are also far more expensive. Mind you this is their only legal alternative. \n\nMy mother suffers from chronic pain in her right leg and has had multiple surgeries, she'll never admit it but she is addicted to perfectly legal Oxycodon, an opiate, like heroin, and currently mt single mother is struggling with the conflict of paying this month's rent or refilling her costly prescription. I either have a roof over my head or have a doped out mother for the next month- and that's the best case scenario if shes able to afford both. On the month's where she can only afford one option she luckily puts her 2 sons over her addiction however i cannot have a conversation with her without my mother being entirely irritable. Her withdrawls made her life Hell and I'll i could do was watch, until one day i offered her Kratom. My mother ignorantly refuses to indulge in marijuana because here in Nevada it is currently no yet legal, however Mitragyna speciosa is. Now my mother is slowly beginning to regain her life back as she weens off of manufactured prescriptions and uses natural Kratom brews instead. \n\nThis \"drug\" has saved my household and as far as I'm concerned it has saved me a roof over my head. Of this herb goes further in the direction toward making it on the lists of controlled substances, my mother will fall back in the hands of addiction and next time she might not choose to pay rent over her addiction.\n\n To whomever may take the time to read this, know that I am very appreciative that you read this far, and to our regulators and legislators, please consider my plight when you're questioning whether this life saving natural plant should be legal or not. As of now it is legal and as long as it is legal it will continue to save lives just as it did my mother's. If this herb is outlawed, crime will only increase and the prescription chemicals that are legal will only continue to do more harm than good to ones health. Due to the chemicals a doctor told my mom to take her liver has only deteriorated with every pill that is injested and she is fully aware however that is not a problem when you're dependent on a drug a doctor certified for her to live.\n\nThank you for your time!\n-Salvador J.

The article described the medicinal uses of the leaves from the Kratom plant (Mitragyna speciosa Korth) in traditional Asian medicine. I have osteoporosis and have been prescribed various opioid medications over the past 20 years to ameliorate the chronic back pain I suffer from.  I purchased a small amount of Kratom from an online vendor and ingested it in the form of a tea. Later on I prepared gelatin capsules containing a measured dosage of the Kratom. My experience with Kratom is very much a positive one. I have found that ingesting 5 gelatin capsules of Kratom (equal to approximately 4.5/5.0 grams) when needed for pain management works as well as a 7.5 mg Vicodin or two 100 mg Tramadol tablets. I have found that using Kratom for pain management is a superior option to taking my physician prescribed opioid medications. I find I do not experience the \"fuzzines\" or mental lethargy that I get when I take opioid medications. The Kratom does not appear to compromise my mental acuity when I am at work, and I don't experience the \"euphoric\" side effects that  used to distract me and compromise my powers of concentration. I like the fact Kratom does not \"get me high\" and I like very much that Kratom successfully addresses my pain issues and has minimal side effects. In my experience, the Kratom \" high\" can be compared to the sensations I get from a cup of good strong coffee.  In my opinion, Kratom is a benign medicine that has few health risks and many benefits.  I can realistically foresee many medical applications in the future for Kratom as a viable alternative to the widespread use and abuse of opiate medications. Since I have been using Kratom to deal with my chronic pain, I have not used  opiate medications nor requested them from my Doctor.  I sincerely believe that the banning of Kratom will create many more problems that it will solve. The people who use Kratom as a safe alternative to opiates will be forced to revert to opiate medications and all the problems of tolerance and addiction that accompany it. I believe that for the majority of people who require medication to treat their chronic pain, Kratom is a better and safer alternative than the traditionally prescribed opiates. Please do not assign Kratom the status of a Schedule One narcotic... this is a useful and safe substance.  Thank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22622","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathan Levi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should not classify kratom as schedule 1.

I work as a manager and head of maintenance. I have a degree in engineering from Penn State Behrend. For the record, I am fully against scheduling of Kratom by the DEA. I have been using Kratom for two years now. I use it after a physically-demanding day at work to help me relax. I also have chronic depression and social anxiety, which I've had since early highschool. I have found a personal correlation between the time I was in a terrible car accident in 2006 which caused a tooth to die and also the herniation of my third lumbar in my spine. I have been forced to use everything ranging from opioids, muscle relaxers, and pain creams to counteract the severe physical problems and discomfort associated with the accident. I stopped using pain pills due to nausea and disorientation, which made it extremely difficult for me to do my job. I began researching alternatives to SSRI's and pain medications and concluded that Kratom was the safest to test run. I have since been alleviated of my social anxiety to a point that I am not confined to my home after work and able to work and interact more easily/comfortably with my co-workers. Furthermore, I have been able to move more easily and have a more comfortable range of motion since beginning my use of Kratom. I have not noticed any nausea as a result of this use, either. It is the most beneficial substance I have come to use as a result of my car accident. If you are truly representatives of the people, you will reflect our views and wishes to keep Kratom unscheduled. This is what the people commenting her want.

Kratom has saved many,many lives and should not be banned or scheduled. It allows people who suffer from chronic pain to live productive lives without having to take deadly,addictive narcotics. In our society it is undisputable that we have a huge problem with opiate addiction and death resulting from overdose. Kratom is non addictive and no one has ever died from Kratom use alone. It makes sense to allow citizens to have a SAFE alternative to treat their pain. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression. Kratom is impossible to overdose on. Its a natural leaf related to the coffee plant. A ban on this plant would be detrimental to our society. Pain patients would be forced into addiction from opiates or sentenced to a life of suffering. Many good ,law abiding, tax paying citizens who just want to live a normal life would be labeled as criminals. We already have over crowding in our jails around the nation and to add to that list of criminals, your average working mother or your sweet lil grandma just doesn't make sense. That's the face of Kratom, normal good people who don't  want to take drugs and choose a natural plant to manage their pain. Kratom has many valuable qualities but this one stands out . Please consider all the lives that would be destroyed if they are now not able to take their natural plant. Millions..Kratom is not taken to get high, it doesn't make you intoxicated. Kratom helps two types of people which make up a vast majority of our population: Those that DO NOT take drugs and rely on natural unadulterated medicine and those seeking a drug free life that have been dangerously addicted. Kratom works better than \"sub's\" to help addicts get clean because it is not addicting and relieves withdrawal symptoms leaving those people drug free and not addicted to anything at the end of their treatment. Instead of banning Kratom the medical community should be embracing it because of all the great benefits with NO dangerous side effects..

She tried to get me to try it for months but I didn't think it would help so I didn't want to try it.  I did not want to take medication for the rest of my life so decided to give it a try about six months ago.   I couldn't believe how well it worked to help with the pain.  It didn't make it go away, but helped enough for me to function normally.  I have not taken pain medication since!  \n\nWith the opioid epidemic in this country, the research on this amazing natural plant should continue.  There is no reason to rush and make this a Schedule I drug.  This natural plant is related to the coffee plant.  Please do not take this plant away from those of us that it helps.  Please focus on true threats to safety, heroin and opioids!  Even Tylenol and other OTC medications are dangerous and have taken lives.  The use of this dried up leaf is not causing harm to the American people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1423","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Nicole Gugger","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep kratom on the market it has helped  a dear friend of mine clean up from heroine!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17495","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Travis Beverlin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have 2 ruptured disks in my back. I get debilitating migraines as a result  in addition to the back pain. For the last 10 years I have been being prescribed various pain pills (narcotics) which make it nearly impossible to work, drive, etc. The narcotic pain pills ( tramadol, Percocet, oxycodone) make me nauseous and dizzy and grumpy. 4 years ago I got my medical marijuana card in hopes that I could stop taking the pain pills and still be pain free. Problem is, I can't consume marijuana during the day and maintain a normal productive life. I can only use it at night to sleep. 2 years ago, a coworker introduced me to Kratom. I was skeptical at first and spent many hours online doing research into this supplement. I went to a head shop in Denver and purchased a small amount to try it. I waited until the end of the day just in case it had unwanted side effects and took 4 capsules. Amazingly within 30 minutes, all of my pain was gone and I didn't feel out of my mind like with pain pills. I was fully functional and able to complete all normal tasks. I have used Kratom for 2 years on a daily basis now. I take 5 capsules with my coffee every morning and another 5 in the early afternoon. I no longer have pain during the day and I haven't taken one narcotc pain pill In over 2 years now. Kratom gives me energy, pain relief and allows me to be productive without any side effects. The only side effect I have ever experienced with Kratom is constipation when I first started taking it. It is also very low cost in comparison to the alternatives. I can buy ounces for 5 dollars from some bulk carriers in Colorado. I am a highly educated 40 year old mother of 5. I would never take something that I felt was unsafe. This is a miracle for so many people. I have heard  from hundreds of people in similar situations as mine who's lived have been saved since discovering Kratom. It has been used for hundreds of years in Asia. It can cure hangovers, migraines, bridge the gap for opiate abusers who are trying to quit using dangerous drugs. I beg of you to seriously research Kratom and its medicinal uses. Banning Kratom would literally send many of us back to the darkness of opiates.

Sometimes my pain is so bad that I have to have a hot bath several times a day just for temporary relief.  I go to bed with heating pads hoping to be able to get to sleep.  I'm only 62 years old.\n\nI have been given pain pills many times, but the relief is only temporary and I do not want an addiction problem.\n\nMy son, who had used Kratom for chronic pain, introduced me to its pain relief.  I couldn't believe how I could feel normal again.  I could use the kitchen step stool and climb the stairs one foot after the other.  I feel less depressed when I feel normal.  I use Kratom 3 - 4 times a week in the winter and very little in the summer.\n\nI have done quite a bit of research online and I'm aware of the dozen or so deaths attributed to Kratom.  I believe that further research into those deaths might show that some of the deaths were from a cocktail of drugs.  I haven't needed to up my dosage and I take 8 size 0 capsules when I do use Kratom.  \n\nOver 100,000 Americans signed a petition (including myself) to halt the DEA's two-year ban on kratom. During the temporary ban, the DEA would conduct studies on this natural supplement. To me, it makes more sense to conduct studies and then come to a conclusion on whether or not to ban kratom. \n\nPeople with pain matter. \n\nCompletely blocking access to kratom will have a direct impact on those who responsibly take pain medications to deal with a chronic medical issue. \n\nI urge the DEA to halt the ban until further studies can be performed. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who use opioids. We are responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. However, taking away a natural supplement that could replace an opioid as pain management doesn't make any sense.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKim Portera\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18031","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kim Portera","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nMy name is Joyce and I am a 58 yr old self employed jewelry designer.

I personally treat many patients with opiate use disorder. Several patients I have treated have augmented their opiate addiction with Kratom. 1 patient in particular was only addicted to Kratom. He is now successfully treated with Suboxone. According to the folks whom I treat, Kratom has an effect similar to opiates and possesses a reinforcing characteristic (like opiates). In Oregon the pendulum of opiate prescribing for chronic pain is shifting significantly and many folks are requiring treatment for opiate use disorder. This epidemic largely fueled by our own misguided and non-evidence based practice.  My sense is that Kratom would have similar efficacy as opiates for treatment of chronic pain, if that is what the claim is from advocates? We certainly now understand that chronic opiate pain medications for treatment of persistent pain are, under most circumstances, ineffective.

As a kratom user of two years I can honestly say kratom saved my life. I was addicted to heroin for what seemed like a lifetime. Opiate addiction drove me to do things I wish I could forget but, unfortunately those memories will haunt me for the rest of my life. After several years of sobriety I still think about heroin  everyday. It truly is that bad. I adamantly believe that if it weren't for kratom I would have used again, and as any recovering addict will tell you, it only takes one use to be right back in the middle of it again. My life has turned around completely in the last few years. Thanks to kratom, I am now self employed and prospering, more than at any point in my life. I implore that you read the testimonials from people like me, and seriously reconsider any intent to ban kratom. A ban on kratom would be detrimental to the life of so many good people that for once can feel normal. Thanks so much for your time.

After 3 months I'm the hospital I was released with 3 different drugs for the pain. I was told I would need this for the rest of my life or what's left of it after the damage... I couldn't work taking Morphine and Hydrocodne.  I was always tired and struggled to get up. I drank hundreds of energy drinks to try and compensate... One day while visiting California I was introduced to Kratom. It had an immediate impact on my life. I didn't need to sleep all the time or take pills every 4 to 6 hours. I was free. Now I don't have to take any drugs daily, I just have some tea in the morning and that's all!!! It's amazing how I can go days without taking Kratom and never feel sick like I did with hydromorphon and morphine. Saved my life and my relationships.

I am a recovering heroin and painkiller addict, who has now been sober of heroin and painkillers for a year now. I went to rehab, didn't work. My family and friends tried to force me to quit, didn't work, I just got better at hiding it. I eventually tried suboxone and methadone, the pharmaceutical drug that's meant to help you quit heroin, but that doesn't work at all, because it is also physically addictive. My last attempt was a natural grounded up plant called Kratom, and this successfully worked. To explain how lucky I am that this plant was available to me and successfully helped me quit opiates, it would be similar to if a methamphetamine addict quit by choosing to drink coffee every day instead. This is obviously a much safer, healthier, and natural alternative to heroin and painkillers. And if it's not going to be as easily available as it was, many people are going to die or continue to be unproductive members of society by staying on hard opiate drugs. Kratom is a real solution to the rapidly growing problem of heroin and opiate painkiller addictions, and if you allow the DEA to continue with this horribly irresponsible decision, it will only make things worse. Please, for the sake of the 2 million Americans currently struggling with opiate addiction, do everything in your power to stop this decision from being enacted.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9893","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Thompson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a paramedic with 25 years of emergency medical experience.  \n\nKratom, while not yet subject to extensive scrutiny by the western medical community, should not be placed on the list of scheduled substances at this time.  The reasons for this are as follows:\n1- There is extensive evidence (many thousands of testimonials) that kratom has provided a significant benefit to persons dealing with addiction to opiates.  \n\n2-There is little to no evidence that kratom use has resulted in adverse effects that are disproportionate with its potential utility to society.  While all medications can cause adverse effects, kratom has not shown that those effects are significantly increased such that a harm vs. benefit analysis would indicate there is a potential to create a serious danger to the public.  We recognize that aspirin and acetaminophen, when taken in excess, are extremely dangerous.  However the benefit we derive from widespread easy access to these medications far outweighs the risks.  There are no records in the literature of deaths due to the normal use of kratom; something that few medications can boast of.  What cases there are that involve death or morbidity are a result of complex interactions of numerous legal and illegal substances in a very small population of drug abusers.  Thus, kratom appears to be a relatively safe substance when ingested orally.  While there are several hundred cases of calls to poison control for kratom ingestion, it is worth pointing out that the recent publicity kratom has received due to DEA action has revealed that there are likely hundreds of thousands of kratom users in the US.  This is key to evaluating the risk of kratom: several hundred poison control calls resulting from ~50,000 regular users is of much greater concern than from 500,000 users.  The DEA and CDC must evaluate those calls based on the severity of the incident and in the context of the number of overall users.\n\n3-There may be a potential for addiction to kratom, but this is poorly understood and the currently available evidence, largely anecdotal in nature, indicates that kratom is less addictive than cigarettes.  Most users report that it does not result in severe withdrawal symptoms.  This is likely why kratom has enjoyed considerably success worldwide and throughout history as a treatment for opiate addiction.  Whereas cigarettes confer no benefit and are themselves a carcinogen, a rush to ban kratom due to possible addictive properties may result in greater social harm due to increased illicit drug use.\n\n4- Kratom holds out the possibility of better pain killing medications.  As an EMS provider, all of the currently available opiates and NSAIDs have significant drawbacks which must be carefully weighed for each patient.  However, if kratom is made a scheduled substance, research will be much harder.\n\n5- Many veterans who suffer from PTSD have reported significant improvement of symptoms.   Kratom appears to be an effective alternative to some anti-depressants and sleep medications.  This is another issue that deserves greater scrutiny by the medical community.\n\nKratom should be regulated.  There are issues of purity and a risk of adulteration from foreign suppliers.  Through the scientific community, studies may indeed show that kratom's risks outweigh its benefits and should be limited to a prescription only substance.  However, we are not there yet, and to arbitrarily ban kratom at this point is likely to cause greater harm than good.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3465","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Dawdy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I wanted to give my opinion regarding Kratom.

I read about Kratom, and long story short I have been off opiods for a year now. The Kratom DOES NOT PRODUCE A HIGH. It mereley removes the craving, and most of the withdrawals.

This is stimulant in the same family as comes that comes from a ground up plant material. I take a couple scoops in the morning when I go to work and it gives me energy, boosts my confidence and performance, and make mydaygenerally better, but most of all it helps me with the chronic back pain I have been facing every day for the past few years since I was in theMarineCorps and even before. So please listen to my story and do anything you can to help me. It is the best thing I have found to make my life easier and without itI could do more damage than good trying to find another thing to help me with my anxieties and issues because Its not a possibility thatI will find other ways, it is a probability.\n This drug has had no negative side affects for me other than tasting bad, but hey usually things that are good for you don't! I have been self medicating for a long time mainly because of my back pain and depression. I was in the Marine corps and willing to do anything for my country, but I was treated like trash and only told that I was going to hurt other people. Being young and nave I believed them, because that's what I was trained to do which caused me to have very low self esteem and started smoking a very dangerous substance called spice. This is a man made drug which is basically pot popari doused in chemicals to stimulate the brain much like marijuana. I was caught one day being unable to control my own body with four other Marine who were no slouches, they were all squad leaders and even the platoon leader. He was a good guy who got me to believe in myselfagain and have a purpose in life.Feeling like he would make a better impact on people than I could I took the fall o that he could stay in and do good things. I was then treated even more like a piece of human trash I started trying other things like boxes of cough medicine and bath salts. After I was discharged I was homeless for several months and even tried meth a few times before I realized I had to do something to change this or my life will truly become wasted.\n I got my act together and started going to college and getting my own job at McDonald's and again treated like I was workless even though I worked as hard as I could and be as nice as I could. So much so that every time I got home the only thing I could do was lay on the hard floor. I was able to find a very nice and beautiful Christian girl ad fall in love thinking my life is great. I was still using marijuana and cough medicine to ease my pain a little bit and her parents smelled the marijuana on me. Since then the have done everything in their power to wreck all communication between me and her which they were finally able to do after about a year of bullying us and treating me like I'm worthless. Since then I have found a new job at a very nice restaurant with great positive energy and somewhat similar stories. They introduced me to this drug called Kraton and being hesitant at firstI trusted every good thing he said about it and decided to give it a try. With instant results I was more energetic, happy, positive, more talkative, organized, and didn't have to bend over all the time trying to ease my back pain! Since then I have quit cigarettes, don't drink, I have my own apartment, and I am able to handle school and workalso training martial arts every week!\n Thank you for listening to my story and hopefully you can do something to help me because losing this would be a drastic thing to happen to me right now, being independent for the first time with no one to help me. The world hasn't given me to many opportunities and Kratom is the only thing keeping me going. Helping me to stay positive and have a better outlook on the future instead of having no motivation, or energy to get up out of bed, or clean my house or take care of my body. I feel the most healthy I have ever been and my back pain is no longer a day to day struggle! I want to do the best I can in the world and to help other because that is what gives me peace and happiness, but I cant do that if I have no energy and chronic pain. I have had no bad issues with this and doesn't even make me not want to eat like other stimulants I have tried in the past like coffee. I want to continue progressing with my life even if it is slow, I am taking it one step at a time and with your help I would like to believe I can continue to make small steps in the right direction!\nThank you,\n\nMitchell B.

My relationship with my parents was healed, I was able to make friends and enjoy my life. I could think happy thoughts, and get over the loss of my girlfriend. \n\nI was an unsuccessful musician when the accident happened.

I ask this of you bc I've experienced and seen the magic of this eastern medicine over our traditional western medicine. I and so many of my friends and family were and are trapped in the vicious cycle of opiate addiction and myself included we all have been stuck in the endless struggle with the no good methadone and the never ending suboxone. The few friends and family that haven't died or gone to prison from this addiction have some worse with methadone and like myself have created a fulfilling life under suboxone maintenance but with a very low glass ceiling of being only one day without the medicine into a month long and very strong withdrawal prompting or addict brains to get well to be able to keep up with these lives we've created under suboxone and doctors don't know how to get us off it nor do they want to, they say it's better than relapse. However, certain friends and myself have kicked the suboxone habit with the help of Kratom. It is not an opiate or even an opiate partial antagonist but it acts on the endorphine receptors add to leave a 10 year suboxone user to feel no withdrawal when drinking kratom tea, using only ateaspoon full of kratom per cup, every 4-6 hours. When doing this for the month long half life of Suboxone and at the time mark and not taking any substance to feel normal but to just wake up feels amazing, it's like you've been in a walking coma for years with opiates and suboxone and finally you are back to being a conscious human being. Even after getting off suboxone, i and my friends all sometimes dink kratom tea bc like other teas it has an energy boat to it but a very natural one not like caffeine which i can't even drink due to my extreme anxiety. So not only has Kratom given me and my loved ones or lives back from medical addictions from big pharma through suboxone etc but it also works as a vitamin giving your body and mind the energy and focus naturally, I've never ever felt any kind of high from kratom, at most when i was really sick from withdrawals from suboxone and u drank my first kratom tea i felt a overall warmth and comfort. There is so much more we can use kratom for and so much it can help with, please think about the lives you could change by giving it even enough of a chance as medical Marijuana, which i don't smoke and endorse add a medical substance. I guess i somewhat endorse it as a recreational substance when controlled by the state as has been proven to have other benefits other than just medical, just like how i stayed that even with a clean body system free of any drugs that drinking kratom does have other benefits than just a better opiate addiction medicine, like martial energy and focus. I'm sorry if i was repetitive but i just wanted to stress how much I've seen kratom work and save lives with no side effects except with it being mostly fiber some bathroom issues,  but then again so does suboxone just in the opposite way. \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4227","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"nothing should be banned without further examination","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17775","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"robbins robbins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern,  \n \n I am  a average middle class American.

Like millions of Americans just like me the addictive nature of those narcotic pain medicines took hold of me and would take everything and anything I loved away, I can only imagine what my life would of been like had I been  given something like Kratom, something that comes natural from the earth , not mass produced in a lab , I'm confident in stating that my three suicide attempts would of never happened and I would never had committed 5 felonies all in pursuit of obtaining such an addictive substance. It's very simple and very common sense this plant has the potential to put an end to the prescription nightmare that now plagues our country, tears families apart and destroys everything. I discovered this miracle when the prescription anti depressants no longer were working for me and I was sick of poisoning my mind and body only to have an unending list of negative side affects.

I have personally experienced very minimal negative effects and my use has been an overwhelmingly positive experience.\n\nI have also seen first hand the benefits Kratom has with people suffering from opioid dependence.

Kratom has helped me be able to stay off dangerous and harmful prescription and street drugs including vicodin and heroin which I was previously hopelessly addicted to. I also have numerous injuries resulting from accidents that kratom helps to alleviate the pain from. I know several other people that use kratom in a similar fashion and we use this miracle herb responsibly and have found great success in staying clean with the help of kratom. It has been 10 years since I have used prescription opiates or heroin thanks to kratom. I truly believe that I would be dead or hopelessly addicted to opiates if I had not found kratom. As you know all too well, our country is in the midst of an opiate epidemic. Banning kratom could be detrimental to anyone addicted to opiates who wants to quit. Please do not deny people who are addicted to harmful drugs a chance to get off them by banning kratom. Alcohol and prescription drugs are the real danger to our society, not kratom. People who use kratom are not degenerates or criminals or wastes of life. Kratom users come from all walks of life as you undoubtedly found out during the public outcry after the temporary ban. Kratom has led me to be a productive member of society with a college education,steady job, a family, a new found sense of self respect and a desire to continue to better myself. I hope you think about the fact that addiction knows no boundaries. It could affect someone you know and love. And addicts don't always come from people seeking to get high, you can become addicted to dangerous prescription medication from taking medication as prescribed by a doctor and become addicted before you even realize it. Addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue. Please be part of the solution, not part of the problem. Kratom could very well save a friend or family member of yours from the grip of addiction.  Kratom may not be a cure all that works for everyone, but for those it works for, it is the only thing that has worked. Thank you for your time and I hope that you make the right decision when it is time to re evaluate the legal status of kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7258","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-25T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am an US Army Iraq war veteran.

Based on my experience with Kratom, it is definitely worth looking in to further. I have suffered with chronic back pain for 20 years resulting from an accident. I'm well educated, have a great job and a family and living in pain just isn't an option. The drugs made me feel slow and dosages increased. I wanted to look for another option and started looking at legal supplements. I tried several - vitamin B, vitamin C, powdered kale in large doses and then tried Kratom. It provides pain relief as well as a mood improvement similar to coffee. I've never felt like it got me high in any way, but then again, I've always taken low doses of 1-2 grams at a time as needed just for pain management. I've been taking Kratom for 4+ years now and have never needed to increase my doses. It has always worked and has enabled me to stop all forms of pain killers that I was prescribed. It enables me to live a full life and to be healthy. At least that's what I think. I would really welcome further medical study to make sure that it is safe and to have a supply of high quality, regulated supplement to use. I don't think that Kratom is dangerous in any way - I think it is highly effective at pain management and should be studied. I've seen videos of people who are very dependent on Kratom to maintain their quality of life and feel a deep sense of compassion for them. Please keep Kratom legal and study it for the greater good of humanity.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1304","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Charles Fiordalis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":1,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Christian Sharia Law Prohibition doesn't work, and we have the 18th Amendment to prove it.

I do not believe it should be a schedule 1 controlled substance.  I am a college professor, and I teach courses in criminology and deviant behavior in which I cover the use and abuse of both legal and illegal drugs and the causes and consequences of associated social problems.  Kratom is nothing like the drugs I discuss in my courses.  \n\nWhile I am a full and tenured professor, I also suffer from some debilitating illnesses, including arthritis and RLS.  These illnesses have significantly affected my ability to enjoy and participate in daily life.  Kratom helps, and it does so without the negative side effects of so many other medications.  It is my first hand experience with kratom that makes me question why it was ever considered for scheduling in the first place.  \n\nBased on my personal experience and in my professional opinion, kratom has none of the characteristics of drugs that are dangerous to society. Any intoxicating effect is extremely mild and probably on par with caffeine.  It is not reinforcing, and people taking kratom arent likely to give up things like food and shelter to get more of the substance.  While there seems to be some indication of physical addiction in users who take regular large doses over a long period of time, the withdrawal is very mild and probably no more severe than a caffeine withdrawal headache.  I have seen no accounts of users needing more and more of the drug to get the same effect.  \n\nA safe and natural substance that helps people manage and cope with very common illnesses should be legal and available, and I would be happy to further discuss this issue with anyone interested.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17607","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Reiter","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I truly believe that kratom is safe.

I have been taking Kratom, as a responsible adult, for almost 4 years, and I take the same daily dose now that I started with. At times, I find it beneficial to alter or mix strains for the best prevention or pain relieving outcome, but I have never had to increase frequency or quantity of dosage.

After a long time in different types of treatments and mmt programs i discovered kratom. I started trying it because why not I had tried everything else. I found that talking about 5-7 granms two times a day. Once in the morning and once mid afternoon mid evening. Helped eliviate the pain from my surgery's quite a bit. Enough that i could stop taking the opioid pain relieving medications. At bed time I would smoke a joint for a good night's sleep it helped with my PTSD and nightmares.

There is no reason to ban it as a schedule 1. Now  what should be regulated is how some growers and/or companies alter it. Now standard powder is completely harmless and has alot of benefits. I've created a great product with amino acids that work wonders on detoxing opiate addicts and people with chronic pain. The problems that I see are in the enhanced Kratom extracts  and resins. The extracts have a 15x potency. And of course there are companies that make \"get high\" products using it.But the majority of people that I see use standard powder which relieves pain while helping with anxiety and mood. Now another issue is that since it is not FFS approved it does not come with instructions for usage. I.E. people can take too much which leads to headache and maybe nausea. I don't want it to be banned because the benefits outweigh the consequences. It can revolutionize the opiate epidemic because you shouldn't have to take an opiate to get off one. I personally got off opiate pain medicine with Kratom and helped many others do the same. It's in the same family as the coffee plant and withdrawal effects are similar to that of caffeine mild headache lay of energy,etc. I've researched Kratom for over 10 years. So please don't ban standard leaf and powder. If anything regulate the extracts. And allow for directions of usage. It would put an end to any problem with misuse.

A friend introduced me to kratom in a tea back in 2011, and I noticed its mildly relaxing effects. It was only after I had some dental surgery that was very painful for longer than I had prescription medication that I noticed how good it was for intense pain. \n\nKratom was actually better than the Vicodin the dentist prescribed, because it didn't make me feel as \"loopy\" as the prescription did. Now I usually only use it for pain, especially when pain would make it hard to fall asleep, just before going to bed, for my hip or my jaw (I have TMJ) when either of those flare up. Otherwise, I do not crave it or notice its absence, so have not personally found it to be addictive. The most I will take at once is about a 1/2 -3/4 teaspoon, because I know first hand (from one of my earlier experiences--but then, I'd consumed a beer shortly afterwards) that more can cause nausea. My understanding is that the nausea keeps one from abusing it, as it is purgative when too much is taken.\n\nWhen I am in pain, kratom really helps me to fall asleep quickly, and stay asleep for most of the night, which is a real blessing. The idea of kratom being listed as a Schedule 1 drug when I've found it to be a helpful medicinal herb is quite troubling, as I have several friends who have also benefited from taking it, for anxiety, energy (kratom is in the coffee family), as well as pain. \n\nOne concern with putting it on Schedule 1 is that all research for kratom's effects to wean people off of opiate addiction would come to an abrupt halt.  Another concern is that it would be effectively adding one more herb to the \"War on Drugs\" that may serve to incarcerate many people for non-violent than violent crimes, when the prison population of the US is higher in proportion to population than any other country in the world.\n\nI do not know what harm has prompted the DEA to consider taking kratom to Schedule 1 status, if the deaths that are supposedly laid at its account were caused by kratom alone or by a bad combination of things (potentially other drugs? lifestyle?), but my personal experience with kratom has been one of great benefit and not of harm, and hope that you will reconsider the criminalizing of an herb that has medicinal benefits.\n\nThank you for opening up to comments.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20001","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Paula Bishop","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"How silly to place kratom on a schedule of any kind.

I am 35 years old and have been sober from Alcohol for 5 years now.   I now have my CNHP degree because I realized the importance of taking care of my personal health as well as the health of my friends and neighbors.   I looked for alternative ways to combat my back pain from past car accidents and anxiety in social settings.   I went the prescription route when I was 30 and that did not help me at all.  Instead, just made my addictive personality worse.  I did not have a life at all on this.  I had to look for other ways.  Which lead me to find Kratom.  I use just 1  teaspoon in the morning and again 1 teaspoon again in the afternoon.   This is all I need.   I wouldn't call it misusing by any means.   Does it help me feel better,  yes!   Do I still go to work, yes!   And I am more of a productive citizen then ever before.  Kratom does not need to be made illegal.   It does need to be regulated, yes!

As this seems like a trend now instead of a right it is essential that people step up and demand to be heard. I am a 31 year old mother and I believe with all of my heart that kratom should be left alone. Keep it open and unregulated, as it is now because I've never witnessed the self-regulation of an industry quite like kratom. I've never seen stores or online vendors sell to underage people. Never is not to be taken lightly as I've seen this going on for almost ten years now. The media spectacle this has become is shameful because as with everything else, people must try to distinguish between propaganda and truth to find any facts in our fight for kratom. The fact that Big Pharma is large enough to affect the decision of a Government is beyond comprehension. \nKratom is not a danger. It is a miracle that should be embraced and appreciated. We are in the middle of a highly dramatic opioid crisis and any plant should be left alone to be utilized by people in their fight for a normal life. I have seen people re-claim their life because of kratom. I have seen parents of kids claim that kratom has killed their children the 1st time they used it and although I truly sympathize with any parent who has lost a child I know that kratom doesn't kill. It heals. The fear mongering that the mainstream media is feeding the masses about kratom is shameful and in-correct. \nAs highly educated adults we all know that this plant is less harmful than anything you buy in a pack of 20, a 6 pack, or in a pill bottle. Naturally, this should mean that the harmless plant should be left alone and the chemicals sold by massive corporations should be outlawed. Since we live in an alternate universe where common sense doesn't rule anymore we are left defending the things that shouldn't need to be defended.\nLet adults make their own choices. Leave Mother Nature's miracle plants alone and please for the love of everything Holy let kratom be legal. There should be no question to this. It should be blatantly obvious.

I started having health problems-mainly neurological-back in October of 2008.   Over the next bunch of years, I met with over 40 doctors before finally getting diagnosed with Lyme disease.  I was misdiagnosed for 5 years.  About a year into treatment, the symptoms became so bad that I had to stop working.  I missed 18 months of work where I essentially stayed in bed all day.  I missed most of my kids sports games and essentially made my wife a \"single mom\".  You wouldn't believe how bad Lyme disease can be.   I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.   As I went through my treatment, I developed other symptoms, including excruciating nerve pain from my waist down. The pain was unbearable.  My doctors, trying to help out, put me on a combination of three drugs : tramadol, Trileptal and Neurontin.   On a scale of 1 to 10, my pain every morning was a seven.   When taking these drugs, my pain dropped to a four or a five. It didn't relieve the pain, but it made it bearable to get through the day. I was taking about 250 pills a week.  The side effects were terrible.  During this time, I was doing a lot of research on the Internet. Somehow, by the grace of God, I came across the page that discussed Kratom.   After hearing about its benefits to those of us with pain,  I purchased a small now to see if it would help. The conclusion was unbelievable-not only  did taking a teaspoon in my drink help, it actually took my pain completely away-for a couple of hours anyway.  Candidly, I'm not sure I believed it. So the next day, first thing in the morning, I tried it again. On a scale of one through 10,  my pain went all the way down to a two! You wouldn't believe the difference this can make in your life. I missed 18 months of work, and this is what allowed me to get back to work.   I wouldn't of been able to go back if it were not for Kratom.   I've been back to work for just over two years now. I'm engaged with my family and my children like never before. I coach my son's soccer team. I coach my daughter's basketball team now. I was at one point  where I literally wanted to die-the pain was so excruciating.  Kratom  has given me my life back. I take it daily and have never had any addiction problems.  I do not have any side effects. Please reconsider making this a schedule one drug. I've never had an illegal drug in my life,  and a ban on Kratom  would probably make me violate that principle.

It allows me to make it through the workday pain free. Kratom is a good pain reliever, anti-anxiety, and antidepressant, all without making the user feel drugged out like prescribed opiates or any other drug would, because kratom is NOT a drug. It is a dietary supplement that is no more harmful to take everyday than coffee is to drink everyday. I feel normal throughout the day after taking it, but without the pain that I would normally be feeling. It is cruel to take away this remedy from me or anyone else who depends on it to live a normal life, and all without even doing any real research to find out whether the plant has any medicinal qualities or not. I'm urging you to halt the ban on kratom so that we have a chance for the researchers to find out for themselves how beneficial this plant really is for a multitude of disorders. Pain management only scratches the surface of the the potential benefits that kratom possesses.\n\nRegardless of how the media has tried to spin things before, kratom is almost impossible to overdose on. I know there is this scare right now that kratom is something kids are going out and getting high on; something kids are being sent to the hospital for overdosing on. But the reality is that kratom has no potential for abuse. At higher doses, it causes nausea and dizziness, causing the user to vomit. So if a person tried to \"get high\" off of kratom, they would be in for a very unpleasant experience (not deadly or harmful, just unpleasant). Because of this property, it would be nearly impossible for someone to overdose on kratom. Kratom is normally taken by ingesting it and because the plant material would be vomited back up before it had a chance to digest and fully absorb into the user's system (assuming someone was able to get down the massive amount of plant material it would require in the first place yuck), an overdose would be extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve. Also, the reality of things has to be taken into consideration: if someone had taken some kratom and then later went out to party, say underage drinking, abusing prescription pills, taking drugs, any of the above, which of those things do you think they are going to tell the doctors about if they have to be taken to the hospital? They would most likely tell them about the one that isn't going to get them into trouble and that they probably don't care about getting banned: kratom. \n\nIn conclusion, kratom has no place in the list of schedule I drugs. It has many beneficial uses and should be treated as a dietary supplement, NOT as a drug. There are many people like myself who would much rather take kratom everyday than addictive, prescription medications. There WILL be ripple impacts beyond what we can reasonably foresee if this scheduling of kratom goes through. There will be more people switching over to addictive substances. I would even expect the number of opiate-related deaths to increase if such a thing were to pass. Please think this through thoroughly before proceeding.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions you may have and thank you for your time.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17673","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Williams","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have used kratom and marijuana, as well as other substances.

I have reviewed research where the social norm decriminalized addictive substances and proactively introduced those members back into society have proven beneficial for not only the singular individual but the entire community. I understand that net negative influences can be misleading and an individual who leads beyond that norm can be detrimental to us all but the investment of people should prove to be more beneficial than currency. I understand that the \"War on Drugs\" is a lucrative business but it's one that can never be won by repeating the same judgement over and over again expecting different results. That is the definition of insanity. And so is disallowing research to be conducted over an unknown substance. That's a stance where \"I'd rather be blind than know the truth.\" What kind of society do you envision denying truth to justify and fit your narrative? This is not a progressive stance nor a conservative one it is an opportunity to educate the masses and assist our society before addiction creates a debt that makes social security seem miniscule. I have read through this docket and surmise no sound reasoning for this substance to be banned. I only hope the judgment made by whomever this decision resides comes to the same conclusion.

But it was the beginning of my new unwanted life because I was addicted to the pain med since I no longer could get them for any reason.I found them on the streets,I had more energy and felt I was being a good mom and wife(getting so much done) I had to start taking more and more till 15 a day is what I had to have to have a day just to feel normal,I found more connections and spent money on pills before bills,we almost lost our house that we worked and saved for all our life.I couldn't tell my family,I was to ashamed of myself,I couldn't stop because I couldn't deal with the withdraws.I would cry my self to sleep every night and pray to God, but when I wake up I had no choice but to take pills.The couple connections wasn't enough anymore. I found a old friend that said she could help me get a new connection(more money) and it was in a bad neighborhood, I was spending all my time chasing pills. It was like clock work always looking at the calendar to see dates of when my next 80 pills where coming. One of my connections didn't come through one day and I was always in need by calendar days of my connections.I called  that one friend and she could get them,in the bad neighborhood, I sat there for 4 hrs.

I am opposed to the DEA making the alkaloids in Mitragyna speciosa (kratom) schedule I. \n\nA few years ago I sought treatment from my physician for chronic abdominal pain that had an unclear etiology. Due to the debilitating nature of this pain, I was initially prescribed Percocet (Oxycodone and Acetaminophen) to be taken a few times a day. My tolerance to this drug increased rapidly and over the course of a year and a half my physician increased my prescription to 40 mg of Oxycontin per day and roughly 40 mg of Percocet per day. I realized that I was becoming dependent on these drugs and became worried about the well-known side effects of the drugs (respiratory depression, narcotic bowel syndrome, etc.) and asked my physician to be weaned off of them completely. Even with a very gradual wean, coming off of oxycodone was incredibly difficult, and the withdrawals were one of the worst experiences of my life. In an attempt to help deal with the symptoms, I set out on the internet to search for an herbal supplement that could help with anxiety, and happened upon Kratom. I came across an enormous number of testimonials of people who used Kratom to help with the opioid withdrawals and were able to successfully stay off of the narcotics thanks to the Kratom. After researching the safety of the plant, and noting that there are no significant side effects and no deaths attributable to the plant (the only recorded deaths where the alkaloids were found in post-mortem toxicology results also involved heavy narcotics such as heroin or oxycodone) I decided to give it a shot. I have now been free of narcotics for well over 3 years with no relapses. I am 100% confident that had it not been for this plant, I would still be taking heavy narcotics for my pain relief. The kratom offers me relief from not only my chronic pain, but it helps me sleep well, reduces my anxiety and depression, and allows me to function much more normally than before. I also would like to note that I have noticed absolutely no dependence on Kratom. I take it when I am feeling significant pain not controlled by Acetaminophen or NSAIDs, and otherwise feel no compulsion to take take it more often than necessary. It provides me no \"high;\" only a reduction in pain.\n\nI like to compare kratom to valerian root, another herbal supplement that people use for insomnia and anxiety. It is no more dangerous than valerian root which can be bought at just about any drug store or even at department stores. It has been used safely for thousands of years in other parts of the world. There is no reason that kratom needs to be scheduled as a schedule I drug. Before I was an MT, I was a certified pharmacy technician and am very familiar with the scheduling system. Schedule I needs to be reserved for actual drugs of abuse that can cause significant danger to human health. Kratom needs to be classified as an herbal supplement and regulated as such since it has no notable safety concerns and a very small side-effect profile. If it weren't for kratom, I can assure you that the DEA would be dealing with thousands more cases of people seeking out illegal opioid narcotics or abusing the healthcare system for narcotics.\n\nI am confident that should the DEA decide not to schedule Kratom in the same category as heroin and methamphetamine, allowing for studies to be performed, the anecdotal evidence of Kratom's efficacy and safety profile will be made obvious and Kratom will be found on the herbal supplement shelves of drug stores everywhere thanks to its many uses. \n\nThank you for allowing the people to speak on this issue and not taking drastic measures. The fact that you have asked for this commentary shows that the DEA can make reasonable decisions and acts based on the desires of the people while considering public safety. Please weigh these out appropriately when making your final decision. The public is not in danger from the very mild effects of Kratom and its alkaloids. The public is very much in danger from the addictive and dangerous effects of both legal and illegal opioids and focus should be placed on the overprescribing of opiates and reducing available illegal opioids while placing emphasis on recovery rather than incarceration for those afflicted with addiction. Thank you again.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1881","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to protest the addiction of kratom as a schedule 1 narcotic.

It has also given me back to my family. I suffered from an extreme case of epyditimytus 8 years ago. It was so bad that I had one of my testicles removed because of nerve damage it causes me severe chronic pain. Over the course of 8 years I have prescriptions for fentanyl patches, 80 mg OxyContin, Percocet, Vicodin, and even had a pain pump implanted until it caused life threatening problems and had to be removed. During all the years I developed a severe addiction to opioids, I tried several times to get clean and was beginning to feel hopeless and on the verge of losing my family. I have 4 young children and an amazing wife. It wasn't until November of 2015 that I found kratom. After only the first dose my cravings dissipated and even better, my pain was immediately relieved. It decimated my pain. I have since gotten a job that I love. I'm not your stereotypical drug addict. I'm a true cowboy and farmer. I have my own cattle and I work as a farm hand daily. I wear boots and jeans and listen to country music. I wasn't able to ride horses or do what I love for years and thanks to that ground up leaf I can do everything I used to be able to do. I wasn't even close to being who I was before opioids. On opioids the pain control was minimal and I was constantly trying to take more and constantly was trying to obtain more and more. I have taken Kratom for a year now as a semi heavy user. I have never had any worse side effects than constipation or upset stomach. It's as euphoric as a cup of espresso and takes my pain almost completely away. If this is taken from us then I will go back to pills. And if that's not an option then herion could be on the table as an option. It's also worth noting that I am a veteran of the us navy and served my country with honor, courage, and commitment. My point is this. I'm not your stereotypical looking junkie, I work hard for this country, my family and especially for my god, to be a good citizen. And kratom helps me do that. I beg of you, do the right and honorable thing and let kratom stay available to us. Please.  Also compare the statistics of alcohol, marijuana  , or even laundry packs to kratom and see for yourself in black and white and see which is more deadly or even more harmful","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17014","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Jacobs","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam,\nI am 74 years old and have severe restless leg syndrome and arthritis.The side effects of the rls medication are terrible - I am loosing my balance for one thing.

In the USA it has a developed a small niche market. This market is almost solely created by personal advocates and has no criminal connection whatsoever. The effects of criminalizing it will not only marginalize this minority but force them to switch to a similar drug that will be easier to transport, synthesize, and obtain. Kratom displaying some opiate effects, will force many of the users left behind to switch to the much easier to obtain, Heroin or Oxycodone to subside the established craving. Compared with Heroin and Oxycodone, Kratom has never caused a death in the USA when taken alone. There have been much less complaints about health effects of Kratom than Caffeine as registered by the National Poison Data System. It's abuse potential is low, and it is almost always used by users experiencing pain or weening off of other more addictive and deadly opiates. A ban would also prevent the research of the much more safe and effective anesthetic that 7-Hydroxymitragynine is when compared to conventional anesthetic like morphine. \n\nI understand the intent is benevolent, but the effect is malicious.

I am submitting another comment because a very important article has come to my attention.  This article is written by Dr. Walter Prozialeck and was published this month in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.  In this article, Dr. Prozialeck states that kratom should not be classified as an opioid and has good potential for benefit which would be endangered by criminalizing kratom.  He states that kratom does not generally produce an intense high or euphoria and, very importantly, does not produce respiratory depression.  (This lack of respiratory depression was mentioned in my first comment, but I wanted to reiterate it, as yet another doctor has made this statement.  He further states that his literature review indicates to him that kratom has been consumed leading to positive results such as a reduction in pain, anxiety, depression and helping mitigate the effects of opioid withdrawal.  Given this additional evidence, this appears to strengthen the argument against banning kratom.  I continue to remain of the strong opinion that kratom should not be criminalized.  \n\nThe full article can be viewed here: http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2588524\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11083","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Katherine Lair","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have numerous friends that have been helped by kratom.

I serve as the Secretary for the Institute of Food Technologists, Longhorn Chapter, and am the Director of Yeast Leavened R&D and SQF Practitioner at Bridgford Food Processing of Texas LP. I am an Eagle Scout, and recently a volunteer for the International Rescue Committee. I am also a responsible kratom user.\n\nIn high school, I weighed over 240 lbs and led a relatively sedentary, depressed life. My depression led to my lifestyle which fed my depression cyclically. This changed in college when I began running regularly, dropped to 185 lbs, and garnered the emotional willpower to lead a more outgoing life. That's all well and good for a 19 year old, but I am 29 now. 10 years of running 4-7 miles, 4-5 times a week, while enabling me to live an objectively better life, has fostered chronic muscle pain I feel all day, every day. Some days the pain is so stubborn I can't run more than a mile and a half. When this happens I fall back into the depressive state that plagued my younger years, and it is absolutely terrifying. The thought that I could descend back into that place because I'm physically incapable of maintaining a healthy habit, that it could alter the direction of my career and personal life for the worst, that is unacceptable.\n\nI went to 2 doctors who recommended several things, opioids, muscle relaxers, and even self-medication with Texas's prison-quota-filler a la creme, marijuana. Depressing, yes? That according to doctors, my options consisted of poison that is killing Americans in unprecedented numbers and living outside the boundaries of lawful citizenry. (see:Eagle Scout)\n\nWhen kratom entered the public eye after the FDA's initial letter, I became curious instantly. Its advocates described an effective painkiller that, juxtaposed with comparable prescription products, is relatively side effect free, a reliable mood stabilizer, and inexpensive. Opponents to its legalization dubbed the drug, \"herbal heroin,\" a blight on our society with no medical use whatsoever, much like opium (morphine) and marijuana (CBD oil). The advocates' arguments were far less logically and morally problematic, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nI took my first dose, 4 grams orally, 3 months ago. Not only was the constant ache of my active lifestyle subdued, but my mood and productivity at work were elevated and remarkably stable. I haven't missed a single running date since, and have started running a 13 miles, a half marathon, every 2 weeks. So the advocates are correct; responsible kratom use has the potential to improve people's lives.\n\nBut could kratom alone be dangerous? The \"alone\" qualifier is important, because you need to apply the same logical and moral standards across the board. E.g., Alcohol and Tylenol are two very legal substances, and should remain so. However combined, they are deadly, sending approximately 60k Americans to the emergency room and killing hundreds every year. As it is not ok to determine the legal status of alcohol based upon its interaction with Tylenol, prohibiting kratom use because people are unwise enough to take it with other substances is silly. I took it upon myself to determine the physical and emotional side effects of kratom \"abuse\" and withdrawal, understanding that no two people are physiologically the same, ergo mine and all reactions are unique. I increased my dose to 6 grams, 8, then 14 to see if the uncharacteristic increase in dosage would catch my body off guard. I maintained my 14 gram a day regimen for a week, and while I noticed more perspiration and  pronounced feelings of calm and relaxation, according to my coworkers and friends, it did not alter my behavior in any significant way. I ran typically fast, and felt typically satisfied with life.\n\nThe end of my experiment was happily uneventful. I quit cold turkey, and expected to experience severe emotional distress and physical pains, like when I quit smoking cigarettes. Neither came. I continued running, more capable because of my 2 months of increased physical activity. Even though I ran slower, I had no trouble finishing 4, 8, or 13 miles without walking. I felt mild ennui at the office, but was able to focus and solve complex problems without the sheer grief and anxiety that accompanied nicotine withdrawal. With respect to my own body, given my experience should be subject to the same side effects detractors cling to when they laud kratom, \"herbal heroin,\" it is my opinion as a scientist that their statements regarding the harmful effects of kratom are categorically false.\n\nA government has the right to restrict access to substances that in normal use infringe upon the rights of its society. Cocaine, a highly addictive and life destroying drug, should clearly be illegal. What is not clear is why anyone would ban a substance with such potential to improve peoples lives without consequence. On the contrary, that the FDA would do so without firmer scientific grounds is extremely troubling.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12566","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joseph deAlcuaz II","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I broke my back, clavicle and four ribs in a car accident two years ago.

Ahy pain medication is superfluous.  It's addictive and it only masks the pain - you can still feel the pain, it's just underneath.  As my occupation relies on feeling well - I do my best with self massage, stretching, epsom salt etc., but I work long hours.  At this time, I also had to move from one state to another because of my ex taking a new job.  Having 50% custody of my daughter meant I had to go.  Depression and anxiety reared it's ugly head and some of the antidepressants were horrible - some I tried cause more damage than good, and one in particular led to 6 months of hell trying to get off of it.\n\nSo 4 years or so ago I was searching online and in health stores to find a solution.  I cam across Kratom for pain, and thought I would try it, altho I didn't really think it would help.

I am a 49 year old male executive manager for an Auto Dealer Group in Texas. I am contacting you to express my view regarding the DEA ban of Kratom.\n\nAbout a year ago I had a near  fatal motorcycle accident and during my recovery was prescribed very strong pain medicine. After a short time, I grew dependent upon the medication to deal with chronic pain.  Although the medication did relieve my pain, it also caused me to be sleepy and I was unable to maintain my cognitive abilities. I had lost my ability to make good business decisions and was always looking forward to my next dose of medication.  Many of my coworkers noticed that I began to care more about my medication than my dealership's business.\n\nI was introduced to Kratom as an alternative to strong opioid medication by a coworker. He is a war vet. An Army Officer who served our great country in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was severely injured during his last tour and was unable to continue his service. He too was prescribed strong medication to deal with his injuries. After coming to the same conclusions that I did, he discovered Kratom as a viable alternative.\n\nFor me and MANY others who do not want to rely on strong pain medication, Kratom is a very good alternative. I use the word alternative very a loose term. It is the only thing that I use for pain relief. I have experienced ZERO negative side effects. In fact, Kratom has provided me with many benefits. Some of those are increased and natural feeling energy, mood boosting and reduced anxiety. I deal with stress in a much healthier way and have a strong desire to help others. None of which I experienced while under the stronghold of pain medication.\n\nI urge you to stop the proposed plan to ban Kratom. It has helped me and many more people. Further research should be done. While I am not a medical professional, it is my opinion that Kratom is far safer than strong pain medications. If the ban of Kratom passes, many law abiding people will find no other way except for the black market to find this amazing alternative. \n\nI am not a criminal and do want to make that choice.\n\n\nThank you for allowing me to express my views. I am certain I am not alone in this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18685","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ron Moretz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please keep in mind schedule one is intended for medicines/chemicals with zero positive uses, or even those who's cons outweigh pros.

I agree some regulation to ensure children are not being marketed Kratom as some kind of legal party drug would be a good idea. Keep it out of head shops and mini markets but allow the retailers who supply the vast majority of Kratom users (99% are online) to continue operating. Onerous regulations will force many legitimate resellers to shut down as most are small scale businesses. I live in California where Marijuana has just been legalized - I don't agree with that decision and I feel the risk of using pot is far greater than using Kratom. There may be enhanced or extracted Kratom-based products that are more potent but I don't think these are commonly available (at least not from the sellers I know).

Mitragyna speciosa grows naturally in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea and has been used for many years in Southeast Asia as an opium substitute. In recent years there has been an increase in use of kratom in the United States ...\n\nClearly, formal studies, both pharmaceutical and clinical, are needed to determine appropriate dosage, use, and action.\n\nWell-designed RTCs would be helpful.\n\nAs with all medicinal agents, interaction with other phamaceuticals/agents can be problematic, and may be part of the unfortunate instances with this botanical.\n\nAnother factor can be placebo effect, and the intention of the person taking this botanical deserves attention.  While I have spoken with people who claimed to have had psychological experiences, that was not my experience at all.\n\nWhile anecdotal, the experience of a trained medical observer may offer some information.\n\nMy first ingestion of this botanical was as a tea, at a local coffee shop.\nI do not know the exact amount the proprietor mixed in the tea, but I did have a completely empty stomach ... and developed transient nausea.\n\nThe following week, I had the tea (1/2-1 teaspoon in a cup of juice/mint tea) after a meal, and did not experience nausea.\nI used this botanical for moderate musculoskeletal pain, much as one would use OTC NSAIDs, and I found the effect very similar to OTC naproxen sodium.\nUsing the 1 teaspoon dose in a cup of mint tea/juice, twice a day for 10 days.\n\nI discontinued abruptly, and had no negative sx. Since that time, I have used the 1 teaspoon dose in a cup of mint tea/juice between meals, intermittently, as I would use OTC naproxen sodium.\n\nMy experience with NSAIDs is that after a few days of use, my clotting factors seem to be affected, and I did not have this experience with the botanical kratom.\n\n\nMy view, is that it is similar to OTC naproxen sodium in analgesic effect; I did not experience any significant side-effects; I did not use it with any other medications or agents.\n\nThank you for your serious consideration of this plant's beneficial history in widespread use.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMK Austin, PA, MPH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22982","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"self-employed","postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"MK Austin, PA, MPH","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me so much.  I was in a car accident 12 years ago and it tore a disk. Two years later after much suffering even while taking narcotic pain medication, I had a spinal fusion.  This basically resulted in me trading one type of debilitating pain for another.  I have no choice but to take a narcotic pain medication to live any kind of live. During this time of my life, I was a mom of two young children and an elementary level school teacher.  In order to make a living and in order to take care of my children, I had to continue taking the pain medication.  But my life was still very limited, but I still functioned. As I have gotten older, the pain meds have become less and less effective.  Now, please let me point out that I didn't have a full life. My life revolved around around my chronic pain.  I could only do things by taking medicine and allowing it to kick in and then do what I needed to do.  As my medication became less effective I was looking for other options and found kratom.  I now can do anything I need to do at just about any time of the day. I don't even take the narcotic medicines unless I am having a very bad pain day.  And all of this from an herbal product. I am telling you that taking Kratom is like taking aspirin and drinking a cup of coffee.  There is no high with this.  Unfortunately I think because people who have abused heroin take this,with much success, to get off of it, people seem to think it's a drug people are abusing.  You don't get high, and from what I understand, if you take too much, you will vomit. PI would also like to point out that alcohol causes many deaths and destroys maby lives, all while being a legal product that is only for getting intoxicated.  If you make Kratom a class 1 substance, many people who are now functioning members of society because of Kratom  will become people who can't work, can't parent their children, and some will even return to the illegal drugs they abused. As a child of a heroin addict whose mother died young from heroin addiction, I would do anything to help others avoid the life I lived because of this terrible drug.\nSincerely, \nBridget L Hall","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1088","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bridget Hall","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not a drug.

I strongly oppose the DEAs proposal to make the alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, two constituents of the kratom plant, schedule 1 controlled substances. This would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. Kratom is a regulated dietary ingredient. Kratom is not a drug and is not addictive.\n\nOver the past several years I have undergone multiple back surgeries as a result of severe herniated disks and have lived with chronic, debilitating pain for years.\n\nI found Kratom five years ago after researching natural alternatives to prescription drugs. Kratom has helped me personally to cope with my chronic back pain, so that I can run a business and be an active/engaged father of two young children.\n\nI feel it is very important to remember that Kratom is a natural plant that is closely related to the coffee family and does not belong as a schedule one drug.\n\nThere are thousands upon thousands of Americans, many of whom are veterans, professionals, business owners and active contributors to society, that have found Kratom as a healthy alternative to dangerous opiate drugs.

Mr. Stivers has done a lot of work to control opiate abuse in Ohio, and I would like to make the case that banning kratom would cause us to lose ground in those efforts.\n\nHello Mr. Stivers,\n\nI work as a school teacher, and I care deeply about the well-being of our young people. Recently, the DEA announced its intention to move the kratom plant to the list of Schedule I substances. I would like to ask you to help stop this from happening.\n\nI have been reading about your recent efforts to combat the opioid addiction epidemic, and I'm really happy to see that you care about the diverse group of people who fall victim to this terrible affliction. Preventing unused prescription opioids from getting onto the streets is a commonsense plan, and I hope it becomes law. I believe if kratom gets banned, the opioid epidemic will get even worse. Let me explain why.\n\nMy mother was dependent on oxycodone to manage her pain from carcinoid cancer, and after she passed away, my little sister abused and become addicted to her hundreds of leftover pills. The kratom plant saved my sister's life. After trying and failing to get off the prescription pills in a variety of ways, she found kratom, and used it to ease herself off of the prescription meds. I've since learned that there are many like her who've used the plant in a similar way.\n\nKratom is a plant native to East Asia and have been used by the people there as a traditional medicine for over 1000 years. It is a relative to the coffee tree, and has analgesic and some mild opioid-like effects. Taken in small doses, it takes away the urge to use opiates, and for many, acts similar to an anti-depressant, with a mild, mood-lifting effect. Taken in larger doses, it mimics opiates in some ways, but it's much milder, and with fewer side effects. There is also no chance of overdosing (people will vomit if too much is taken).\n \nKratom is a 100% organic leaf that is dried and ground into a powder, but some are adulterating it, or making super-concentrated versions of it and putting it into head shops, marketing it as a drug of abuse, similar to synthetic marijuana. This is a big part of the reason why it is getting attention and a bad reputation among lawmakers.\nAs kratom is getting more popular, people are discovering that it is very effective in helping overcome opioid addiction. It can ease withdrawal symptoms and also act as a maintenance medication, much safer than something like suboxone or methadone.\n\nI believe if this plant is made illegal, its users will turn back to opiates. As you know, that's a dangerous game, as fentanyl-laced heroin and the like is killing off addicts in Ohio by the dozen. Many opiate addicts don't even know kratom exists, and I think we should be using it help people instead of lumping it in with synthetic drugs that are part of the problem.\nPlease look into this and help fight the opioid addiction problem by keeping kratom legal! \n\nThank you\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3092","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not proceed with banning this herb !

Well, never, until the DEA decided to make it a problem. Just like Harry Anslinger did before them, DEA bureaucrats are demonizing a substance to justify their own existence. The DEA couldn't care less about whether a given drug is truly a threat to public health or not. According to the DEA, there have been 15 deaths attributed to kratom between 2014 and 2016. Fifteen, in two years. Is that a public health threat? What the DEA fails to point out is that those fifteen deaths stemmed from the use of other drugs in combination with kratom (per three published studies, one in \"Journal of Forensic Sciences\" and two in \"Journal of Analytical Toxicology\"). \nFifteen deaths in two years, allegedly from kratom use. Compare that to the annual number of alcohol-related deaths in the U.S.: 88,000 (https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics: \"Nearly 88,000 people ... die from alcohol-related causes annually, making alcohol the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States....\"). That's 241 deaths PER DAY from alcohol use in the United States alone. \nCompare alcohol or kratom deaths to the opioid death rate. The DEA and other government agencies are calling the current wave of opioid deaths an epidemic, at 28,000 annually (as of 2014, https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/). That's about 77 deaths per day from opioids. Other sources cite a 125-person-a-day opioid death rate ... but even at the higher rate, opioid deaths can't compete with alcohol deaths, which are nearly twice that of opioids. And kratom deaths? They don't even register. \nIf we want to address a real public health threat, the focus should be on alcohol, not on a substance of which most people have never heard. (Webster's Unabridged Dictionary doesn't have an entry for \"kratom\" or \"ketum\" as of November 2016.) By comparison to street drugs, alcohol and tobacco are the hands-down winners of the lethality contest. \nThe Office of National Drug Control Policy admits \"we cannot simply arrest our way out of the drug problem\" (see https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/Fact_Sheets/opioids_fact_sheet.pdf). Yet the DEA's standard procedure is to \"save\" a person from ruining his or her life with drugs by completely ruining his or her life with a prison record. You can recover from a drug habit, but you can never recover from a prison record. An individual's life, particularly a drug user's life, is beneath contempt - in truth, the only thing the DEA cares about is increasing its budget and power. To date, the DEA's drug war has cost taxpayers more than a trillion dollars. Scheduling of kratom is just another moneymaker. \nStop the classification/scheduling of kratom and its components. \nNo. More. Drug. War.

Just like every other herbal supplement, it doesn't work for everyone. I'm writing on behalf of those it does help because if you ban it, a lot of people will be robbed of the one thing that helps them cope. \n\nBecause of your interest, Facebook groups were created and you have former drug users counseling those who want to quit. They're taking the time to give advice and explaining to addicts that they can also become productive members of society. If you ban kratom now, you sign their death certifcates. You're going to turn those same groups into ones of despair, hopelessness, addiction, talks of suicide, and death. I watched it happen in my chronic pain group with the attack on opioids, please don't make me watch it again. The war on drugs never worked.\n\nI think there should be guidelines in place in regard to purity and it should be labeled like other herbal supplements.

I can now experience life with my children.   I can go to the grocery store.   I can sit through a movie.   I can do things that others take for granted.

I was addicted to taking opioids after having a pretty bad car accident and being prescribed them. It was to the point where I was spending lots of money on extras because I had to have them just to not go through withdrawals. I never did turn over and go to heroin BUT I do have a few friends that did go that route unfortunately. I had no idea that I could go to a methadone clinic for pain medication addiction until I finally talked to a drug abuse counselor here in MI which let me know I could. I got admitted and started taking methadone which really did help me to kick the opioid addiction I had. But then it was all about getting off of methadone. Even just bringing down my dosage the smallest bit was pretty hard on my body and it would've taken me FOREVER to get off of methadone completely. I then took to doing research on the internet and found multiple publishings that said Kratom could help me to completely get off of methadone. I bought about a months worth and started taking it just like I would take the methadone every single morning. I can attest that this didn't get me high whatsoever but it did help me to feel much much better physically and after just a week of taking it I wanted to see if I could stop taking the methadone and be ok. I was ok!!! I didn't need to take it anymore and I could easily be up and around without taking any methadone. This was great and I made sure that I was still ok after another week of not taking methadone and I was ok. I ordered another 2 weeks of Kratom and gradually cut down on my dosage amount. To this day I'm very very thankful to this wonderful plant because it helped me to become completely free of BOTH prescription pain killers AND the methadone!! I really think that this should be looked at totally different from other plants because of this MAIN reason. I wouldn't be surprised if the drug companies are behind the pushing of this drug being made illegal honestly. It should be researched more and see that this plant can be used instead of methadone or to help others get off of methadone quicker than normal. I felt extremely guilty about how much the state of MI was being charged per dosage of methadone that I was taking. The Kratom was way cheaper per dose and I was extremely happy to find that it did help me to no longer depend on methadone. \nPlease take this seriously because it saved my life and i'm positive it can save so many other lives as well. It could also save our states money instead of using methadone which itself makes you addicted. We can't just trade one addiction for another and hope that people will become independent on one or the other. PLEASE do the right thing and do much more research on this plant because the only side effect that I had was not being able to use the bathroom as much (backed up) which was much much worse when I was actually taking hydrocodone and other pain medications. Please let this plant stay a plant and help others out like it did me. I only had to be on methadone for a total of 3 months. Given I was head strong about not being addicted to any drugs and was going to stop no matter what this plant really helped the physical aspects of the addiction that I was experiencing. It was horrible but the kratom took ALL of those physical problems I was having away and helped me become clean. I have been clean now for over 4 years and haven't relapsed to either pain meds, methadone, OR kratom. \nI would even be happy if you do schedule this as a drug BUT you make it available for doctors to prescribe just for what I've already let you know I used it for. I understand why you might think it's important to make it illegal if you go off of reading about how people write online about getting high off of Kratom. I never got any kind of high or stimulation from it other than feeling extremely happy that I no longer had to depend on taking methadone and being dependent on it. I also was in total bliss that I no longer had to depend on my state and cost them lots of money to help me pay for methadone which is outrageously priced and a whole other addiction in itself. \n\nPlease do the right thing here. It's not a drug that gets people high but more of a plant that helped someone stop from having to take a drug just to feel normal. When addiction from opioids kicks in you really don't get high taking them anymore. You just HAVE to take them to feel UNSICK. \nWith all of the addiction problems and people dying from heroin addiction all across our nation it would be really sad if you take this plant away from people knowing that it can help with the horrible heroin epidemic!\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and I hope it's opened your eyes to another viewpoint.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4033","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Horrigan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I found out about kratom a little over a year ago from my daughter who did research on my behalf, trying to find help for my painful condition.

This would put kratom, a plant helping millions of people suffering chronic and acute mental and physical conditions that is also safely easing the nation's opiate epidemic problem naturally, on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. It would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown kratom to be an effective painkiller that does not cause respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\n\tI came across Kratom through a friend, while looking for a replacement for social drinking.  I'm a responsible citizen and I no longer wished to take the chance of getting pulled over having had a single drink and letting that incident ruin my entire life.\n\n\tI was amazed when I found that kratom immediately helped eliminate chronic knee and lower back pain caused by 28 years of working in body shops and crawling around on my knees working on cars all day.  I have to believe that therein medicinal value to this wonderful plant, and all that testing will be stopped completely if the ban goes through, hence eliminating the the opportunity for an all natural pain reliever to be used by those of us who do not want to take the man-made poisons prescribed to us by doctors.\n\n\tKratom has given me my active lifestyle back.  I can run with my dogs in the park, play golf, ride my bicycle, bowl, and an entire host of things I could no longer do, due to the constant knee and back pain which I had been suffering from for 23 years before I found Kratom.\n\n\tConclusion: Kratom is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical drugs with important medicinal uses and has changed my life. I fear this action by the DEA will only lead to more tragic deaths of victims of the opiate epidemic.  I know that my own quality of life as a productive member of society will not be the same without kratom.\n\n\nSincerely,\nJeff McDonald\n25 W Plumosa Ln.\nLake Worth, FL 33467\n561-373-2453","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11490","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeff McDonald","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been suffering chronic back pain for 3+ years.  \nI did not and do not want to risk the dangers associated with highly addictive prescription pain medications.\nSo when I heard that the DEA wanted to put Kratom on the Schedule 1 list I immediately knew that it must be a highly effective natural remedy.  \nI researched this plant and it's history and usage and knew I had to try it.\nI have used Kratom 3-4 times a week in the evenings to relax tight knotted muscles in my back that have been causing chronic pain and disruption of my sleep.

Kratom immensely helps my pain and anxiety unlike my previous prescriptions, this is a natural plant that has worked wonders for me and hundreds of thousands of other individuals, most in the same position as me. I am a working adult, I do not drink alcohol, or any other illicit substance, this plant potentially saved my life, if not for this, I may have continued down the road of prescription opiates, and the dark road that follows. Please take into consideration all of the people that this plant has potentially saved from going down that same dark road, or has helped them get off that road. Thank you for your time in reading my short story. Just please take into consideration all of the hundreds of thousands of people this has helped/is helping.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5970","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anon anon","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Devin Sapelli.\naround 3 years ago i was diagnosed with an 8mm kidney stone. next time i went to the emergency room, about 1 month after my diagnosis, i was told i had another two 4mm kidney stones. over the next 2 years i consistently had 2-8mm kidney stones.my insurance at the time was not very good, so they resisted the idea of removing the stones with surgery.

Biologically it is related to coffee. It has been used for thousands of years medicinally throughout Asia and has been used for decades, if not hundreds of years, by many within the United States and other countries.  The therapeutic uses of Kratom are many.  It helps with physical pain, depression, stopping the use of other more harmful drugs, reducing withdrawal symptoms cause by stopping the use of other drugs (including but not limited to Heroin) PTSD, and anxiety.  It can also give a slight boost of energy similar to, but not as strong as, coffee.\n\nI would like to briefly tell you my history with Kratom.  I am a 31 year old man.  I am gainfully employed.  I do not use any illegal drugs, I dont smoke, and I almost never drink.  I have suffered with OCD and depression since I was about 13 years old.  I have been on multiple medications with moderate success but never truly was free from depression.  About six years ago, while researching what might help me with my depression, I came across information about Kratom.  I ordered a small amount and gave it a try.  To make a long story short Kratom completely eliminated my depression.  \n\nMy life has only gotten better since I started taking Kratom.  I have gotten promotions at work, and was even given the award of employee of the year (out of about 350 employees I was number 1).  I met a girl about 5 years ago and just recently got engaged.  I will be a first time homeowner within the next few months.  The reason I mention these things is to point out that I am not some drug addict ruining his life just trying to get high.  I am an everyday taxpaying American and I dont want to see what has been a solution in my life be taken away.\n\nKratom is in the coffee family.  If taken regularly it is about as addictive as coffee.  Even if Kratom were extremely addictive as they say (it is not), it has saved thousands of lives of people who have used it to help them get off of heroin or other opioids (one of the MANY benefits of Kratom).  The Internet is filled with stories of people that have had their life improved, if not saved, by Kratom.  I am one of these people.  All of the cases the DEA outlines in which Kratom was correlated with someones death involved that person taking other (usually multiple) harmful drugs at the same time.  Their deaths were caused by the other drug and often involved an underlying medical condition as well.  If someone were eating icecream and using meth at the same time, and died, I suppose one could say that ice cream was correlated with the persons death, but common sense would dictate it was probably the meth that killed him.   Trying to pin someones death on Kratom in these situations without any scientific basis  (in fact the scientific studies that have been done indicate that Kratom is relatively safe) is downright irresponsible.\n\nAs far as the calls to poison control; As scientific journalist and forbes magazine writer David Kroll pointed out: the 660 phone calls to poison control was over a 5 year period.  In comparison, there were 6,843 calls to poison control in the last 7 months regarding a child being poisoned by laundry detergent pods.  I would like to add that most of the Kratom related poison control phone calls involved a stomachache or other minor issue and the person ended up being fine.  \n\nKratom is not an opioid.  Period.  It is biologically in the coffee family.  It acts partially on opioid receptors, which is why it helps people stop using heroin and also why it helps with depression.  Kratom does not cause respiratory depression.  It is sometimes incorrectly stated that it does because of people unfortunately grouping it in with true opioids.  Kratom actually helps people stop using opioids, including heroin and fentanyl, two substances that are actually dangerous.  Even if Kratom were an opioid I would think this fact alone would be sufficient in keeping Kratom legal.\n\nI apologize for the length of this letter but I am extremely concerned about the direction the government is taking regarding Kratom.  If Kratom were to be scheduled/ banned the portion of individuals that use Kratom to stay off of heroin and other opioids is likely to have many return to opioids for relief of the pain they were originally using opioids for.  There will be overdoses, and people will die.  There will be many deaths because of this ban.  There will also be many, like me, that will have their quality of life stripped away because of the ban.   I am honestly worried about having to return to the depression I once lived with because I will no longer have Kratom available to me.  There are millions of people like me. \n\nThe public is clearly stating they dont want this substance to be banned or scheduled.  \n\nThank you for your time and service to the American people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7608","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erik Knorr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a physician in Vermont.

Medical outcomes associated with kratom exposure were reported as minor (minimal signs or symptoms, which resolved rapidly with no residual disability) for 162 (24.5%) exposures, moderate (non-life threatening, with no residual disability, but requiring some form of treatment) for 275 (41.7%) exposures, and major (life-threatening signs or symptoms, with some residual disability) for 49 (7.4%) exposures.

I believe that restricting access to these substances will have strongly negative unintended consequences, particularly in the forms of encouraging further opiate addictions (already a huge problem in this country) as well as creating an entirely new swathe of nominal \"criminals,\" with little to no reasonable medical basis. The people most pushing this legislation are those who stand to make the most money from these consequences. However, the people who stand to gain the most from Kratom's continued legal status are average Americans. Personally, I do not use Kratom regularly, but in my experience, it is a viable alternative to ADHD medications which I am currently prescribed. As ADHD medications are derivatives from amphetamines and related stimulants, and because we lack long term science on their effects on the body, I believe that we need to continue to keep the marketplace of ideas open, and allow alternative treatments to be pursued. Relegating these Kratom alkaloids to the dust heap of drugs that are Schedule I is a virtual guarantee that any medical efficacy to be derived from them will be squandered in the name of \"the war on drugs.\" As we have seen, this \"war\" is unwinnable, and has resulted in huge portions of our population possessing criminal records that preclude them from fruitful participation in society. I implore you, as a liberty-leaning compatriot, to please take the side of freedom and liberty, which this country was founded upon, and continue to allow the use of these substances without penalty unless and until there is evidence based reasoning to do otherwise.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16842","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonathon Bischof","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have suffered horrible Chronic back pain since 1979.

I am certain you are aware of its benefits in treating chronic pain and opiate addiction. I am also sure you know how safe it actually is. To pretend that you have any evidence that there fatalities involving kratom is just silly. Anyone who spends more then 5 minutes researching this subject quickly learns that those claims are nonsense. I am saying this because if you follow through with banning kratom you will lose even more credibility then you already have. I believe there are many good people with good intentions at the DEA but this is the wrong battle. This is not U-4700 (assuming you know what that I mean by that). I would be willing to bet that whoever reads this has known someone personally who has had their life ruined by addiction, depression or severe chronic pain and I would be shocked and disgusted if you were more interested in protecting the interest of the pharmaceutical industry then the health and well being of people you know or care about. That is exactly what the majority of us think you are doing here. Whether its right or wrong that is the perception. Even if you ban kratom do you actually think anyone who currently uses it will stop in favor of more dangerous, more addicting, prescription, schedule 2 narcotics? I very seriously doubt it. Of the ones who do, some will die and it'll probably be far more people then what  kratom has allegedly \"killed\".  I agree that it should not be sold to minors at gas stations but that is an easy fix. I give kratom to my 15 year old dog. He was a rescue and abused before I got him. It is the only thing I have found that allows him to be mobile and have a quality life. The only other option for pain that a vet will give him is tramadol. This makes him very sedated and sick and also increases his chances of having seizures, which he has had a history of since he was young. I chose kratom over tramadol for good reason. Do the right thing and restore our faith in you. Do not make my dog a drug abusing felon.

Otherwise it would seem that the government's only goal is to get people to buy more alcohol and less of other substances that are more helpful, less destructive and better for their health.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5755","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Franco","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been hearing a lot of good things about kratom and I believe that there should be more research done before it is made illegal","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12239","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Grayson Barbot","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I AM A 72 YEAR OLD MALE WITH SEVERE LOWER BACK PAIN AND SUFFER FROM EXTREME ANXIETY DUE TO SERVICE CONNECTED PTSD.

I find it difficult to believe that if you did any research or investigating on the subject you would not come to the conclusion of banning this supplement as a schedule 1. I use this plant as a supplement to coffee. I find caffeine much more addictive and dangerous than Kratom. If you check the numbers of deaths, and emergency visits caffeine is far more dangerous. So why don't you ban coffee? Kratom is a relative to coffee, so it would only make sense that you went after coffee. But, we both know that is not something you can ban. I use it to not use caffeine, but other use it to not use alcohol, heroin/ pain killers and other dangerous drugs. My boyfriend uses it for his chronic back pain. If you ban this, you are telling people to use that over Kratom, because the legal risks are similar. If you ban this plant, you are sending people to their graves. I hope you understand this. Why would you even make this an option; no logic to it? Please do the right thing, do your homework, and I know you will make the right decision.\n\nThank you very much for listening.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11877","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jessica Friedman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom (Mitra speciosa), has and is been, and is being used safely, without causing harm for hundreds of years.

However, over the last 2 years or so life stresses have grown and so has the increase of sinus attacks. I tried all the OTC medications, including flonase, and graduated to all allergy medications ending with \"-D\". Still not success in relieving the symptoms.\n\nThe symptoms I experienced include chronic sneezing and thus blowing my nose. It is not rare to experience on average 5 or so sneezes per minute and using up a box of kleenex within a couple hours. The body becomes exhausted and aches, and sinus pain is unbearable. I visited my doctor whom would prescribe me medications like steroids and antibiotics. I visited urgent care whom the physician declared ludicrousy about prescriving steroids, but who prescribed 800mg Ibuprofen. \n\nI was given finally given Norco which got the sneezing to stop, but was only prescribed a count of 17 to get me from one appointment to the next as I was referred to an ENT. The ENT did diagnose a deviated septum but would not prescribe anything with codeine. I eventually gave up going from one appointment to the next as the last visit I made was to the ER because symptoms were so bad, however, the nurse/doctor prescribed me everything I just told her that didn't work. At this point I'm feeling helpless from waiting months from one appointment to the next and no successful prescriptions to alleviate my symptoms.\n\nA friend of mine then offered Kratom. She gave me half a teaspoon and stopped the sneezing. I now take 2 half teaspoons daily while back on the search for a specialist who can treat the cause. My family has expressed their observation of the symptoms subsiding and my decrease in moodiness from feeling beaten down by the sinus attacks.\n\nIn the midst of all this I also developed tennis elbow. It got so bad I had trouble sleeping at night, and to turn the body I had to use my other arm just to lift one arm so I can turn. Eventually, tennis elbow developed in the other arm and I had to buy the Copper Elbow sleeve. I was taking ibuprofen to help with inflammation and using Icy Hot to help relieve the pain. \n\nKratom has helped to stop the pain. I hadn't realized the pain was even gone until one night it dawned I hadn't put on my sleeve. I can sleep better at night and use my arms without the sharp pains that run down to my wrists when picking up objects.\n\nThe smallest dose of Kratom has made the biggest difference in the body feeling comfortable again until I find a more permanent solution.\n\nI also gave some to my dad who has 3 fractured discs in his spine from falling off a latter whom expressed how fast it worked and how well he felt. My mother as well has arthritis and takes one dose (1/4 teaspoon) at night, and has also expressed how much the pain subsides.\n\nKratom is not something you feel the need to take more of, as I stated earlier, for the smallest dose can make the biggest difference.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2028","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Howard Crampton Jr Intl","postedDate":"2016-10-28T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Howard Crampton Jr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 48 year old man who uses kratom periodically for the improvement of my life, not as a party drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22764","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I urge you to cancel your plans to ban Kratom for the following reasons:\n1.

I discovered this Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, commonly referred to as Kratom, due to a chronic illness which creates pain, exhaustion and brain fog.  I was bed-ridden for months living on Advil and Tramadol, which left me spacey and nauseous.  I was unable to run my businesses, which adversely effected my business and all the other tax paying individuals that my business employes. Kratom made it possible for me to function in blocks of time, without danger of an overdose or addiction.  Given my success and those of my fellow tax-payers who have also turned to Kratom, I strongly believe Kratom should NOT be classified as a Class 1 drug for a multitude of reasons:\n\nOpiate addiction kills approximately 40 people a day in the US, alone.  Kratom is one of the ways to mitigate this issue!  It uses the opiate uptake receptor, in effect blocking the addict from getting 'high.'  The current studies in this area would be discontinued. Simultaneously, the DEA is going to restrict opiate production. What are those in pain going to do?\n\nThe DEA references a number of deaths, however, not one single death was due to Kratom, rather they were due to cocktails of other medications, including Kratom. A number of them were due to Fentanyl. \n\nIn my case, I have not needed an opiate pain medication for almost a year, and have instead, been able to increase my work-load while chronically ill, due to the benefits of Kratom.  And to be clear, if I don't need the medication on  any given day, I don't suffer from withdrawals, or other deleterious symptoms if I do not use Kratom. \n\nI am better able to be a parent and a wife. Pain can make a person unpleasant to be around, (it certainly does with me), and not suffering has certainly helped me continue to be a loving wife and parent. \n\nAnd because Big Pharma has now patented the active ingredients, that is somehow better than the existing product?  Ridiculous assumption and one that makes many Americans suspicious of the FDA and DEA, and the belief in a corrupt system. \n\nI hope that my voice and the millions of others who utilize this plant as a relief from pain while alleviating our need for opiate drugs are able to keep our chosen, safe way to deal with pain.

Over 20 years she has been prescribed and taking medications for back pain. I was only a kid when she first started taking opiates per her doctor to help with increasing back problems. It wasn't long before I noticed the changes. She essentially \"tuned out and dropped out\" of life and of being a mother. She was a real estate agent and worked her own schedule, which started to dwindled down. She began sleeping all the time, ignoring family responsibilities and personal obligations. When she wasn't on her medication she became violent, verbally abusive, and psychologically abusive to everyone around her, even me. I even remember witnessing her overdose on dilantin, opiates, and alcohol at the age of seven! We were home alone and I saw her fall out of bed and hit her head on the corner of the night stand. I called 911 and then went to the neighbors for help. Until recently she has been struggling with drug addiction and had pushed everyone in her life away. She would lie, cheat, and steal to sustain her habit. I was only contacting her just to verify she was still alive, I had to keep her at a distance because she would even try to manipulate me to get money.\n\nA couple years back one of my close friends (Josh) beat cancer and was in remission but still having problems with pain and was getting caught up in a serious opiate addiction. His partner (Ian) was the one that found out about kratom from online support groups. Josh was able to ween himself from the opiates with the use of kratom. After witnessing Josh's turnaround and being able to kick his opiate habit I reached out to my mother. I asked her if  she would be willing to try this tea that has helped people get off opiates. She reluctantly said yes, and I was able to purchase some online and ship it to her with instructions on how to prepare tea. She making tea and reporting back that it didn't taste good at all, but it did help with her pain, and withdraw symptoms when she didn't have pills. Fast forward to 2016, I can say that she has all but weened herself off of opiate pills (prescription and black market) and uses kratom tea and OTC pain medicine a couple times a week as needed to help control her pain. What I didn't expect to happen is to see a junkie slowly transform back into a mother. She came back to me and my siblings after 20 years of being gone from opiates. I'm tearing up just writing about this. We have a family in the midst of being rebuilt thanks to the use of kratom tea! At the same time it's bitter sweet. It hurts as much as it's a relief because of where the DEA and FDA stand on this herbal tea moving forward. I'm scared that we may lose what took us 20 years to find! I'm scared that without access to kratom tea my mother will slip back into opiates. I'm scared that there will not be another chance and she could be gone for good. \n\nI hope that the DEA and FDA take a strong look at the evidence from studies before making a rash decision on banning a substance that poses little to no public threat. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) released a December 2015 report titled Kratom -Mitragyna speciosa, The Impact to Florida and found, Kratom does not currently constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents. Additionally the report sites that the Florida Department of Health found there are no pervasive health issues can be attributed to the ingestion Kratom products in Florida. Other individuals in the medical field have voiced their concerns with the response from the DEA and FDA as well. Ryan Estevez, MD, Tampa Bay,Florida: In recent years, kratom has been widely misrepresented as dangerous and without medical value. These disturbing labels overlook the fact that valuable remedies and dietary supplements derived from kratom benefit lives. Kratom, in fact, is not a drug at all: It is a plant derivative no more dangerous than a cup of coffee.Jane Maxwell, Research Professor at the Addiction Research Institute at the University of Texas: When asked about the impact and presence of kratom across the U.S., Its pretty minor.\n\nBy placing the active ingredients in kratom on schedule 1, will all but make it impossible for scientific research and data collection. Thereby loosing what could be a potentially life saving treatment option for millions of Americans struggling with opiate addiction, struggling to maintain a family, and struggling to maintain what it is to be a moral human being.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1358","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Sandberg","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I would like to start by saying kratom has been a joy to have access to. It's provided much needed anxiety relief as well as pain relief. I have slight arthritis in my neck and anxiety that starting occurring just a few years ago that I've dealt with. I've taken upwards of over an oz a day and at times haven't stopped taking it because it helps with my stamina as well as being a good immune system booster. I used to get sick very often, but haven't because of kratom too. A neighbor of mine started taking it to help with opiod withdrawal and pain relief. They passed away from what was most likely cardiac arrest due to a fentanyl overdose that happened in January of 2016. The reports of respiratory depression are not common. I have never experience this type of effect. Only positive effects have happened and I take multiple supplements such as vitamin c, choline, and just regular amino acids and stuff like that.\n  I feel so much better than I did a few years ago. The 15 deaths that happened to date from kratom had to of involved more substances combined with it. It's something that has been used for years. Banning this will not only result in more deaths, but think of all the people that will be suffering from prescription pain killer abuse that take kratom to help with everyday things I also mentioned. What purpose would that serve? 15 deaths vs many more for tobacco use and alcohol abuse. My father has been struggling with nicotine addiction to cigarette smoking. He has COPD and GERD. I'm watching him die slowly everyday. Kratom has a good effect on breathing. My neighbors mom takes it and breathes better, has pain relief, and more energy. \n Like I mentioned, I have only had good effects. Constipation which is common with all opiate/opioids happens from time to time. You have to eat well and drink enough water alongside different things you take. But this is a beneficial plant with not much abuse. I've had quite a bit when I first took it and threw up once from having eaten it on an empty stomach. This also happened one day when I woke up and had a cup of green tea. It's a bitter herb. It's a good herb. I need this and so do many others. Do the good of people and help us by not banning this. Help this world move in the right direction because all we've seen is one going in a bad one. I'm tired of seeing people lose their battle to addiction of heroin and far worse pain killers that are just not coherent with the body we live with in life. I lost my aunt to heroin addiction. I lost friends to heroin addiction. This can save lives and it has. That is all.

Along with hundreds of thousands of responsible adults, I include kratom in my regimen of natural supplements, along with St. John's Wort, vitamin D and fish oil.  I find that partaking in kratom tea is beneficial for the occasional aches and pains that I experience in the course of my busy, demanding and productive life. Kratom also seems to have the added benefit of  alleviating anxiety. I find the propaganda that presents kratom as a dangerous drug is incredibly disingenous, as I have have never suffered a single negative side effect in the 3 years of having used kratom tea.  Only mild and healthful benefits. \n\n\nThe fact that the DEA attempted to emergency schedule kratom - citing an imminent threat to public safety - seems ludicrous and highly suspect.  As a R & D chemist for the past 15 years, I am well-accustomed to researching thoroughly any substances that I am unfamiliar with.  I became aware of kratom several years ago and read copious amounts of information, both anecdotal and scientific, before I considered the decision to try the natural supplement. In my research I have seen absolutely no cause for concern or alarm that using kratom leaf could cause negative consequences.  And as an intelligent adult, I feel the decision to include any substance to my health regimen is my decision and mine alone.  Most recently, I read that an informal survey of emergency room doctors and nurses has revealed zero need for concern over kratom in emergency rooms and hospitals in America. This was not surprising in the least, since I was already well aware that kratom has been used for centuries in Indonesia without a single reported death.\n\n\nIf America should continue to insist upon a prohibitionist policy in the so called \"war on drugs\" (which we all know is an abject, costly and socially devastating failure), then the DEA should put it's considerable time and resources toward genuinely harmful and dangerous substances, in the hopes of saving lives.  Kratom should never have been in the crosshairs of any DEA campaign.  In conclusion, I'd like to be made aware of the DEAs and FDAs scientific evidence that purported to find that kratom ever posed a threat to public safety, if such scientific evidence actually exists.  As a scientist I am keenly interested in factual proof that would refute not only my research of the botanical kratom, but my personal experience with the leaf on a nearly daily basis - with zero negative effects.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nBernard Balling","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20038","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Bernard Balling","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Regarding Docket No. DEA-442W\n\nEight years ago I was diagnosed with chronic pain from arthritis, fibromyalgia and related neuropathy. I was prescribed an inclining degree of first non-opiate (anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxers, even anti-depressants) and then opiate medications: Tramadol, Codeine, Hydrocodone, Opana, Fentanyl, Oxycodone, and eventually Morphine. The time I spent in pain management was horrific, and no matter what, my opiate dependency became worse and worse as time went on. As a parent, I was doing my children no amount of justice taking these medications which only really succeeded in raising my pain tolerance, and requiring more and more medication to function.\n\nWhen I found kratom (Mitragynine), it was a last-ditch effort to try to get off the opiates, as my doctors and I felt they weren't helping me anymore, but really just obstructing any positive directions of my life. But for so long I felt I was trapped, as I didn't have any other reasonable options. Since finding kratom, I have used it to manage my pain ever since. \n\nOpiates used to make me feel \"high\" and as such I would need to take more and more to obtain the same level of pain relief, inhibiting my daily function. While I was taking opiate medication, I lived in constant fear of overdosing or just taking too much due to the sheer number of prescriptions I was given at the time. I frequently wrote good-bye letters to my children in the case that a morning came when I did not wake up. I taught my 4-year old how to dial 911 on my cell phone in case he woke up one morning and I could not.  I was unable to work, as even though my dependency on the opiates I was prescribed was through the roof, they still did not manage the level of pain I was dealing with. \n\nKratom is a completely different story. With kratom, I don't get \"high\" and I have never been tempted to take more than a needed dose, as there is nothing to be gained from overuse.  I have never overdosed on kratom. I have never feared not waking up after using it, as it does not depress my CNS function or respiration the way opiates did. \n\nIn eight years, I have not developed a tolerance to kratom the way I did on opiates. I have never needed to increase the level of my dose in that amount of time. \n\nI was able to replace every pain medication prescription I ever had with a daily dose of kratom, as it provides just enough pain relief so that I can function through my day. I have found that Iam now able to be a good parent to my children, and without the level of pain I was feeling before, I can be active with them, and share in their lives. I no longer fear not waking up due to an opiate overdose, even an accidental one.\n\nSince giving up opiates for kratom, I've been able to work a full-time job and support my family on a level that I was never able to with that pharmacological addiction.\n\nIf kratom use is restricted and banned from the use I am accustomed to, I will need to return to the doctors to manage my chronic pain, and the opiates that I was so happy to leave behind. That thought strikes fear into my heart. I really don't want to regress to that. I think using kratom was very much a positive move to manage the pain I am unable to manage any other way.\n\nIf I had to continue on the amount of opiate pain medication I had to take I do not believe that I would be alive today.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19758","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"N Ruiz","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, Im a 62 year old mother and grandmother.  I work as a store manager at a clothing store in a big mall.  I have to climb ladders, lift boxes, walk and stand for long hours at a time.  I also have to deal with the public, which can cause anxiety.  I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis and PTSD (from past domestic violence).  It started with me taking ibuprofen to help ease the pain and headaches.  I was on Xanax for anxiety and then Vicodin for pain.  Taking pills became a lifestyle.  I needed energy to work, so I became addicted to prescription Adderall.  When I moved to another state, it became increasingly difficult to get the Adderall and the painkillers due to state restrictions.  I was taking more than I could get in a months time.  The ibuprofen has now given me Barretts esophagus which can lead to esophageal cancer.   So, here I was, an addicted, hyper, anxious, chronic pain sufferer.  Life, to me, was pills!  I was fed up and was sick and tired of being sick and tired.  In October 2014, I started searching the internet for safe, herbal alternatives.  I came across kratom.  Intrigued, I did more research and found the American Kratom Association (AKA).  Found a reliable vendor and bought a small 28 gram packet of kratom.  I took about 2 grams (a teaspoon) of the ground green powder and made a tea.  I didnt know what to expect, but figured it couldnt hurt.  After 20 minutes, I noticed that my anxiety and some of my back pain was melting away.  It was like drinking a great cup of coffee and eating a bit of comfort food.  I couldn't believe this was a legal, herbal supplement and it was working! I was overjoyed!  I can ditch these pills and drink a tea?  So, ever since, I drink my tea in the morning and Ive found that I can work the long hours, I can deal with extremely difficult people with a smile, and I have more energy to do the things I need to get done.  I was happier than Ive been in a long long time!  The PTSD has melted away (yes, I still get a bit of anxiety from time to time, but mostly its short-lived).  If I go a few days without kratom, I dont feel any withdrawals like I did with the amphetamines and painkillers.  I just feel a bit more tired. Virtually, no side effects or addiction problems. I no longer needed the pills and in January 2015, I was completely off of them. \nThen, in August of 2016, I received an email from the AKA and read the bad news. Kratom was being banned and classified a Schedule I drug (next to heroin, which by the way, killed two of my friends and my beloved Godson) by the DEA. I felt as if someone pulled the rug out from under me.  Why were they doing this to me and the millions of other sufferers who rely on an herbal tea to help them with chronic pain, addiction and anxiety?   I prayed and wrote to and called congressman, senators, and the DEA to plead with them to please rethink this ban.  If kratom is banned, I honestly dont know what Im going to do.  Back to the addicting pills?  More than likely I would lose my job.  I wouldnt be able to stand the long hours and deal with people like I can now.  I couldnt run and play with the grandchildren anymore.  My relationships would suffer.  I would become disabled due to the chronic pain.  Please, kratom is NOT addictive, has NO side effects, helps with chronic pain, helped me and a few of my friends kick the pill and/or alcohol habit.  I've never felt \"high\" on kratom.   Its a natural, safe, non-addicting tea, NOT a drug.  I sure wish I knew about kratom a few years back, it couldve saved my Godsons life, as he was addicted to heroin.  He died from an overdose at age 29.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1610","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Keren Klingele","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I joined the US Navy in Los Angeles a week after 9/11 and am now a disabled vet lucky enough to survive an opiate addiction but still suffering from chronic pain and anxiety.\n\nPlease understand that making safer alternatives illegal destroys lives and kills Americans.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9716","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Carlos Lemell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has givin myself and many others our lives back that I once thought impossible, without the life altering side effects many experience from pharmaceuticals.

I am married and have a 17 year old daughter. I am asking that you please reconsider your intent to schedule kratom. This plant has been used safely around the world for centuries, possibly even longer. It has an effect on opioid receptors so automatically an assumption is made that it will somehow add to the opiate epidemic. The exact OPPOSITE is true. Chocolate and wheat also have an effect on opioid receptors, as do MANY other everyday things. There are an estimated 3-5 million kratom consumers in the U.S. The vast majority of these people take kratom in order to help themselves lead better and more productive lives. Furthermore, this plant is a Godsend for those who do not want to become addicted to, or remain addicted to dangerous and addictive pain medications. By the DEA's own admission, heroin and opiate painkillers are their biggest problem right now. It's completely obvious that kratom helps keep people AWAY from these substances. The potential in this herbal supplement should have the DEA and FDA jumping for joy. Instead, they are trying to ban it. It's no wonder people are questioning the agencies' motives, accusing them of protecting the interests of Pharmaceutical companies. It's hard to fathom any other explanation for a decision that is so Illogical and contradictory.\n\nThere is nothing else on Earth, as far as I know, which helps relieve pain and withdrawal symptoms so well. It helped me over six years ago when I was desperate to be free of the slavery that is opiate dependence. I was hospitalized for over a month in 2004. I was the victim of a rare side effect of birth control pills. They caused me to develop liver tumors. One of these tumors ruptured, causing massive internal bleeding and shock. I nearly died. Over half of my liver was removed and I was put in an induced coma. The pain was agonizing and I received high doses of pain medication for an extended period of time. This left me hopelessly dependent on opiates to function. Over time, I developed other health issues which were treated with even more pain medication. Today, thanks to kratom, I have my life back. I am no longer stuck in bed, depressed, and unable to function. Life has meaning once again. Without access to this supplement, countless peoples' lives will be negatively impacted, possibly even ruined.\n\nIf kratom is taken away, the only legal option that will be available to so many unfortunate souls are dangerous poisons such as Methadone and Suboxone. In many ways these options are worse than opiate pain pills and heroin because of their long half-life. The withdrawal from these long-acting drugs is a drawn out nightmare that can extend for months or longer. Quitting Methadone or Suboxone is a nightmarish act of courage that not everyone can or will endure. \n\nSadly, too many people have been afraid to talk about how much kratom has helped them for fear that it would be taken away. Now this dreadful scenario appears to be coming true.  People are very passionate about saving kratom because they or other family members are living testimonials to the benefits of this miraculous supplement.\n\nKratom has been used safely and effectively in America for decades and does NOT cause respiratory depression. The DEA notes that there were 660 calls to poison control centers over the course of five years. To put that in perspective, there were 150,530 calls to poison control about personal cosmetics in only ONE year! Here's the link: www.poison.org/poison-statistics-national\n\nThe overwhelming majority of kratom consumers are 35+ years of age and purchase kratom from ethical online vendors. Kratom has a very limited recreational capacity, and nearly all kratom consumers take it to help with their general well-being. This includes helping them ease pain, PTSD, and dependency issues.\n\nPeople should be able to make up their own minds and find ways to manage their own health without the fear of becoming criminals. It's important for me to say that I do believe the DEA and FDA have the public's best interest at heart. However, an egregious error has been made here. Assumptions and knee-jerk reactions are never the appropriate way to handle things. The many thousands of stories about kratom helping people are more than enough proof that it has significant value. At this point there is no rebuttal that could EVER justify taking it away. Anyone can see that the benefits outweigh any risks by a million fold. Kratom should not be scheduled. It should be regulated like any other dietary supplement. Keeping kratom available is required to prevent imminent harm to the public. Anything less would be an act of cruelty and a profound injustice to the American people. Please stop the ban until more research can be done. The public cannot afford to wait around for years while government agencies play games with their lives.

I have gone through 6 week physical therapy programs on 3 separate occasions and do daily therapy exercises at home to strengthen the muscles in my back. The severity of my pain often causes me to miss work as well as limiting normal daily activities I can do with my 4 year old son. My spine specialist had prescribed me hydrocodone for the last 2 years in order to take the edge off of the pain...I suffered with this severe pain for years while trying to avoid having to resort to taking pain medication due to the risks that come along with it. I would only take my medication when I desperately needed it to avoid becoming dependent. I finally starting researching the internet about natural ways to control severe pain out of desperation to completely discontinue the use of pain medication and also find some sort of effective relief from this constant pain, which is when I came across Kratom. I read every article and piece of research I could find on this plant and decided to order a few samples from an online Kratom distribution store. I mixed half of a teaspoon with some juice and within half an hour my back pain was completely gone. Aside from the biggest feeling of relief I'd felt in years, the best part about this was the fact that I felt completely normal! I had zero side effects and my mind nor body felt altered in any way shape or form. Since then I've been continuing the use of Kratom, taking about 1/2-1 teaspoon in the morning just a few times a week and I have completely discontinued the use of pain medication. It has provided so much more relief than anything else I've tried...it has given me my quality of life back and I'm now able to do the things that I've always wanted to do with my son. I have never experienced any kind of recreationational value from this plant nor have I experienced any side effects. I honestly feel like Kratom could change the life of many chronic pain sufferers and greatly decrease the need for narcotic pain medication. I hope that you see the amazing benefits this plant could have in the world of chronic pain sufferers and really weigh out the benefits of keeping this substance legal.

If Kratom was not legal and easily accessible to me, I would not be able to hold down a job.  Therefore, I am desperately hoping that it is still going to be available to me in the future.\n\nIt is my belief that if Kratom is made a schedule 1 drug, or illegal to buy at all, there will be thousands of people like myself who will cease to live functional and full lives. I am against putting Kratom on any list of scheduled or controlled substances. \n\nI began using Kratom approximately three years ago in order to help with my crippling depression and anxiety. It helped me climb out of the dark hole that I was in, and see that maybe I could live in this world without constantly feeling afraid. In the beginning I used it quite a bit to lower my anxiety, and then lowered the dose over time to merely elevate my mood. After a period of months, my life had changed, and I naturally, without any conscious effort, stopped taking the Kratom. It never seemed addictive to me in the slightest.\n\nKratom came back into my life when I developed a nerve disorder about a year ago. When the pain flares up it completely disables me. Doctors are not sure what medications can help me, as this particular disorder is not well-researched yet. If I did not have Kratom available to me, in different strains on different days (to keep my tolerance down), my life would mostly consist of lying in bed wishing I was not alive. \n\nI fear that without Kratom, I would have to turn to opiates - and since that is not a approved medication for my nerve disorder, I fear the road that I will have to go down to get out of pain. Opiates would be the only thing that would numb the pain. Kratom doesn't numb anything. It works with my body in a way nothing else can. It doesn't get me \"high.\" I don't want to be high. I just want to live.\n\nThe benefits of Kratom have been immeasurable to me, life saving; and the negative consequences nonexistent.  Please, I sincerely ask you not to restrict my access to it.

I work as an urban farmer in Minneapolis. I strongly oppose any DEA effort to list Kratom as a schedule 1 drug. I have not personally taken Kratom but I know people who have used this plant safely and benefited from it's effects. I heard about this comment page from episode 876 of the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast with guest Chris Bell. He is a documentary filmmaker who uses Kratom to manage pain from arthritis. Kratom is a safe, non-addictive plant that he and a community of people are using to treat chronic pain without the use of dangerous opioid painkillers. According to the CDC, deaths from opioid painkiller overdoses have skyrocketed in recent years (www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html) and many people are currently struggling with addiction to these substances. If Kratom is a safe alternative for these people than I believe it is the DEA's obligation to keep it off of the schedule 1 list so that it can be studied further. We need to know more about the medicinal benefits and any potential side effects or addictive properties of this plant so that people in need can decide if this is a viable alternative. Even if there are some side effects (none have been proven thus far to my knowledge) we cannot deny people their personal sovereignty over what they choose to use to treat their symptoms. Especially when the alternative of opioid painkillers has risen to the epidemic of death and addiction that we see today. Many veterans are using this substance to treat their pain after recovering from opioid addiction, should they be denied the right to take Kratom if it has proven to be effective for them? No. Please do not list Kratom, or any alkaloids present in Kratom as schedule one.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11819","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Kuhn","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In the interest of scientific inquiry and compassion this supplement should remain legal long enough for a thorough and peer reviewed body of study to be formed around this substance.

I started using Kratom roughly 5 years ago to help me stay focused at work in the late afternoons. It has proven excellent for this  similar to a cup of coffee, but without the jitteriness. I have also found, over this time, that it is very helpful during periods where I would normally be wracked with seasonal allergies (spring and fall). I find I have been very productive at work while taking kratom, and during this time, the company has placed me on several high profile projects. I usually have a single cup of kratom tea, typically in the late afternoon. Occasionally, I will drink two cups per day, if my day is particularly demanding.\n\nMy last physical showed that I am in excellent health - no problems noted. I exercise almost daily and I have not had any issues outside of what I would expect due to my age. There are also many times during the year where I find I do not need kratom, and during those times, I have never noticed any ill effects from stopping.\n\nI have read that some people are using kratom to get an opioid-like high, but this doesnt make sense. It just doesnt have that effect  I would think that anyone taking kratom for the \"high\" would be disappointed! I guess that this is why it hasnt been a social or law enforcement problem in the United States, like (for example) prescription pain medications, despite what appear to be a very significant number of users.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when I found out that the DEA intended to schedule something thats been such a helpful addition to my life! I am concerned that I would not maintain the same alertness at work, and my seasonal allergies would be back full-force, if kratom were taken away completely. I would therefore ask that you not schedule this substance, but keep it accessible to those of us that find it useful. Scheduling kratom would be a mistake.\n\nThank you for considering my comments, and for allowing a comment period after the initial notice to schedule.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14288","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To Whom It May Concern:\nMy name is Casey Navarre, I'm a 29 year old who works a full time job at a major hospital in the Greater Detroit Area. I currently assist with any and all IT related support and how the IT infrastructure groups work with one another to complete tasks and ultimately resolve IT related issues. I'm writing you today to express my opinion that I strongly oppose the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances. I started taking Kratom about two years ago. In fact the supplement greatly helped me to stop taking prescription opiates which were given to me after brain surgery at the age of 9 years old. For as many years as I can remember I've had doctors trying to find out why I had headaches and pain, but finally a doctor decided to treat my pain and prescribed prescription opiates. This however only worked for a brief amount of time and I then became physically addicted to the prescription opiates. I wish I would have known then what I do now about Kratom and the opportunities the supplement presents. The fact that it is easily obtainable, makes it so more and more universities studying this can look further into cures for opiate dependence.\nIf it poses a public health risk, more so than cigarettes or alcohol then yes it should be on the schedule 1 banned substances list. However, multiple articles, facts, and information all prove the point that Kratom alone is safe and non addictive  or as addictive as caffeine/coffee.\n\nPlease in this case I urge you to reconsider, if you do really care about public safety and one day ending the epidemic that is addiction, then do not make Kratom's two active ingredients a schedule 1 narcotic. Please work with recovering addicts to find better solutions to what is currently in place and ultimately allow for newer, better treatments and medications to be created instead of stopping the growth that has already come from people utilizing this supplement.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9688","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Casey Navarre","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In the hopes that this will help prevent the DEA's decision from scheduling the chemical components of a safe alternative to highly addictive pain medication (during a national opiate epidemic, no less) I have decided to share my experiences with Kratom.\n\nI began using Kratom as an alternative to opiate painkillers (hydrocodone, oxycodone, tramadol) as a means of managing pain associated with numerous sports injuries accumulated over the years (herniated disc with sciatica, torn TCCF, torn AC ligament from multiple shoulder dislocations - those are only the major ones).  While I am fortunate enough to be mostly mobile, I live with constant pain.  Physical therapy has done wonders to restore function, but doesn't do much for the pain.  Surgery is a risk I'm not currently willing to undergo.  \n\nFearing the possibility of addiction after seeing numerous friends and one family member wind up in the hospital from opiate overdose (and two friends die from overdose), I would typically rotate through several opiate medications with 'off' periods between dosing cycles.  This was typically a month-on, month-off arrangement.  Synthetic opiates were at best effective for two weeks, after which time the pain would start to seep back in.  Terrified to up the dosage, I would keep taking the same dose and suffer through the less-effective treatment.  So, for 6 weeks out of every 8 I was not able to lift my right arm above my head, rotate my right wrist, bend or twist at the waist, or squat without severe pain.  During the four weeks I was on painkillers, I traded constant gnawing pain for constipation, difficulty sleeping, nausea, and mental confusion.  Plus, the overarching fear that I would wind up a pharma-junkie.\n\nI was turned on to Kratom in January of 2016 by a well-meaning \"herbalist\" hippie-type (I live near Boulder CO).  Usually I don't place any faith in that sort of pseudoscience, so I was amazed to find that Kratom actually worked to treat my symptoms.  In an attempt to be cautious, I initially stuck with my opiate dosing schedule - 4 weeks on, 4 weeks off.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were very minor side effects - no itchiness, no difficulty sleeping, mild nausea, and crystal-clear mental clarity.  I was also surprised to find that the same dosage was just as effective at day 28 as it was at day 1.  Presently, I take approximately 3g of Kratom powder twice a day.  I usually skip at least one weekend day, and occasionally take a week off just to make sure I'm not building a tolerance.  I have experienced ZERO withdrawal symptoms during these times.\n\nBut Kratom might provide more than safe, effective, and only mildly addictive pain relief.  People claim that Kratom has antidepressant or antianxiety properties.  I'm not sure whether that's the case, but I can see how there might be sort of placebo effect.  For example, imagine after living with constant pain for years.  Now, imagine being able to sleep a full night through without waking up in pain.  Imagine being able to twist on the toilet seat to wipe properly without pain.  Imagine being able to wash your feet in the shower without pain.  Imagine being able to cook, clean, fold laundry - without pain.  Imagine being able to sit down at a computer and type a letter without pain.  I personally feel a lot better simply because I can do these things; my self-confidence has improved.  Others claim Kratom can be used to recover from opiate addiction.  While I wouldn't consider myself an opiate addict, I can see some validity to those claims as well.  And frankly, this country needs some better options - the costs in medical care and life due to the present opiate epidemic are staggering.  50000 people a year, and billions of dollars for medical care.  What we have now is not working.\n\nDon't ignore input from the scientific community and public.  Don't let media hype and ignorance confuse the facts.  Don't ban a substance that helps thousands cope with pain because a few mixed Kratom with other drugs and died.  Don't pretend 15 deaths in two years represents an emergency when more die from heroin DAILY.  I'm no hero - I wasn't injured serving in the military, or fighting a fire, or apprehending a violent criminal.  Don't turn your back on those people by making them criminals for combating the pain that is their reward for fighting FOR us.  I have seen firsthand the horrors caused by opiate addiction - If there is an option to help those people don't make it illegal; don't condemn thousands of people and their families to a slow spiral into addiction.  Don't make ME turn to illegal sources to effectively address my pain.\n\nWhen 50+ members of Congress and 100,000+ American citizens can agree that the DEA is acting out of line, maybe it's time to step back, reevaluate, and take a different approach.  Oh sure, I know it's technically legal to ban a substance without consulting anyone, but that doesn't make it right.\n\nDo the right thing here.

I have used kratom with very positive effects and would not like to lose this tool, this beneficial herbal supplement. I have used kratom once daily for the larger portion of several years with the effect of improved mood, focus, and energy. To ensure that I am not dependent on it, I periodically stop for a few weeks. At these times, while no longer receiving its benefits, I do not feel any physical withdrawal effects whatsoever.  Rather than having any harmful effects from its use I have experienced quite the contrary: the psychological benefits have allowed me to make better choices in my life and for my health, and a recent physical examination has shown be to be in better health than I have been in years.  I am gainfully employed as a repairman and have been at my present job for six years. I have been periodically recognized for excellence in my work, and also do charitable activities: I am a good, taxpaying citizen.\nI have taken the time to write not so much on my behalf but on that of some coworkers who  absolutely rely on kratom to manage chronic pain. In both cases their doctors prescribed opioid pain relievers to be taken regularly, but these drugs impaired them so much mentally that they were unable to work on a steady basis. They had to chose between severe pain or unemployment. The first gentleman read about kratom on the internet and found it highly effective. He now no longer requires opioid prescriptions. He later informed his other coworker, and this second gentleman was able to greatly reduce his reliance on prescription painkillers. \n\nFrom my personal experience I have found kratom to be a highly beneficial, non-addictive herb with no discernible side effects.  I am certain that restricting it would only harm a number of vulnerable persons, particularly those with limited access to health care. I am certain that restricting kratom would immediately cause a significant increase in use of opioids, both legal and illegal.  As the mission of your department is to protect the good of the public, I strongly urge that the compounds in the plant commonly known as kratom are not scheduled.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20248","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremiah Ventry Mcgee","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Art Richard, I'm am 61 years old who don't have any pain, and was never an addict - I have suffered though with anxiety, and low grade depression or a majority of my life.

The narcotics and the Lyrica were disasters- my body became addicted and I went through horrendous withdrawals for months (18 months for Lyrica!) trying to stop taking these medications. Intravenous drugs gave extremely short term relief, but living with a PICC line long term is neither safe nor practical. Medical marijuana is effective but puts me to sleep, so it still doesn't allow me to live a normal life.

It doesn't put me in an alternate state like pot and it's safe. \n\nIf marijuana is legal than Kratom should be too.  It's much more innocuous and therapeutic for pain patients.  Please consider Kratom carefully and make sure you have all your facts before making a decision that will affect many of us chronic pain sufferers.\n\nThank you,\nKristine Albert","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7928","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristine Albert","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've been a butcher for over 17 years and kratom has helped me so very much!.

I'm a full-time writer, and I can't do my job when I am feeling any of those things. When I was young, my mother became very addicted to prescription drugs she was legally prescribed, and it ruined our lives. Because of this, I have avoided the medications that doctors have tried to prescribe me for my different ailments because they are basically the same ones I watched my mother-- a very healthy, happy woman before she was prescribed-- deteriorate into a shell of herself while taking. I tried marijuana but found it mostly increased my anxiety (or made me just want to eat snacks and watch TV, haha). \n\nDiscovering Kratom was one of the best things that has happened to me. I use it as needed, and it has greatly improved my life. I used to lose days every month to pain, depression and anxiety, and Kratom has given them back to me. I love that it is a natural alternative to prescription drugs, that I can control my dosages since every day is different for me, and I don't feel totally crazy if I don't take it every day. It doesn't make me feel totally out of it or change my personality, and I can work normally while taking it.\n\nWhile I support more studies and research, I beg of you to not to ban Kratom. There is no research to back up such a heavy ban, and nearly all Kratom emergencies have been when users are mixing it with other drugs. There are many, many people out here who benefit from responsible use of Kratom. We're normal people living productive lives with jobs and families and participating in our community. We're just like you, and we're just trying to manage our issues in the best way we can. Please think of us. \n\nThank you for your time, and happy holidays.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20594","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Marissa Ross","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has literally saved my life and my marriage.  I am a recovering addict who has been in the recovery program for 8 years.  Benzos and opiods were my drug of choice.  I suffer from chronic neck and back pain along with crippling anxiety.  After going to a 90 day treatment facility I was thrown back into the world with no real solution for the very real pain and anxiety that I was constantly dealing with.  An AA friend of mine told me about kratom and suggested that I try it out.  What a God send.  Kratom eliminated my neck and back pain and eased my anxiety problems.  \n\nI've been on Kratom for a little over 8 years now.  In those 8 years I have not touched an opiod or a benzo.  Before finding kratom I was about to lose my marriage, my kids, my job, my family, but now all those things are in the best shape they have ever been in.  Every year during lent I give up Kratom for 40 days and have never had any difficulty in doing so.  There is no way I would have been able to give up opiods or benzos cold turkey.  Heck trying that with benzos can literally kill you.\n\nShould there be regulation?  Yes, there should.  Age related restrictions as well as regulations concerning proper labeling of ingredients to help curb adulterating products are reasonable restrictions.  An outright ban on the substance would be disastrous for countless Americans.  I know that I am not along.  There are hundreds of thousands of citizens who would proudly say that this plant has improved their quality of life.  People who use kratom do not go around burglarizing houses to pay for the drug.  Instead, they are people like you and me.  Doctors, lawyers, grandparents, parents, teachers...the list goes on.  \n\nI take issue with the DEA statement concerning kratom related deaths.  Kratom does not suppress breathing, so \"overdosing\" from the substance seems highly unlikely.  Further, 14 out of the 15 deaths cited by the initial Notice of Intent involved overdoses related to poly drug use. I would imagine that a closer look at the cause of death for the other person would rule out Kratom as being the cause of death.  The reason is that Kratom has a built in mechanism to prevent taking too much.  If you take too much you will throw up.  \n\nI also take issue with the DEA statement related to the effects of kratom ingestion.  Kratom does not produce hallucinations, paranoia or other similar effects.  In fact, the effects of kratom are so mild that most would not bother with the substance if their mission was to \"get high.\"  Pain-relief, anxiety relief and a mild feeling of well-being are the effects of kratom use. \n\nI'm begging you to not to make a knee-jerk reaction and ban the one plant that has helped keep me sober and pain free for 8 years.  Please do not place Kratom into Schedule I!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2975","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI write this comment to the fine public servants of the DEA to express my support of keeping Kratom (Mitragyna Speciosa) off of the list of scheduled and controlled drugs. I am a 32 year old male who makes an honest living in the world of online marketing/branding, as well as a taxpayer, son, brother, uncle and productive member of society. I discovered this wonderful plant in 2009 as I was seeking natural relief for severe depression and anxiety. I chose and continue to choose Kratom over pharmaceutical options as I have people who are very close to me who have struggled mightily with the side effects that often accompany the pharmaceutical drugs that are commonly prescribed for my condition.\n\nKratom affords me the ability to push past the often debilitating effects of depression/anxiety, allowing me to continue my pursuit of the American dream we all crave and strive for on a daily basis. My biggest concern should the DEA remove this plant from it's current legal status is not for myself, as I have found a way to survive before Kratom and will, in the worst case scenario that it gets scheduled, continue to survive. My concern is for the many other people who may be forced back into the world of potentially addictive and harmful pharmaceuticals or worse the many dangerous drugs that are available to people on the illicit black market.\n\nI sincerely hope that my message and the messages of thousands of other responsible law abiding and hopeful Americans does not fall on deaf ears.\n\nThank you for all the hard work you do on a daily basis at the DEA, and I hope for you a joyous and healthy holiday season.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16972","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Thomas Terranova","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to express my personal experiences using Kratom.

I am a 32 year old female living in Boston, MA. I work at Boston University as a Research Technician in the Anatomy and Neurobiology department in the laboratory for cognitive neurosciences. I recently received my Masters of Science in Biotechnology from Harvard University. I take Kratom daily as a dietary supplement. It helps with my depression. With Kratom I have the motivation to accomplish daily tasks that I otherwise let build up. Kratom acts similar to coffee and gives me a better outlook on life with a feeling of well being. I am focused, productive, and sociable at work. I feel like a productive member of society. I do not in any way feel \"high\" or out of control. Nor do I find this plant to be addicting. I can go days to months without it and wouldn't even notice. I believe this plant would be beneficial for those who suffer from opiate addiction, since it is impossible to overdose from it and can safely be substituted for fatal drugs. In the past I have had a terrible addiction to adderall after abusing my prescription for many years. Luckily, I have recovered from that stage of my life, but during stressful times I would find myself seeking adderall, which is certainly not a good thing. When reviewing my life with kratom (which has been over a year) to comment on its behalf, I noticed I have not once wanted or seeked out adderall since I've been supplementing Kratom in my OJ. The thought of knowing I could have easily gotten  adderall, but did not want it felt so powerful for me! I felt happy knowing how strong I have been. It would be a shame to take away such a beneficial plant. I would much rather take a natural supplement than be on prescription medications because there are too many negative side effects with the latter and none for the former. I thank you kindly for listening to me! Please don't put this plant as a schedule 1 narcotic it is helping so many people and it would be detrimental to them. \nSincerely,\nRebecca Smith","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11765","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Rebecca Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I oppose adding kratom to any drug schedule.

I am a 43 year old mother & grandmother who suffers from SEVERE fibromyalgia and works full-time at our towns largest bank where I am on my feet for 9 hours every day. Before Kratom, I was close to bedridden, close to losing my job due to missing so much work. I missed so many family functions, missed making memories with the kids, missed out on LIFE. I WAS SEVERELY depressed and almost suicidal.\nMy thoughts on the DEA's threat to making Kratom a schedule 1 drug are they would be doing the economy more harm than good. Many people like me would be out of work, due to not being able to function. More people will be going on disability or state assistance. \nKratom keeps hard working, responsible people like me able to hold full time jobs and we are able to function and think clearly and be more productive vs. laying in bed all day doped up on pills-which is where I was for YEARS. Kratom gave me my life back. I can work all day, cook a meal and play with my grandkids. I can LIVE. My chronic pain had me bedridden for so long. I heard about Kratom about 6 months ago in one of my fibromyalgia online support groups. Many fellow fibomites had success with it, so I decided to give it a try and I have never been able to live like this again on over 15 years! I never dreamed it was possible. All my friends and family noticed a HUGE difference right away. I recently was able to plan my daughters wedding, something I never could have done before. (I even danced!) There are still so many things I want to do! I am planning on baking for Christmas again this year ( something I haven done in years) And I donate platters of baked goods to the local shelters, senior centers, and churches. \nI beg you, please don't take my life away from me, and the thousands out there like me.

I'm a carpenter and eat it to ease the aches and pains of physical work. When using, I experience a boost of energy, and an elevated mood. In the past, I used caffeine and cigarettes to try to regulate these aspects of life much to the detriment of my body. Upon receiving news that the DEA was scheduling Kratom, I was very troubled that this benign leaf was the target of government regulation and not substances like opiates that are claiming tens of thousands of lives. Just like anything else, people can get hooked on Kratom. When I started tapering my use because of the ban, I went through unpleasant withdrawal symptoms similar to that of a cold. Obviously, more research needs to happen to better understand the alkaloids found in kratom and how these things affect people. I recognize how tricky this situation must be for government and I appreciate the effort being made to protect the populace. However, I really believe kratom is not putting anyone in danger. The plant has a built-in governor that makes abuse rather undesirable. Taking too much gives you a tummy ache and heavy eyelids while taking too much of a pain management substitute like Vicadin will shut down a respiratory system. For me, this is a civil rights issue. A free child of God must be able to determine for his or herself whether ingesting a natural occurring medicine is beneficial or not to their personal situation and needs. Please don't schedule it because of Big Pharma pressure. These demons don't have the public's interest in mind, you know that.

I'm staunchly opposed to the DEA putting Kratom on the list of schedule 1 controlled substances because it has been instrumental in providing me relief for the neurological disease I was born with called RLS. I've tried as many homeopathic solutions I could find to no avail. My doctor's solution is to prescribe opiates of which I have zero desire to start because of the addictive nature associated with opiates. I found Kratom many years years ago, and it provided instant relief from the nightly insomnia and discomfort associated with my disease. I've never encountered any side effects from Kratom, and it has literally been a life saver for me. Kratom has saved/changed my life for the better, and has provided relief from an ailment that has plagued me since my earliest memories. Anyone who has actually used Kratom would realize it's benefits versus the addictive qualities of pharmaceuticals that the medical industry attempts to push on us. I believe that scheduling Kratom as a scheduled one drug and eliminating the option for people to use a natural substance versus a pharmaceutical drug would only contribute to the existing problem of addiction. I hope our voices are heard.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nLeo J.

I have finally received the proper care through workmans comp but unfortunately have been progressive in sustaining nerve damage to my sciatic nerve on my right leg from an L4/L5 herniation.   The pain at times is unbearable, thankfully my tear filled prayers to God were answered when I saw a friend \"liked\" the AKA (American Kratom Association) ... after a full sleepless night's research I placed my first order--I have continued looking in to Kratom's safety by sourcing accurate information and reading many first hand accounts through a facebook group where people w worse conditions who take Kratom supplemenatally find significant improvement of liver panel tests and other blood work (like sugar levels etc) .  Kratom helps me have a better life and makes it possible for me to perform my exercises for my Phsical Therapy program.  Kratom doesn't have the negative side affects of prescribed pain medication as it is a safe and natural alternative that people use in place of pills for pain, depression, anxiety, PTSD and many other chronic conditions.  \n\nThe last three to five years of my life have been less than amazing as the cycle of pain and what to do to deal with it eventually leaves you sedated and immobile.

Placing Kratom as a schedule one substance shows the: lack of proper information, collusion between governmental agencies who are lobbied by larger pharmaceutical companies.  Kratom is the solution to the opiate and opium derived opioid pills that have ravaged suburban America.  Please don't ignore our request to keep this life saving and health improving plant legal.

First, I will tell you a little about myself and how I started taking Kratom.  For years I have tried to just \"deal\" with my anxiety/depression.  I would have anxiety attacks while at work (I work in the medical field as a Respiratory Therapist), driving in the car, at home, and I don't know exactly why this would happen.  It took me every last effort to not go to the doctors for my anxiety, because I did not want to be on medication for it.   I finally broke down, went to the doctors, and ended up being prescribed Zoloft.  I took the medication for about 4-5 months because I was told it would take a few weeks to start to \"work\".  I hated the way Zoloft made me feel.  I felt like I wasn't myself and I completely lost my appetite while taking this medication.  I ended up slowly weaning myself off  Zoloft, because my anxiety was still there.  I then started looking into more natural remedies to reduce my anxiety issues.  I was first introduced to kratom from a friend who suffered from severe social anxiety.  He knew that I also suffered from anxiety and depression.  I did alot of research online and became a member  of several kratom groups.  It took me some time to figure out how much of this natural plant to take, but when I did, I began to notice that my anxiety became less and less of an issue.  I feel like my quality of life has improved tremendously from this plant!  I am the type of person who looks for natural herbs and supplements to help with any ailments.  Kratom has also helped to minimize my knee and back pain (just everyday aches and pains from work, etc).  I believe it would be a terrible decision to make Kratom a Schedule I substance.  I have read so many success stories, that honestly brought happy tears to my eyes!  How people's lives have improved greatly because of Kratom.  I hope the DEA will see this too and not take away this natural plant.  This plant is not a drug and I am not addicted to it whatsoever.  I take kratom and other natural herbs as needed.  This plant should be available to have more research done on it, and I hope that will happen.

I started using Kratom a year and a half ago after struggling greatly from an opiate addiction for several years after hurting my back from a training accident. I was put on opiates for the pain for almost a year and then was abruptly cut off and ended up seeking it out on my own to help ease the pain and also for fear of withdrawal. I needed to get my life back together and quit even if it meant being in pain. I came across a few videos mentioning how Kratom was a natural pain reliever that helped greatly and didn't make one feel sluggish or \"zombie\" like, like opiates can do, and without all the negative aspects of opiate addiction. I then ordered some Kratom from a vendor online and gave it a try. I took the Kratom without any opiates and to my surprise I had great pain relief and I never got negative withdrawal effects from stopping my use of opiates abruptly. I never felt zombie like from the Kratom and I quickly started to get my life back. Now every so often and every couple of days when my back is really bothering me I can take a little Kratom and got to work and be productive thought my day. I feel fortunate that I can take something natural to help me with my life rather than depend on dangerous pharmaceutical drugs. \nI believe Kratom should remain legal and accessible due to the fact that it helps so many people overcome several issues and aspects in their life. Kratom by itself has little to no evidence of being dangerous or hazardous to any individuals. I believe it is up to the people to decide whether or not they can use Kratom or not. There are currently several dangerous things out there that are legal and actually killing hundreds of thousands of people (alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals) yet it is left up to the individual. At the very least Kratom deserves more conclusive scientific research to understand it's benifits and/or negative aspects before being thrown into a schedule 1 drug where research will be nearly impossible. Outlawing something that does so much good for so many people will do way more harm than good. If the DEA is worried about kids taking it just to \"feel good\" then a simple age restriction could be inforced just as tobacco and alcohol are. But ultimately it should be left up to an adult whether or not Kratom is something they want to try. \nIn conclusion I say to the DEA, if the people's well being is truly what you are after, then please rethink about banning a natural plant that has helped so many people. Thank you for taking the time to open up a comment period and for reading what I had to say.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20982","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Rhodes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems o","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17692","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Darren Mitton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Good Afternoon and thank you for hearing our stories.

Kratom does not meet that (unlike alcohol and tobacco.)\n\nIn fact, Kratom seems like a solution to a number of issues, including various forms of drug addiction and chronic pain. Plus, it can perform the pain-killing work of morphine without dangerously depressing breathing -- the way opioids do.\n\nHere's how Kratom works...\nIt uses a pathway that mediates many of the undesirable effects of traditional opioids such as constipation, respiratory depression. In fact, this knowledge is spurring additional research by pharmaceutical companies.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8UTI6\n\nAbout Kratom, a leading researcher notes...\nThailand is considering legalizing kratom as a safer alternative for meth addicts. U.S. researchers are trying to study its potential to help opiate abusers kick the habit without withdrawal side effects.\nhttp://bit.ly/2c8SI7v\n\nThere are anecdotal reports of addiction risk. But it appears the addiction can be broken without withdrawal symptoms. Meanwhile, the painkillers currently being used are more addictive, dangerous, and harder to kick. Yet...\n\nThe FDA and DEA both appear ready to ban kratom and effectively kill research to further develop this substance. Is the DEA is running cover for a Big Pharma company that wants to monopolize kratom?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15442","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"J Kelley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've researched, and from everything I've read and heard Kratom is a natural, beneficial product that should be legal to all.

I drank Kratom tea when I had just turned eighteen, and it helped tremendously. No, I did not use it to get \"high\", I used it to better myself as a human, to broaden my understanding of the earth and what it gives us, and to treat my terrible mental disorder of crippling depression. I felt a rise of good mood, empathy toward my friends, and an awareness as if I just woke up from a fantastic night sleep. Kratom can not only help with depression and anxiety, it can help opiate addicts get back on their feet and live life. Scheduling Kratom would be absolutely foolish. It is a plant. It helped me.

Kratom alleviate the pain and I was able to  get off my prescription medications. The prescription medications made me feel very drowsy,dry mouth, and I couldn't function and take care of my family. The pain medication stop working because I was actually taking the medication because my body craved it I had to keep taking more and more prescription medication to feel some relief from the pain. I laid in bed all the time because I was tired, hurting,  and just didn't have the quality of life that I wanted. I was skeptical when I was introduced to Kratom but when I started taking it I found relief in my pain, I was not tired, I had the quality of life that I dreamed without pain.  Kratom saved my life I was able to take kratom and function normally. Kratom doesn't give you a high, it doesn't give you euphoria where prescription drugs do all that. Please don't take our Kratom away there are so many people including me that are in need of pain relief and this helps without prescription medications and the high cost of them. Please ,please I beg that you rethink of banning kratom.

It began in my lower back, most like due to back labor, but quickly soread throughout my body. I was using walls to get 10ft. to the bathroom. This was only the beginning of it too. The beginning of my journey entailed fighting expired insurance, no insurance, not the right insurance. I spent roughly two years just trying to get properly looked at and remained  hopeful to receive a diagnosis.  Throughout these years my pain worsened.  I was eventually told i had degenerative disc disease, buldging discs, herniated discs, tares in my hip musclss (that would heal then come back), sciatica in both hips and fibromyalgia. ALL the meds, it seemed endless. The Motrin 800's had worn on me some  badly that if i took one i would become immediately sick and vomit. The lyrica sent me into convulsive vomiting spells, the cymbalta made me unable to stand up straight (i felt as if i was in a cloud and it did not stop umtil i took myself off of it). The doctors told me to keep taking all this \"stuff\" even after explaining the wretched side effects. All this madness of perscriptions and my pain was still there! I was always at a pain level of at least 5. What's the point if it's not helping? I saw specialists and they thought the injection route should help. Nope, only made it worse. I was lost. LOST.....Then my boyfriend (who suffers many similar pain issues, severe anxiety/panic and is a recovered (recovering) addict) and we had heard about something called kratom. Did some extensive research and decided it was worth a shot. I work on both sides of the fence, with Md's and Holstic doctors. I believe they are a perfect example of Yin and Yang. We tried a few different kinds specific to our individual needs and for the first time in years i/we had real honest pain relief! It was relief and virtually ZERO side effects. Knowing what kind and your dosage is key. Making sure your supplier is legitimate is maybe the most important factor. That is how it is with anything medicinal. Kratom has changed my life...for the better. I can function without worry of side effects or excruciating pain haunting me. Moderation is the secret. It usually is with anything nyou take and can abuse. My boyfriend, my partener, the love of my life, my best friend and soul mate has become the man he has always thought he could be. He has pulled himself from the depths of hell clean and sober all because of this plant. This gift. He is amazing, always has been to me but now he sees himself as i always have. He never thought he would be free from perscriptions, from their death grip but with kratom,the desire for better, a stong mind and stronger will, other natural help he is living the live he's always deserved. If kratom is taken from us.....i cannot imagine what will happen. We will shrivel back into our broken bodies and withdraw from our very functional  lives, our children, our happiness, our fight for better, our dreams, our plans, and our desire to keep fighting. We've tried it all, researched everything, done our homework and then some. We have seen so many people flourish with the use of kratom. They go to their hard labor jobs and go back,the next day. I've witnessed addicts get clean and stay clean. I've wintnessed so many positive outcomes from kratom and taking it away will almost instantly destroy people's lives and not only will they suffer, their families will suffer, their loved ones and friends will all be adversely affected. This could be the end of a newly revamped live for so many people. Tragic. Please don't take away all that so many have overcome.  I am kratom, together we are kratom!

I am active in my community, I pay my bills, am law abiding, and in general a functional adult. In no way does kratom interfere with my daily functioning, on the contrary, it greatly improves my quality of life. Without Kratom as an alternative, I may be forced to go the route of other painkillers, which carry a greater risk of side effects and addiction. In fact, kratom has been known to be indispensable to a great number of recovering opiate addicts. PTSD sufferers, including our veterans, can also use kratom as a supplemental aid in controlling anxiety and flashbacks, and have experienced this in my own journey. It's my belief, based on all the people I know and the community we have formed in the process of answering this action, that scheduling this supplement would actually have a negative effect on public health. Kratom is a great way to avoid costly, risky, potentially addictive drugs and still maintain quality of life. \n\nMost if not all of the overdoses in which kratom was referenced involved a number of other illicit drugs that truthfully should be used to combined with anything. This does not represent the large majority of those who rely on kratom to maintain their quality of life.

I work full time in finance, am a single mom to a beautiful daughter, I write novels in my \"spare\" time, and I was diagnosed with MS about 6 years ago. Many prescriptions and unsuccessful in the long term surgeries later, I found this supplement. It hasn't cured my MS, but it does make my pain manageable without the use of pharmaceuticals. I'm very active on days when I'm not in debilitating pain; I hike the mountains, I take long walks daily, and I no longer need 6-10 pills a day to just function. Not that the pills were helping me do that very well. I've been taking this herbal supplement for about 4 months, and while it doesn't completely take my pain away, it does do a better job than my prescriptions did, without all the nasty side effects of the pills and patches they had me on. I'm not a drug addict or an alcoholic, but I will be dependent on something the rest of my life, so the Dr.s have told me. Being in pain daily to such extremes that I can't even get out of bed isn't an option for me. I didn't know before that there was an herbal option that I could supplement with diet and excercise. Kratom isn't a drug, nor should it be classified as such. My pain pills made me \"high,\" kratom does not. When I drink my kratom tea, I feel normal, and able to go about my day without medicine or debilitating pain. Unlike my pain pills, kratom just allows me to live my life, and be the best mom, and the best employee I can be. \n\nPlease don't ban Kratom. This supplement has been a godsend for so many, including myself. As I said before, it doesn't cure anything. But it does help me tremendously as a supplement to my healthy living practices. I'm an adult born and raised in the land of the free. Please allow me to be free to make my own choices in what I put into my body. There are true wars on drugs in this country, and this isn't one of them. \n\nThank you.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13259","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Day","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear interested parties of the DEA,\nAs a citizen of these United States, I wish to go on record to urge you to preserve the legal status of kratom.

I felt the force of its effects in my left thigh in particular.  Although frequently varying my position from sitting to standing and back again offered some relief, as a grant writer for a nonprofit organization, I needed to be able to sit in front of my computer writing for long periods of time.  Despite embarking on a series of shots that doctors hoped would relieve the pain, I remained in pain.  My search for relief revealed that extensive rest would likely help, and in March 2014, at the age of 62, I took early retirement. \n \nAbout this time, my husband discovered kratom when he was searching for a way to reduce his caffeine intake.  He read an article in Fortune magazine by a man who had initially planned to criticize kratom but decided to try it first.  He found it to be effective and instead wrote positively about the ways in which it had helped him.\nMy husband advised me to try kratom to help reduce residual sciatica pain, as well as anxiety.  To my surprise, it was very effective.  I began taking kratom in powder form in herbal tea each morning, and it helped reduce both sciatica discomfort and anxiety.  It also assisted with arthritis symptoms in my fingers and hands.  When my former employer asked me to serve as a consultant, I did so for two months and found that I was fully functional again.  In October 2014, I returned to full-time employment with my previous employer.  I am now well able to handle a highly responsible position and a daily round-trip commute of about 3 hours.  I believe kratom has played a key role in my ability to return to work and thrive in a position that daily presents many challenges and deadlines. \nAfter taking kratom for about 2.5 years, I learned that the sale of kratom was expected to be curtailed at the end of September 2016. I began gradually reducing the amount (1 to 1.5 teaspoons a day) that I put in herb tea each morning.  I experienced no problems in stopping the use of kratom.  I did find soreness returning in the area affected by sciatica, however, along with arthritis pain in my hands and fingers.  In addition, I observed that my general sense of well-being decreased.\n\nI was glad to learn that a comment period had been granted during which kratom would still be available.  I resumed taking kratom and have found that 0.75 teaspoons per day is sufficient.  The sciatica discomfort is gone, and the arthritis pain in my fingers and hands is controlled.  I appreciate kratom because it is a natural substance that does not subject my system to the side effects that many pharmaceuticals do.  My energy level is good with it, and I do not experience any of the ill effects, such as malaise, that are common with pain medications. \n \nMy husband has several health issues that kratom helps tremendously. In fact, using kratom returns him to normalcy.  It is a joy for us to be able to go out together even on a simple excursion to Walmart and not have to find a place where he can sit and wait while I shop because muscle pain has overtaken him during the walk from the parking lot to the inside of the building.  He also deals with stomach issues similar to acid reflux, and kratom enables him to eat normally without pain.  \nI believe that kratom is a natural substance that should be available on the market for those who wish to use it.  My husband and I first began to explore natural remedies many years ago during a period when we had no health insurance.  We became very grateful for the availability of items in nature that were able to help us with few or no side effects.  Kratom is a natural substance that can reduce pain without adverse side effects and can be purchased at a cost that is affordable for many.  We believe it should remain available for purchase. Thank you for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nPatrice Zahry","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21018","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Patrice Zahry","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am opposed to banning Kratom.

I am a 47 yr old and have fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue and arthritis.  At the onset of my illness 8 yrs ago I was mostly bed ridden.  I was at my Dr. office often begging for some type of relief from chronic pain and exhaustion and before I knew it I was prescribed and taking over 400 pills a month and felt worse every day.    Almost 3 years ago I heard about KRATOM from a friend on a fibro support group and started researching everything I could find. I ordered some kratom from a vetted vendor in the U.S.A. that provided testing results to make sure there was nothing added to the kratom leaf and tried 1 tsp of the powdered leaf and for the first time in years I had pain relief.  If I was not able to take kratom, I would not be able to get out of bed many days let alone help raise my 4 yr old granddaughter.  Kratom has given me my life back . I'm no longer taking hundreds of pills , I'm able to enjoy taking a walk down my street or be able to play barbies and even ride my bike .  Before I found kratom I was not able to participate in living my life, even the simple things like going to the store or going to church.  My life was so bleak being bound to my bag of prescription bottles, 1 medication would cause so many side effects that before I knew it I had 10 medicine bottles.  I sincerely ask you to consider to allow me the freedom to take charge of my health by keeping kratom off this schedule.. Thank you for allowing my to write my story about how KRATOM has given me my life back and has given my family back the \"pre-chronic pain\"woman I was before fibromyalgia .

He advised all of his friends that the best things they could do for their health were to buy neti pots to rinse their sinuses and also to drink calming kratom tea, which had a bitter taste but really helped put him into a ''better frame of mind.'' I tried it and found it helped my anxiety. I have severe PTSD  from childhood abuse, surviving rape as an adolescent and a an assault and carjacking as an adult. I have TBI and a degenerative disc disease. I have been a social worker since 1992. I first realized a possible therapeutic usage beyond anxiety when a couple of neighbors were struggling to rid themselves of opiate addiction. They were in withdrawal and were trying to muster up some energy to ''go get well'' which meant for them purchasing and using opiates. I gave each of them some kratom tincture. The woman, Nema, said ''huh'' and sat back down. She then said that she knew she was in withdrawal but she no longer felt the urge to go and get more drugs. Methadone, suboxen, these are just legal opiate clinics with longer periods of withdrawal than heroin. Kratom is a gentle and easy answer to the opiate epidemic simply because while it relieves pain and withdrawal symptoms, KRATOM DOES NOT LOWER RESPIRATIONS WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES OPIATE ADDICTS TO GO INTO RESPIRATORY DISTRESS AND DIE. Kratom is less harmful than tylenol which causes liver damage. It has been used for thousands of years. Opiate addicts have found out about Kratom and found freedom from fear. Don't ruin the solution. The government should not create more desperation and misery for its constituents. I work, vote, pay taxes and bills. I am a law abiding member of society with chronic pain and anxiety. Kratom helps me.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1919","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lisa Craddock","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As Dec 1st is fast approaching, I felt it necessary to express my concerns regarding the DEA intent to make Kratom a schedule 1 drug along with heroin, cocaine, Marijuana, and Methamphetamine. This decision will end up causing far more harm than good. \nThe decision is based on the assumption that this herb poses an imminent threat to public health do to 660 emergency room visits and 15 deaths in the last 3 years solely attributed to the consumption of an herb used for hundreds, if not thousands of years by the indigenous people in Southeast Asia.   \nI have used this herb for over 6 years and I can tell you from my experience it is not possible to overdose on pure Kratom alone.  In those cases sited, I suspect other far more dangerous drugs had been consumed, either by unscrupulous vendors mixing Kratom with other synthetic Opioids, or consuming drugs along with Kratom. The reputable vendors verify the purity of their product. I have been ordering this herb from one vendor for the last 4 years and have never received anything but pure leaf without any additives. Reputable vendors maintain tight quality control on the product because they know their business depends on it.\nThe pure leaf powder cannot cause an overdose, as it does not cause respiratory depression like Opioids. It is true that long term use can result in addiction for some people. As with any therapeutic substance, there will always be a small percentage that will. However, this plant is benign by comparison to other harder more addictive legal and illegal substances. Alcohol alone is responsible for more deaths in one day than the claimed 15 death attributed to Kratom in 3 years, not to mention the thousands of hospital visits and deaths resulting from legal narcotics.\nKratom is certainly is no party drug. You do not get high, and I have had several people claim it did nothing for them at all. I guess everyones chemistry varies. The people who use Kratom daily range from mid 30s to 70s. We are responsible hard working patriotic tax paying citizens of a supposedly free country. I myself am 58 years old and have made a successful career providing training for soldiers in simulated combat scenarios. I am proud to support men and woman of the military and consider the skills they learn from this training will save lives on the battlefield. \nMy story is similar to others. Prior to discovering Kratom, I spent a lifetime dealing with severe depression and anxiety that eventually led to self-medicating with Alcohol. The doctor put me on SSRI antidepressants that did help somewhat, but the depression and anxiety lingered effecting my marriage and Job. If this is such a dangerous substance, why are long term users productive members of society? \nPlease reconsider this decision and listen to the hundreds of thousands of Kratom users who have found this natural plant medicine to be a life saver. We are productive and contributing members of society that feel we should have the freedom to choose what we put into our own bodies without becoming felons. I have never heard anyone say I have been taking Heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine for 6 years and it has changed my life for the better.\n Hopefully, you have taken to heart all the testimonials that reveal we are not strung out junkies destroying our families, losing our jobs, or causing any other harm to society. I urge you to carefully consider the consequences of making this plant a controlled substance and the effect it will have on the citizens that depend on it.\nSincerely,","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6695","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has assisted me in managing chronic pain.

I have never been an illegal drug user or had any addiction issues.  I suffer from chronic pain and inflammatory issues due to several chronic, diagnosed health conditions.  My doctors in the past have attempted to prescribe hydrocodone and oxycodone to me for the pain.  I will not take either, as both medications make me feel extremely nauseated and tired, and I cannot function in my day-to-day life while taking them.  I also hesitate to take any medication which is highly addictive, as I am just generally opposed to this concept.  Three years ago a friend saw me suffering and told me about kratom.  I immediately began to research this plant, and what I found was encouraging.  I placed an order for a package of kratom powder, and I began taking 1/4 a teaspoon each morning with a tall glass of water.  My chronic neck and shoulder pain did not go away, but the pain is lessened by about 50% due to this amazing plant.  In addition, the cysts and lesions caused by my inflammatory skin condition, hidradenitis suppurativa, are much more bearable.  Many individuals with this condition end up addicted to narcotic pain relievers - I refuse to allow that to happen to me. I can live a normal life thanks to this plant.\n\nI have read articles suggesting kratom is addictive and that it causes some sort of \"high.\" I can assure you from my own experience that neither is remotely true.  There is no loopy feeling, no high, no hallucinating, nothing, with the ingestion of kratom.  There is a mild to moderate lessening of pain, and even a lessening of anxiety, but nothing resembling a high.  It does not render the user incapable of functioning, of working, of driving.  Regarding its addictive properties, I will say that I have taken kratom one to two times a day for several years.  When we go on vacation, however, I do not bring it. I can go from taking it daily to skipping a week and feel no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever.  I end up taking Tylenol or Advil because I find myself hurting again - but I don't \"crave\" kratom when I miss doses.  Kratom is no more addictive than caffeine, and in my case even much less so.\n\nKratom is a plant which helps both people in pain, such as myself, and people attempting to end addictions to heroin and narcotic pain medication. It is not a problem - it is a solution for thousands of Americans.  Good people who simply want to live a life as free of pain, fatigue, and addiction as humanly possible. Banning this plant will harm many people and lead to an increase in deaths due to opiates - and we already have an epidemic on our hands as it is.  Please do not ban this natural product which helps so many people lead normal, productive lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1732","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Susan gilleland","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I hope your day is going amazing!

So for me I enjoy the light energy with a relaxing effect. I do feel like there's should be an age regulation to it cause I believe it comes with some responsibility. Such as I think coffee should for children sake cause it can be too strong. Just like someone could take too much coffee tylenol and aspirin.

It will do nothing to reduce the incarceration rates of non-violent people found guilty of possessing a substance that the DEA has determined to be problematic. And, it will do nothing to protect and serve our citizens.  What it will do is create a black market demand for a substance that will no doubt be filled by violent organizations that care nothing for the public good and serve only profit.  Prohibition of all kinds leads to organized crime and the DEA is already done enough to aid violent criminals without adding another substance to their list of products they provide to society along with the subsequent ancillary violence and terror that is part and parcel to prohibition.

I strongly and unequivocally oppose the scheduling of the raw leaf material of the tree Mitragyna speciosa, Kratom, by the DEA.\n     I started using Kratom in late 2004 to combat nerve pain caused by a workplace accident in JAN 2001.  I was prescribed strong opiate painkillers by my neuro and orthopedic surgeons, soon finding that those legally prescribed opioids rapidly lost effectiveness and caused my doctors to increase my dose of these dangerous medicines.  These increasing dosages came with a whole host of side effects like dizziness, shallow breathing, lethargy, sleeplessness, extreme tiredness, depression, as well as both physical and mental withdrawal when I tried--with doctors' consent--to lower my dose.  I developed deep depression and feelings of helplessness from which there was only a very painful escape; to cease opiates entirely, suffer the withdrawals, and to live in severe pain.\n     My work life suffered, my personal relationships suffered, and my family suffered during the time that I was habituated, and effectively addicted, to legal pain medication.  I was less than half the man I used to be and not getting better.  I had the overwhelming feeling that a significant part of my problems stemmed from the opiates that my doctors continued to prescribe to me even though I told them of all the negative effects they were causing in my life.\n     Soon after that I noticed that more and more people were becoming addicted to these prescribed pain medications, that doctors who were illegally running 'pill mills' were being rightfully targeted and shut down, and that their former patients were turning to heroin and other drugs being sold on the street by unscrupulous dealers.  People I had known as good, productive members of society were turning into addicted felons because they had no systematic support system to fall back on to get out of the cycle of addiction.  I decided that I needed to find a way out of this dangerous cycle before I found myself on the street, suddenly released from the medical care of my doctors, trying to find relief for the pain and habituation I suffered daily.  I then found Kratom when researching ways to combat opiate addiction. \n     Kratom was legal so I bought some and tried it. I instantly noticed that I no longer needed opiate pain medication and that Kratom provided more relief than opiates with less side effects.  I also soon found out why Kratom leaf is virtually impossible to overdose on; it will cause one to purge one's stomach by vomiting if two doses are taken too close together.  Fifteen minutes after I accidentally took too much Kratom, I vomited the contents of my stomach, rested quietly for a few minutes, and returned to feeling normal while vowing to never again forget the time of my last dose.\n     I also very quickly found that I could easily take less and less Kratom without suffering the horribly debilitating withdrawal symptoms caused by trying to cut down on opiate consumption; it was immensely easier to wean myself from Kratom than my prescribed opiates!  Over the course of one month I reduced my opiate consumption to zero while also cutting my Kratom consumption by two thirds and I felt like I was given a new lease on life.  While I still had some pain and still ate a very small amount of Kratom leaf each day, I was able to recapture the vitality that I knew just a few years prior and noticed that I no longer got sick with a cold or ear ache or some other infection seemingly every month. To me, Kratom was a literal life saving plant.\n     Five years later I ceased all consumption of Kratom unless I did something that caused a flare up of nerve pain. I went many months at a time without consuming Kratom leaf and was able to take it for a couple days during a bad episode--ceasing use when not needed--without suffering withdrawals more severe than coffee withdrawal.  I've continued this cycle for the last twelve years, taking Kratom only as necessary and for only short periods with little to no withdrawal (and without ever missing work during those twelve years!).\n     When an acquaintance decided that she finally needed to get clean for her own health and for the benefit of her two children and husband, I told her about Kratom.  I gave her some, instructed her on the correct usage, and wished her well.  About six months later I received a Christmas card with a picture of her and her family on the front. In the card she wrote a note to me explaining how she was cured of her street pill and heroin habit by using Kratom and weaning herself off of Kratom over a period of two months.  \n     In summary, Kratom works, is safe, and is a light in the dark hole of opiate addiction currently gripping our great country.  Please do not make our situation worse by scheduling Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1596","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"We the people need to keep alternatives like kratom available to the public.

I got injured in 1990 skiing, and had a severe compression injury with ruptured discs, and fractures to my spine. Over the years I had back pain that would come and go, but in 2011 I had a car accident that brought my previous injury to the breaking point. After 2 major back operations and the loss of my job due to performance related to my back pain, I lost everything- my house, my savings, my stock accounts, and my cars. I have been selling everything I own on Ebay to get any funds to live on and have been waiting 30 months to date for my Social Security hearing with no health insurance. In FL I cant get any services for medical treatment like Medicaid, or anything for that matter. My doctor is through the county clinic, but they cant do specialist level care that I need, and can only prescribe a weak pain medicine that barely helps at all. \n\nI take kratom daily for pain, and have no way to get any medicines because of the fact I have no health insurance. I remain in chronic pain and with kratom my pain is under control if I take it and rest. If kratom is made to be illegal I will have the only means of pain control taken away, and I cant go back to the pain I had before I found kratom. Being in constant pain has also taken a toll on my mental state, and I suffer from extreme depression because of the constant pain. Kratom is the only relief I have found and I take it responsibly. Kratom works better for my pain relief than ANY prescription medications I have taken through this whole ordeal over the last 5 years.\nPlease let this plant remain legal so people such as myself with legitimate medical needs can take it, and feel better.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0718","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Eric Sherman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement kratom.

I refuse to start down the path of opiate pain management that is plaguing this country with a death every nineteen seconds. The rightful and wise decision to make is to allow the proper research on Kratom be conducted to determine whether it's actually harmful before any knee-jerk legislation takes place to effectively ban it in the US. I've read countless testimonies from people who say it's their miracle plant after searching so long for a relief. It's not chemically processed like cocaine, heroine,( even tobacco has chemicals) it's merely crushed leaves from a tree.

I have a history of Chronic Kidney Stones (2 or 3 per year) since I was 15 years old. I am now 46. I stumbled across Kratom over a year ago as I was looking for a safer alternative for pain relief. Every kidney stone I get, usually I am prescribed opiates to aid with the pain. All the opiates are definitely addictive and come with terrible withdrawal symptoms after taking them for a few weeks. I researched on my own and learned that Kratom relieves pain. While taking Kratom for pain relief of my kidney stones, I soon learned that it also helped with everyday aches and pains that I get from working a lot. I rather take Kratom then Motrin or other over the counter pain relief drugs. I believe that Kratom is a diuretic, which is great for me. It helps keeps my kidneys flushed out so kidney stones do not have time to form. Kratom helps a lot of good people with a plethera  of different  aliments. Making Kratom illegal would be a \"bully\" move and It would do a great deal of harm to folks that it helps.

I was surprised on how well my brain was working without feeling 'high' or 'buzzed' whatsoever. I bought some soon after, and enjoy taking it time to time but feel no need whatsoever to take it regularly. I prefer taking a small amount, because once I took too much which caused a slight stomach ache that was cured by eating some food. I have a really hard time calling it a drug, as its effects are much more related to the subtle effects of supplements. \nI gave some to a friend who has been on pain meds for months because of a surgery. She has been trying all sorts of different things to ween herself off the pain meds as she has become quite addicted, but hasnt found anything that works well.. Or if it does 'work' it makes her feel so mentally disabled that she cant function properly. She tried kratom and said it worked immediately. She was also surprised on how well her brain functioned while the kratom also relieved her pain . \nI know a few people who take kratom, all are functioning responsible active adults and kratom helps them with a myriad of issues.

I am 19 years old and work as a package handler at UPS. I am against the scheduling of Kratom. Kratom has helped me in many ways. I used to drink coffee to get energy, but then caffeine started to give me anxiety, shakes, and gastrointestinal problems. I then did some research online and found a plant in the same scientific family as the coffee bean, and that plant was Kratom. From the first time I tried it, it helped me just as much, or more, than coffee did. My job is very physically taxing, so after quitting coffee it became very hard to do my job. Kratom gave me the strength and motivation to do my job at UPS. Taking the plant did not mentally impair me. I retained my mental cognition just as one would after drinking a cup of coffee. The news of the ban really upset me. If Kratom was banned, I would have nothing to use to ever give me the extra energy I needed.

I workout A lot and am very serious about working out. I workout and that causes muscle soreness, and can cause injury. I play football and concussions as we as broken bones are common sport injuries for football players. That is why football players wear so much protection. I also play hockey and hockey players are constantly getting hit in the boards which can lead to broken bones, concussions, tooth loss, comas, and even death. I recently injured my heel, my foot, and my knee running A marathon. I have been using Kratom for almost three years, and one of the reasons I use Kratom is help me manage pain from injuries. Kratom is very affective, and has almost no side effects in my personal experience. Kratom is an herbal tea, not A drug. Kratom is very safe compared to over the counter pain medicine like acetaminophen and sugary energy drinks like monster and red bull. When you compare Kratom to tobacco and alcohol I am confident you will think that Kratom is safer to an extreme margin  People really do overdose from acetaminophen, alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine, but you can't overdose from Kratom. I am A very sporty person and Kratom is A herbal lifesaver. I feel so blessed to have Kratom, and live in A country where Kratom is legal, unregulated, and available. Kratom users don't use Kratom for A recreational high. Almost all of us are responsible adults over the age of thirty that use Kratom to help manage pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, et cetera. Some Americans work overtime at labor intensive jobs, and use Kratom to help them function at work not unlike coffee. I work 50 hours A week at A hot warehouse lifting boxes that can weigh more than 120 pounds. My challenging job makes me feel overworked, sweaty, sore, and stressed without kratom. When I use Kratom at work I feel joyful most of the time, happy to be A job spending time with my coworkers, and more focused on improving my performance at work. I still can feel sore from working so much and doing the work that I do sometimes, but when I do feel those sensory feelings in my body the Kratom helps me cope way better then I could if I didn't use Kratom. Kratom is A miracle herb for me. If I wasn't able to use Kratom I'd have to grind through my sport injuries without kratom, and that can be painful. If I wasn't able to use kratom, I would have to work less. Please try to have some empathy for me. I injured my heel, foot, and knee, and I am still working 50 hours at my warehouse job. I don't have A choice either my boss won't let me take A break to heal. With Kratom I can function much better, and not only keep up with my work schedule, but also be happy most of the time while at my challenging job. If I didn't have Kratom my thriving life could turn hellish really quick. A lot of people benefit from Kratom even more than me. Please don't ban the benign herb kratom, when alcohol and tobacco are legal, and combined kill about 580000 Americans every year. Alcohol and tobacco are far more dangerous then kratom. I don't drink, smoke or do illegal drugs. Kratom users are responsible American citizens that work, pay their taxes, and vote. We deserve to have access to A legal market to buy Kratom when alcohol and tobacco are on the legal market. I hope you live your life to your top values, and live up to your highest self whenever you do work on kratom. Thank you for reading my comment.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4314","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"James Barnes","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not expand the FAILED war on drugs by Banning kratom in the face of overwhelming  public support for ending it. ending it.\nBy adding kratom to any of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.

I am not a medical doctor.) I have been using kratom with some regularity for approximately three years. For me, the effects can best be described as \"mildly relaxing.\" It is not nearly as sedating as a glass of wine, and is about as relaxing as chamomile tea. For me, is no more addictive than coffee. There might some moderate psychological addiction but it's more connected to the familiarity of a pleasant routine than to physical changes in the brain chemistry of the user. I have often stopped taking kratom quite suddenly with no serious withdrawal effects other than brief intestinal distress. For me, the best thing about the plant is that it's great for irritable bowel syndrome. Without going into too much detail, it firms everything up. Unlike many substances considered to be recreational drugs, kratom does not really reward increasing the dose with stronger effects. Cranking up the dose simply makes it likely that a person will feel sick to the stomach and a bit woozy, just as drinking six cups of coffee might cause stomach problems and wooziness. For me, if kratom is made illegal, it is simply an inconvenience. I will miss the ritual, but life will go on. However, I am deeply concerned about the many thousands of Americans who have used kratom as a way of eliminating their dependence on opiates. I realize that the evidence is anecdotal, but there is plenty of this evidence, and the testimonials are overwhelming. So many people who have struggled with opiate addiction have been able to cut opiates out of their lives with the help of kratom. Without hyperbole, I believe that rescheduling kratom could have a terrible effect on many thousands of people. The DEA's announcement suggested that Kratom is responsible for countless calls to poison control, but a closer examination of the evidence reveals that very few incidents have been linked specifically to Katom. The DEA proposed adding Kratom to Schedule I without a serious review of the available scientific literature. If you search Google for \"Mitragyna speciosa,\" you will find more than 1,000 search results documenting the potential medical value of kratom. Yet, the DEA has concluded unilaterally that the supplement has no meaningful medical benefits. I suspect that some at the DEA made the mistake of confusing Kratom with synthetic cathinones known as \"bath salts.\" I think all reasonable people can agree that bath salts are terribly dangerous and should be banned. Kratom is not remotely close to bath salts. I also want to acknowledge that there is little \"quality control\" as far as importing the plant is concerned. It would be nice if there were some sort of regulation -- perhaps random sampling and leaf testing for all imports -- in an attempt to ensure that users are not subjected to heavy metal poisoning and/or contaminated samples. However, if the regulation is too restrictive -- if it chokes off the smaller suppliers -- I fear that it will be almost the same effect as a total ban. I also suspect that this type of regulation would be outside the scope of the DEA. Thanks for opening up to public comments. In closing, I just want to reiterate how valuable this plant seems to be for many recovering opiate addicts. This is not my situation, but I worry about the many who might be affected by this.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22886","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from chronic pain and as a result of this pain I became addicted to opiates/opioids.

I take it for a better quality of life, which it has allowed me to have.\n\nThere is an epidemic in this country people are dying and addiction is a part of every day life.

I'm a 26 year old male whom works in a kitchen, and has re-entered into higher education. (I had dropped out of college after 3 years of studying business with a opiate addiction to OxyContin that later developed into a heroin habit) I have since returned to school, having the ability to hold a job, be fully engaged in my relationships and, my own life. I actively used pain pills and heroin (predominantly)  for 7 years. It wrecked everything I had built or foolishly continued to try to build...\nI was introduced to kratom in the last year (beginning of 2016). Simply put, I take my kratom in the morning and, I have no overbareing cravings. I get through my day with full attention and focus - completely present in the moment... It is hard for me to put into words just how much of a blessing that is for me and, my family. \nIt has been a physically hard and emotionally fought battle to trudge through the gravitation heroin has had over my life. My family and friends were the only thing that showed me the light... Together we have invested over a year of each of our own time and money to help me get well i.e. Rehab or medication. These approachs were most definitely helpful but, didn't have much \"staying power\"... I now, as I said before can actually function in my day to day at school or at work running the kitchen as a lead cook of a high volume restaurant... To be blunt in conclusion, Kratom has saved my life.\n I beg you, to strongly consider my testimony and the others sent in. As this may end up being a huge turning point in the opiate epidemic we are currently experiencing. Because I have witnessed, not just in my own life but, others who have brought them selves out of the depths of opiate addiction with kratom. There are many who have left us with out choice, that suffered at the hands of their own addiction. And their families don't get them back, their mother can no longer hold them, experience a family holiday together, have a good vacation... or, live their own lives and find love - because the only love they found; left them dead in a bathroom stall, a kitchen floor, a train yard, behind a dumpster... or even a halfway house where they were trying to get clean and sober.... don't rob us of this opportunity to get well please. \n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nJosh Lindley","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10541","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Lindley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My daughter has a drinking problem and has been greatly helped by this product.

Ive decided to remain anonymous because I am afraid of it becoming a schedule one drug and me needing to continue to use it anyway.  I'm afraid because I might have to become a criminal in order to treat my chronic pain condition.\n\nFor starters, Im a 35 year old single mother.  Ten years ago while working in a very physical job,  I herniated 2 discs in my lower back, my l4-l5 and l5-s1.  My life changed with this event and I was never the same. I had two young children in the house,  I did everything to heal myself, rest, physical therapy, spinal injections, steroids, nerve pain blockers and opiate pain medication.  \n\nI had never taken Tramadol, Norco or Vicodin before, but it seemed like it was all the doctors had to offer me.  I took them daily for three years in order to be able to get out of bed and be the parent my children needed.\n\nI developed Osteoarthritis in my hips and back.  The doctors offered me higher and higher doses of pain meds as they became less and less effective and the arthritis became worse.\n\nThe drugs were not as effective as they needed to be and they made me mean and grumpy.  I would go through withdrawal as they wore down and my personality would flip.  I had an awful temper.  I was in pain and addicted to a horrible drug with no other option but to continue taking it, otherwise the pain was so great I couldn't get out of bed.\n\nI resolved to find another alternative to steroids and opiates because our life was miserable.  I tried everything and finally found Kratom.  i have replaced the steroids with turmeric extract, a natural anti inflammatory, and the Norco with Kratom.  '\n\nI brew Kratom tea twice a day. It is nothing like Norco.  The pain relief  is much better and sustained for longer.  The first week I used it I did get a bit of a \"high\" but it was very mild, certainly more mild than Vicodin.  That went away after a week but the pain relieving properties didn't.\n\nIve now used it for 2 years.  My dose has stayed the same for years. My doctor is AMAED I was able to stop taking Norcos. He told me I would probably need to take them for the rest of my life. The supplements, the Kratom, and exercise have given me and my family our life back.  I own a small business and am raising 2 amazing kids.   I am petrified of what scheduling this drug will mean for me.  I will have the choice of becoming a felon or going back to bottles of Tramadol and Norco for the rest of my life. \n\nPlease, I am literally begging you, don't take Kratom away from us with chronic pain conditions who rely on this plant for quality of life. Regulate it as needed so it is out of the hands of teenagers, but allow responsible adults to treat ourselves.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12617","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to ask you to please reconsider the ban on Kratom.

There are many law abiding citizens among them veterans, law enforcement, moms, grandmas and all of type of people who would prefer to use this natural product than to use pharmaceuticals especially narcotics. Kratom is no more addictive than coffee and less destructive than alcohol. You do not \"catch a buzz\" from Kratom. It feels more like your morning coffee but with no caffeine jitters and is milder. I am not sure how it works but it does help with pain and fatigue. I have also heard from others who have been addicted to opioids and other substances than just a small amount of kratom tea each day keeps them from having any cravings to go back to abusing substances. With the rampant opioid, heroin and alcohol addiction we have ruining lives every day in our country I would hate for something that works to battle against this issue to be taken away from people who say it has given their lives back to them.

My husband and I own and operate a very successful business. \n\nI started drinking Kratom tea 2 years ago, as I was looking for an all natural way to boost my mood and give me a little energy. Kratom helps me to be a better version of myself. It helps my anxiety & depression. Kratom helps me focus on, and stay motivated for the many tasks that I am responsible for as a wife, mother and business owner. Over the past 2 years I have noticed that I can consume Kratom tea after a long day to help me sleep more peacefully at night. Also, if I have aches & pain, I can drink a cup of Kratom tea and continue on with my day much more easily. Kratom is also alleged to give opiate addicts a safe alternative to death, which I beleive needs to be taken into serious consideration, especially in the midst of the current overdose epidemic that cannot and should NOT be glossed over.\n\nKratom is a plant, it is NOT a synthetic drug.  Kratom is all natural and should remain legal in all aspects, to all individuals who choose to consume it, as it is NOT life-threatening. Kratom has benefitted my life in countless ways. Without Kratom, I fear that I (and millions of others) will be forced back to depending on pharmacuticals, which I have found to have many adverse effects on my body, mind and general well-being. It would be a shameful atrocity for the DEA/FDA/BIGPHARMA to make another one of God's plants illegal, while simultaneously making more criminals out of America's  responsible and productive members of society.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2441","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have multiple painful disorders that cause me daily disabling pain. I started taking kratom two years ago and it's the reason I am still alive today. As a young person during this day and age (where doctors are very hesitant to prescribe effective amounts of pain management medications) I felt hopeless. I considered death. I literally remember a bad pain flare where I begged my fianc to kill me. I experience migraines that last days, painful muscle fibroids that cause giant knots all up and down my spine. I have bulging disks, aching joints. My ribs literally slip out of place, because of faulty connective tissue and the awful muscle tension that pulls them out of place. I have nerve pain, terrible insomnia, and some days I can't even walk. These are just a few of the things I deal with on a daily basis. Since finding kratom, my depression has lifted a lot. I have enough pain management on good days to actually do things, when I was completely bedridden before. It helps with my headaches, it helps me sleep. It helps when my joints ache and when my RLS gets bad. It helps my anxiety/PTSD, it dulls that awful bone deep ache in my hips. When I have sciatica pain shooting up and down my legs and lower back, it helps. It helps me deal with muscle spasms. Nearly every pain I have is helped. It doesn't cure anything, but there is no cure for any of it. \n\nIt's allowed me to get a puppy and walk almost every day. I couldn't even walk to the bathroom on bad days before. I would go without water because I hurt too much to stand and get myself some. \n\nI've tried considerable amounts of medications. Kratom had some of the least bothersome side effects. I had mild nausea at first as well as being a little warm. The worst was when my heart rate got a little fast, but I literally had to go to the hospital over having a cup of tea once, my heart was so sensitive to the caffeine. It wasn't half that bad. I'm generally very chemically sensitive, to the point that my doctors plan for me to get side effects and choose medications with that in mind. But kratom was not difficult for me to take. In my experience, it's way less sedating or intoxicating than other legal substances. I didn't feel impeded, I could function well. But my pain was lifted. It's just blatantly wrong to say that there are no medical uses, because there are literally tens of thousands of us using kratom for medical purposes alone. \n\nAs far as withdrawal symptoms, they're honestly very mild. I've been through pain medication withdrawals--I was prescribed OxyContin at one point, and I've been on  little 5 mg vicodins. Kratom's withdrawals are easier than both. Frankly, I've had considerably more difficulty coming off an antidepressant, or my seizure medication. I was in agony for weeks when I tried to come off lyrica. Kratom? Mild RLS. That was all I noticed. Obviously my pain returned full force, as I wasn't treating it with anything. But it has no real negative or dangerous withdrawal symptoms. I didn't feel \"addicted\", not any more than you'd call antidepressant withdrawals \"addiction\". Apart from desire to feel better, I don't feel any emotional/mental draws. I don't crave my next cup of Kratom tea, it's easy to choose not to have it. I've been at a stable serving size for over a year. It doesn't seem to have the same negatives that long term opioid use does.\n\nKratom is one of the most effective pain management solutions that I've tried. I've tried a lot of them. It allows me to function at almost full capacity. The worst part is that it tastes bad and it's a little pricy. But I'd happily pay, because it's so valuable to be able to enjoy my life. To not be crushed under the heavy weight of depression. To sleep on a more regular basis. To be able to walk to get water, or food, when on bad days I had to go without until my fianc got home to help me. That's invaluable. Kratom saved my life. Please don't take it away from all of us who need it for serious medical purposes.

Banning this benevolent herb would, to me, represent a real setback. \n\nI thought the authorities wanted people to reduce their use of narcotics.

Schedule 1 uses circular reasoning that any drug included has no therapeutic use; therefore there is no reason to test it for therapeutic use because it is a Schedule 1 drug.\n\nProhibition never works; it just destroys lives. The quality of my sister's life has radically improved due to kratom. Please do not harm my sister and others who are helped by kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21866","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Jozwiak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Randall Chambers, I am 27 and work as a chef here in Denver, Colorado.

I was, at one point, bound to prescribed pain medications for a period of approximately 4 months due to a lower back injury.  Not knowing what addiction or dependence was, I took them steadily those 4 months while my back \"healed,\" and, for the first 3 months, functioned quite well.  The 4th month I felt my strain had improved but found myself challenged to stop the medication.  I felt sick- depressed- miserable.  Not knowing why, I went to my physician, who then prescribed me 12mg of Suboxone.  Let's just say, mg for mg, the dosage was entirely too high and it became an even worse problem than ever before, taking a solid 3 years and 8 attempts to finally quit.  Since then, I've never touched a pain medication and, honestly, don't  like taking any medication.  \nNot long ago it was recommended I try Kratom for my frequent migraines, as well as some other ailments I had.  \"It's not a pain killer like you'd expect- you won't get high, you won't be euphoric, and you may still have some pain, but it's certainly a valuable tool for your arsenal,\" I was told.  Since then, I've taken Kratom here and there for headaches/migraines, back aches, and various other ailments.  I've used it for long periods of time and short periods of time, each phase stopping for breaks and never feeling miserable.  I've cut back on coffee from it!  I am a happier person because of it.  I've never felt like I was going to overdose (though once, when changing my vendor source, I did take more than usual and ending up puking twice before I felt normal, thus teaching me the valuable lesson \"less is more.\"  I've also helped others discover the benefits of Kratom and have observed them go from pharmaceutical relief to natural relief.  WHat a difference it has made for them and myself.\nI am all for regulating certain things, but to treat kratom like a vilified plant, making it a Schedule I and illegal to own or possess or consume, is not only a foolish mistake, but a violation of our rights as US citizens.  Alcohol kills more people, directly and indirectly, than kratom ever has or ever will, meanwhile has no true benefits that can be touted, whereas kratom has a wide array of benefits.  I see no reason to outlaw kratom and make it yet another street drug- which is exactly what will happen- for the police to deal with and to load up our prisons.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13644","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Daniel Richmond","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\"Kratom is a long-established folk remedy in southeast Asia, where it is traditionally popular among day laborers and has long been used as a replacement therapy for people struggling with opiate addiction. Kratom leaves can be chewed fresh, or dried and consumed in powder, tea or bar form. In small doses, it can have stimulant-like effects, and in larger quantities it acts as a sedative. Side effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opiates or amphetamines.\"\n\n\"Many people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.  With U.S. currently suffering from an overdose epidemic linked to opioids, it's absurd to criminalize a substance that many people use to help with opioid withdrawal.

I also take care of my disabled grandmother. I have many health issues that cause me great pain, constantly. To name a few: Endometriosis, pinched and dilated fallopian tube, dysuria, ovarian cysts, fibroids, painful ovulation/ menstrual cycle, gastritis, esonophilloc esophagitis,etc. Before I had my secobd c section my pain was monthly, from age 14. After the c section, which was done improperly, I was in constant pain, it's been almost a year now. In the beginning of the year I fought my doctor just to receive pain medication and fought to have tests done. My primary doctor refused after a while to provide pain medication, nausea medication, any medication at all. I'm currently picking a new primary yet in the meantime I found myself facing a life of pain, viewed from bed. Then I was told by a good friend about kratom, having been without pain relief for a month I was sure I'd just have to \"deal with it\" as my doctor told me I should do. Yet I was surprised to find out, it worked, better than any pain medication, and I got my energy back on top of that! I was able to stop going to the hospital, which I've been to 23 times this year alone. After a little while I even noticed my gerd was no longer a problem. I was able to stop taking my Zantac for that, and eat food normally again. The first time I tried kratom, I cried, tears of joy and relief, I was able to play with my kids again, do things normal people do, and I am still amazingly grateful for it. Please, please dont take that from me, from us, I've never had a withdrawal from kratom, no ill side effects, only help and hope. Please don't take that from me, from anyone, I beg you. Don't take me from living my life with my children and grandmother. Without kratom I don't know what I'll do, I can't go back to the hospital every week again because they won't see me. I'm fighting so hard to get a doctor who treats me like a person, even so I'd rather I never even have to look at a narcotic again in my life, because they only make me worse off. Again, I'm begging you, don't take that from me, from anyone.

It sounds like many users are finding tremendous benefits.Our rush to ban \"drugs\" is absurd. It would be nice if we actually looked at our banned \"drugs\" or \"substances\" in a critical and intelligent manner. Cannabis is illegal yet there are no associated deaths connected to it's use. However; alcohol is very much legal and there are substantial deaths associated with it. Can we take a look at our opioid epidemic? People are dying on a daily basis from the use of opiates (Vicodin, Oxycontin, Heroin) yet our doctors will willingly prescribe them to us? But the possession of a plant can land you in prison (I am a non cannabis user for the record)? Someone give me a reasonable explanation for this please. And please don't give me any Nancy Reagan war on drugs horse hockey about a \"gateway drug\". That's like calling french fries a \"gateway drug to heart disease\". Should we ban the consumption of french fries to help curb the heart disease problem (the # killer of American's if I'm not mistaken). Of course not. Again - can we please take a rational look at what is legal and illegal based on scientific research? Way too many of our policies are backwards and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe Kratom has negative impacts - but let's at least do our due diligence before we run off creating yet another schedule 1 drug. Let's actually think and lean on science for once.

I lived with the pain for 30 years until I could not stand it anymore after turning 41. I was dead set against using opoids because I had seen what it did to families. You see I had an uncle that was addicted to the pain medicines and saw him lose his arm due to infection from needles.....and he eventually died from  it. I had no choice though then to go into pain management because the pain was unbearable. While on the pain meds, I had to quit my job because I could not drive with them. It turned my stomach into scrambled eggs. My husband and children suffered because I was in bed all day. Desperate to find an alternative before I fell victim to addiction, I found kratom from a friend. I quit pain pills cold turkey and now work a productive 50 hours a week along with being in my last semester of RN school. If this becomes illegal, I will once again have to depend on the state and tax payers to take care of me and my family. Do not Schedule kratom.

I'm a 44-year-old software developer who used to be a development manager at Microsoft. I left the industry temporarily to raise my kids as a stay-at-home mom. Two years ago, I fell off a horse and injured my sacroiliac joint. Thus began a medical odyssey as I saw an orthopedist and a sports medicine specialist, had multiple MRIs and joint injections, went through months of physical therapy with two different therapists, and tried alternative treatments like massage therapy and chiropracty.\n\nNothing helped, and I was in constant daily pain. Frustrated by the inability of doctors to help my condition, I tried kratom, and it was miraculous. In my experience, kratom relieves joint pain better than percocet does, and without making me \"foggy\" in the head (as percocet does). I have been taking it daily for about a year, purely for pain management. I do not experience a \"high\" and do not want one. I just want my pain to go away (or be reduced) so I can be functional and active, so I can continue to exercise and stay healthy, so I can go to my kids' concerts and not be terrified of the extreme pain that being trapped in a chair for two hours can bring.\n\nWhen I travel, I do not bring my kratom because I'm not certain of the law in traveling with it. Last summer I went to Japan for 10 days without kratom and while I did experience the expected amount of pain, because I had nothing to control it with, I experienced no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. In my experience, kratom is not addictive.\n\nIn recent months, I've had a medical breakthrough in my condition. My doctor, who originally thought my problem was in the muscles, now understands the pain is in the joint itself. This led to a joint injection that provided significant relief, and now I wear an SI belt that helps even more. My pain is not gone but is greatly reduced, and I've been able to cut in half the amount of kratom I use. Again, I experienced no withdrawal or consequences. It's just like taking Advil once a day instead of twice a day.\n\nThere is hope that another procedure, a neurotomy, may reduce my pain even further, to the point where I don't need kratom at all. My doctor and I are looking into that now. I am lucky, in that my chronic pain condition may turn out to be treatable after all, but many people are not so lucky. So many people in this country suffer from unrelenting chronic pain, and opiates are a problematic solution. I believe kratom needs to remain available as a herbal pain reliever and alternative to dangerous opiates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1523","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Raby","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped tons of people in many ways .

I was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia 6 years ago after emergency oral surgery. For this there is no cure, & it is documented as the most painful condition known to mankind. Many who have this attempt suicide due to the pain that is severe & unpredictable. Ive have been on EVERY type of medication, missed SO many days, weeks, & months of mine, my husband's, & my daughter's lives because I wanted to be numb &/or sleep the pain away...only time I was not in pain was when I took vast amounts of painkillers,  or when knocking myself out with ambien. These are addictive, dangerous & they often do not work well. A DEAR friend w the same condition knew I was @ my end, in constant pain , & suicidal from the guilt of not being there for my daughter the way I needed to be. My friend introduced me to Kratom six months ago, & I am HAPPY, SOBER, PRODUCTIVE, A MOTHER & WIFE & DAUGHTER AGAIN. Because of kratoms ability to reduce my pain and depression, I have been able to concentrate fully in culinary school. I have, since beginning school in September, had a GPA of 100% in every course Ive completed, & passed a difficult exam with the highest grade in my class.

I have MANY friends that have eithernlost there lives or lost very close loved ones themselves to Heroin.  \n\nAbout 40 percent of those heroin addiction cases STARTED WITH VICODINE from the doctor.  They had legitimite pain, and were given a pill by a Doctor who said \"take this while we heal you up, and it wont hurt so bad\"  who would refuse that?   \n\nWhat they dont say is \" this is EXTREMELY addictive, and its going to take many months of weening off after you start taking it\"    But they dont ween them off!!  They just cut them off,  leaving them to travel the town looking for 5-8 dollar pills!!! \n\nI have PERSONNALY seen a man i grew up with, never smoked a joint!  Never got to to drunk on beer at one time!!  He had a wife and 4 children who were his world.  He was a welder, and well paid for his skills.  He also had a very promising career in Motocross, somthing that was a passion (and true talent) from a very young age.  \n\nWell he had a wreck, punctured splein, lung, and damaged vertebre..  3 years later he knocks on my door saying he has been SNOORTING 14 1000mg vicodine a DAY and he cant stop he needs help doesnt know what to do..  i helped him start treatment plans and it looked pretty good, but by now he has been spending ALL his money on street pills as the doctor had cut him off cpmpetly after buildimg him up to rediculous dosses to manage the pain in his vertebre..  So between an already decaed body, as he had stopped eating much food, and a turbulant home life due to the buying of street pills he finnaly got to a dark place and turned to other opiates to stop \"pain\" but by now there was more pain in his head than his body.. he was on heroin for almost a year before before he finnaly was able to hold himself from it.  Without his amazing wife who stuck by him thru ALL there is no doubt he would have been ANOTHER heroin funeral i would have to attend.. Tim made it out, but he will live with that thirst for the rest of his life.. \n\nIf i had this stuff in my possesion when he knocked on my door, or better yet!  If the doctor said \"here lets try this for your pain managment\"   maybe.. just maybe all that mess and horribleness could have been lessened.. \n\nI am no doctor and dont know the long term effects of krotam on the body, i doubt its something that would be good to take daily for 20 years, but neither are doughnuts.. \n\nPLEASE i am asking you to NOT make this substance illegal to aquire or posses, i understand doctors cannot prescribe this material.  But i beleive our people should have the option to treat there condition how they and there family feel they should, not how others feel they should, and i dont feel that dropping them in the wind for them to THEN seek there own treatment and use opiates that KILL is a good practice..    In our area just outside of Saint Louis Mo, its a DEATH SENTENCE..

It was the right thing to do.  That said, I am 100% opposed to the ban or any scheduling of kratom.  I am not a regular user myself, but I have tried it on occasion in the past and can say from personal experience that it is very mild in effect.  The thought of it being scheduled next to lsd and heroin seems absurd to anyone that has actually used it.  I was first introduced to kratom by my younger brother.  He was a longtime worker in a tire warehouse.  The job was grueling work and did a number on his body.  Due to the pain and nature of his job, he was turned onto opiate pain pills to get him  through his work weeks.  Naturally, that turned into addiction and his tolerance increased over time.  Eventually, he was able to ingest amounts of Oxycontin that would  and has on many occasion, killed people.  His quality of life was in a downward spiral, each day depending on more and more of this harsh opiate drug.  Then he discovered kratom.  He was able to ween himself completely off of any pharmaceutical drug with its help.  His life has improved dramatically.  I have seen more than a handful of friends and people that I have grown up with die from overdosing on pharmaceutical opiate drugs and was very fearful that my younger brother would eventually wind up doing the same.  That fear is no longer there for me or for him and its all thanks to this wonderful plant kratom.  This is just one example of how this plant has helped people.  There are thousands if not millions more.  Our nation is supposed to be the land of the free.  We as responsible, law abiding adults should have the right to choose to use all natural plants and herbs if we desire.  So in closing, I just want to reiterate that I am completely opposed to the ban or any scheduling of the plant kratom.  It will cause the death and destruction of thousands of American lives if initiated.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0640","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Justin Franklin","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom is not dangerous.

There are always going to be idiots out there that bend the rules but that happens with everything from big Pharma products all the way down to regular over the counter discount-Mart products. Kratom is all natural and doesn't need to be illegal. Marijuana is becoming legal almost everywhere and soon it will be every state...and Kratom doesn't even come close to the effects that a plant like Marijuana has. Kratom has absolutely zero reason to reside in any scheduled class. Please stay away from scheduling Kratom, it helps so many people. I've personally known about Kratom for over 11 years...I don't use it but I've tried it before, so I know why it can benefit so many people. Kratom is in no way anything like a schedule 1 drug. I think the DEA needs to back down from this fight because the people will not stand for it. There are so many \"real\" dangerous substances out there that the DEA should focus on..and Kratom is NOT one of those. Bath Salts and things like that need to be stopped because they kill people and kids. Kratom doesn't kill anyone.

I was a wife, mother, successful business owner etc.  This plant caused no ill effects whatsoever, and actually allowed me to function better than the opiates prescribed by my doctor.\nI have severe endometriosis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, IBS, Lyme disease, as well as having lasting damage from car accidents,  horse accidents etc.\nEventually my pain got so severe that I started having seizures from the pain and had to go onto narcotics full time,  My doctor said the seizures could harm my brain, and I needed to go on full time narcotics until they could determine what was causing the severe pain resulting in seizures.  This started with methadone, then morphine, then finally fentanyl.  I was on 200 mcg/hr, which is an enourmlis dose for a young,  otherwise healthy person like me.  \nIt took two years to figure out the cause of the pain and treat enough to see progress.  This year I was sick of the side effects of the fentanyl, and was completely bed ridden and an invalid.  I SO wanted to get off this poison that was making me puke all the time, and my teeth fall out.  Kratom is what made it possible for me to get off fentanyl and I a proud to say my doctor is amazed I was able to wean myself off such a huge dose!  (The prescribing doctor dumped me suddenly due to other issues in his practice, and it took months to find another doc who would take over my pain management.  So we were on our own!). Kratom saved my life when my pain specialist dropped me.  I was so ill at the time I would have died of dehydration without kratom,  today I'm 100% free of fentanyl, and I don't even have to take Kratom very often!  But I'd sure rather take a plant than a medication that addicted and almost killed me, and was utter hell to get off of.  \nAnyone who compares kratom with drugs is ignorant of basic chemistry.  Anyone who claims withdrawals from kratom is hell, is also the same kind of person who would call in sick from coffee withdrawal when they wake up to find the folders can empty.  It's literally that suimple.  It's a close close relative of the coffee tree, and \"withdrawals\" are much the same as coffee.  And implying that is anything near the sheer misery and agony of heroin or fentanyl withdrawal is not only outrageous, but to those of us who have been through the horrors of REAL with drawls, it is downright offensive.  \nI have never taken medication that was not prescribed to me legally by my doctor, but still have found myself in the horrors of withdrawals so severe they kept me in bed and my husband at my side 24/7, over and over again as doctors changed or ended medications.  Once I found kratom my fear of withdrawals was lessened greatly.  It helped, never hindered.  \nThe idea that anyone would ban a plant is beyond me.  It's morally wrong.  People should be allowed to choose what they try for themselves.  Outlawing kratom will have disasterous effects on the drug culture, and send tons more pain patients underground to get illegal drugs that could really harm them to cope with their pain since the plant they used has been taken away.  Kratom has fewer deaths attributed to it in the last 5 years than Tylenol does, and yet you want us to believe this ban is for our \"safety???\"   WAKE UP!  Please, please fight on the side of freedom.  Regardless of your personal opinions or choirs, don't you want the right to make those choices?  Ok.  So do we.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8927","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am extremely opposed to listing Kratom as Schedule 1, meaning it has no medicinal value. This is not true, based on the anecdotal evidence of hundreds of thousands of people. More research is needed into the therapeutic benefits of Kratom, but these efforts will be squelched if it is listed as schedule 1.\n\nI am an educated, tax-paying professional, who uses Kratom regularly. I have no criminal record and hope to keep it that way, but I will use the medicinal plants that help me, regardless. This plant has been a GOD-SEND to me in helping with my diabetic neuropathy. It apparently has also LOWERED my blood sugar, a surprising result I did not expect. Yet another reason to encourage more research into its therapeutic applications!\n\nI cannot afford health insurance. Because of my diabetes, there are almost no insurance companies who will insure me, and the one who is available charges a rate I can't afford. I have been learning about plant-based medicine because of it being more accessible to me. Kratom is one of those plants that has helped me a lot, and it seems to help millions of others, too. It also helps me relax and improves my mood, yet leaves me unimpaired, as so many pharmaceuticals do.\n\nKratom is not an opiate. Please do not treat it as one just because it has some opiate-like effects. It is a member of the coffee family.

I am a 36 year old woman. I have suffered from crippling depression for most of my life. A few years ago i was considering suicide, as i was so desperate to end my suffering, when a friend recommended i try kratom. She had formally been addicted to prescription opiate pills for a decade following an accident related injury. She had completely ended that addiction due to her use of kratom. I decided to give it a shot. I was instantly amazed at the peace it allowed me to feel in my daily life and the relief it brought. It allowed me to get out of bed finally and work. It allowed me to keep a job for years now instead of quitting because of this depression, which has happened so many times in my life.  I have gone periods of time without kratom since then, but have mostly chosen to take it daily as nothing has ever helped me cope with my depression as well. I have tried every type of pharmaceutical antidepressant, mood stabilizer, etc. All have made my problems worse and the side effects were intolerable on my sensitive system\n Kratom has helped like nothing else. I also used to use alcohol heavily, and for some reason when i take kratom, i completely lose my desire to drink. That alone is a godsend that has me and the ones who love me feeling so grateful. \nKratom doesnt get me high. It just ever so subtly lifts my mood from absolute darkness and devastation to a feeling of being ok and able to cope with life. As mental illness is partly genetic, i recently found out that my father, who sufferers from bipolar disorder, has also found relief through the use of kratom and has taken it daily for the last several years as well. \n\nThis plant is a miracle in my life and the lives of so many. I can honestly say it may have even saved my life and the life of my best friend and many, many others. I believe i should have the choice of whether or not i want to continue to use this completely natural and affordable plant medicine. If i have that right and choice taken away from me, i may need to move out of this country just so i can have legal access to my medicine and so i can remain a productive and alive person.  Thank you for taking the time to listen to the people who this issue effects.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1356","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I  was diagnosed 14 years ago with severe Restless Leg Syndrome, Willis Ekbom Disease. My legs and sometimes whole body jerks uncontrollably. Mostly at night, but I have it mornings and daytime as well. Anytime I am tired. I have it day and night . My prescription medicines knock me out and make me drowsy (Ropinerole and Clonazapam) I also take in the morning Topamax. Mid afternoon or early evening when I am working out of town and up ladders I use Kratom (in the coffee family)  as I don't get drowsy. I am sober, working and it stops the jerking and relieves the symptoms. If I take the prescribed meds and ride in a car I have seizures. This has happened several times a few years back and I have feared it would kill me. The last seizure I vomited., lost my bladder, and seizures repeatedly. I can NOT take those meds and ride in a car. The Kratom WORKS! I travel around the state painting window signs every day and need to work and travel. Kratom allows me to lead a normal productive life. I am not high. I am 58 years old and very successful in my sign business. It has been a miracle for me. Without Kratom for my condition I will SUFFER in hell.  I have used Kratom since I read about it 6 years ago when I heard it helped Parkinsons and Restless Leg Syndrome. My meds are also Parkinsons meds so I tried it. I have tried many herbs and even pot and nothing else ever worked. I do not like being high. Kratom does NOT make me high. It has been a real blessing for me and both the doctors I have had think it is wonderful and approve.  My current doctor thinks it is insane that DEA would compare it to an opiate as it is very mild. And she agrees I will be in a very horrible situation if it is banned. It IS MEDICINAL. That is why pharmaceuticals are patenting it. At LEAST offer a medical card for people like me who. I am a responsible adult who NEEDS this herb for my quality of life. The Bible says \"Yours is the Earth and Everything In it.\". God made Kratom to heal my condition. That is my right to feel well and no one should deny me. Do the RIGHT THING. Keep Kratom legal.  Kratom allows me to take a break from the prescription medicines so K can ride in a vehicle in the evenings and not have a seizure. I need Kratom to relieve RLS . I NEED IT. IT IS NOT RECREATIONAL IT IS MY MEDICINE FOR RLS. There is NO DANGER. Too much Kratom is not fun, it would give someone a headache and nausea. It is NOT a party drug. It is mostly used by older adults who are in control, using for MEDICINAL purposes. Not for fun.. People mention psychoactive properties or euphoria. I don't experience any of that. All it does for me is alleviate the jerking and relax my legs and body from the horrble spasm I SUFFER every day and night otherwise. And prevents the seizures while riding in the car. PLEASE PLEASE understand. Feel free to call me and see I AM SOBER any time day or night I would love to speak to anyone who wants to know more about it or understand the effects or lack of about Kratom. This herb is VERY misunderstood. I don't drink or smoke pot. I don't like feeling out of it. Kratom is what I have to have to survive through this miserable condition. It really DOES RELIEVE RLS. I wrote letters to FDA and Naturopath Ass years ago to help others. Please do what is right for me and others with my condition.

Below I present the following arguments for your consideration:\n\n1) With over 25 different alkaloids, we do not fully have the science to understand this plant. In such cases, traditional cultural use over multiple decades should be taken into consideration. In cultures where the plant grows, it has been safely used as a traditional medicine. Leaves are chewed to relieve musculoskeletal pain, increase energy, appetite, and sexual desire (see Warner ML, Kaufman NC, Grundmann O (2016). \"The pharmacology and toxicology of kratom: from traditional herb to drug of abuse\". Int. J. Legal Med. (Review). 130 (1): 127-38.)\n2) While plant pharmacology is not fully understood, we know that some alkaloids in the plant act on opioid receptors and relieve pain. A key benefit that users are reporting is that Kraton can be an effective alternative to opioid based medicines which are highly addictive and have serious side effects. The key is that pain relief from Kraton is reported at relatively low doses (1-5g of raw leaves), which are below the threshold for dependence and negative long-term side effects (>15g of raw leaves). See Warner ML, Kaufman NC, Grundmann O (2016). \"The pharmacology and toxicology of kratom: from traditional herb to drug of abuse\". Int. J. Legal Med. (Review). 130 (1): 127-38\n3) While there is some evidence for addiction potential, this is not yet well understood. The CDC reports of poisoning (~660) are a concern but need to be fully understood before take away the public's right to access a potentially beneficial plant. For example, did any deaths involve the traditional use of chewing leaves or where processed extracts involved? Were the deaths really driven by Kraton or driven by other circumstances (e.g. concurrent Opioid use, health issue, etc.) A review of the peer reviewed literature shows that serious toxicity is relatively rare and generally appears at high doses (beyond those need for medicinal use) or when Kratom is used with other substances. See Rech, MA; Donahey, E; Cappiello Dziedzic, JM; Oh, L; Greenhalgh, E (February 2015). \"New drugs of abuse.\". Pharmacotherapy. 35 (2): 189-97 \n\nIn conclusion, while the DEA concerns due to reported poisonings are understandable, based (a) on our current early scientific knowledge, (b) the large numbers of reported positive US user personal experiences, and (c) the long-term accepted medicinal properties of the plant in societies that have been using the plant for many decades, the move to put Krapton on Schedule I is unwarranted. Based on the evidence presented above, such a move would be detrimental to our society and an unnecessary loss of personal freedom and choice for citizens looking into new ways to manage their health issues with alternative natural substances. A few irresponsible recreational users that take excessive (and possibly processed/concentrated) dosages outside of the culturally proven safe medicinal use of 1-5g of raw plant material should not cause a responsible institution like the DEA to overreact and remove access of this medicinal plant to the thousands of users that claim relief from it.\n\nThank you,\n\nDr. Manuel Breva, PhD.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Manuel Breva","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not outlaw a harmless coffee-like herb like kratom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5934","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"hello,\n As a chronic pain patient of 14 years, i discovered kratom when side effects from legitimately prescribed opioid medication became unbearable. it took sixteen horrible months to get off these over prescribed dangerous drugs. two months before my last pill, i bought some kratom and learned how to use it.

I was attending a Christian concert on September 29th and I broke my ankle and I begin to take hydrocodone which was prescribed by my informed doctor that I am an addict in recovery. I do not wish to be back on opiates again as they have enslaved my life before. Today is October 31st Halloween and I ingested 6 Kratom caplets from a distributor known as O.P.M.S.  I took 6 caplets of .5 grams each of Kratom Silver \"Malay Special Reserve\". I am totally new to this product and the vendor from which I purchased it so I started out with a recommended dosage of two caplets. After not feeling any relief of pain after 30 minutes I orally ingested two more caplets. And after 30 more minutes of not feeling any pain relief orally ingested two more caplets. 30 minutes after that I still did not feel any kind of pain relief at all whatsoever or any other kind of euphoria or anything at all whatsoever. As I said above Kama I am an addict in recovery and have been for almost 7 years now and I would like to have an alternative to pharmaceutical prescription painkillers.

Kratom imo is able to address pain and anxiety amongst many other things, but is much milder and much for friendly to your body. It' doesn't steal your personality away and has NO WHERE near the side effects as prescription pharmaceutical's prescribed for the same ailmants. It would be a crime to deprive the people of are country from such a safe effective alternative. If the Dea truly cares for the people of the US they will keep this plant legal. I can't help but to think that the pharmacitical companies provoked the ban on Kratom due to loss of profits from having kratom as an alternative. PLEASE KEEP KRATOM LEGAL.

I am writing to you today to let you know that I oppose the DEAs idea of placing mitragyna speciosa and it's active alkaloid mitragynine (found in the plant kratom) on the schedule 1 list. \n\nAlthough I do not partake in the supplement kratom myself, my husband (a disabled US Army veteran) has found great relief in its use with his anxiety, depression, and PTSD. He uses this leaf as a tisane - steeping the crushed leaves in water and drinking it, and does this in addition to taking his depression/anxiety medicine prescribed to him by the VA to give him a better quality of life. \n\nSince we discovered this plant almost a year ago, his quality of life has increased tenfold, and he has been much happier and healthier than when he was on his medication alone. He has begun to enjoy living his every day life, and he feels like he can finally live his life the way he wants - without the crippling anxiety, fear, and pain that his life had been for over ten years. He has less trouble going out into crowds (like grocery store, traffic, movies, amusement parks), which previously were extremely difficult tasks for him to manage. He even enjoys going out, and suggests excursions on his own. He is also better able to manage his stress levels to prevent or stop currently active anxiety attacks when they are occuring, instead of being forced to suffer through them for hours upon hours at a time. In fact, he has reduced his total number of anxiety attacks from 2-3 a month, to only 1 total for this ENTIRE year! He no longer flashes back at the sound of every firework, car backfire, or loud noise, and also no longer tenses up from the helicopters as they fly overhead. For the first time in his adult life since before the war, he is finally experiencing the relief he deserves. He smiles more, he laughs more... he is a changed man, and I am absolutely floored by the progress he has made since discovering this supplement.\n\nThe DEA should not schedule mitragyna speciosa and it's active alkaloid mitragynine. The DEA refers to mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as \"opioids,\" however they are actually alkaline compounds that are believed to act on natural opioid receptors in the brain. Opioids are a synthetic compound of the poppy plant, while Kratom is NOT. The unique properties of mitragynine include a molecular mechanism for slowing down opioid tolerance (addiction), and does not cause respiratory depression (the fatal property of every other opioid - and the leading factor in opioid deaths). If this compound is made illegal, American scientists, will not be able to take part in researching this very unique compound, which may very well hold the key to creating a new generation of less addictive, less deadly pain killers. \n\nThis study found reduced potential for opioid addiction when mitragynine is coadministered with morphine: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550129\n\nThis study found no respiratory depression in kratom users (respiratory depression is the reason so many are dying from opioids in this country): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425236/\n\nPlease, do not schedule the supplement kratom as a schedule 1 drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17157","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Lillian Bain","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me out in life in multiple ways.

There has been no evidence that Kratom can be lethal, and the recent increase in sales of Kratom in the U.S. over the past few years says nothing more than simply more people are buying Kratom, not however, like the DEA suggests, that the sales increases are an indication of a growing drug abuse related trend. Kratom is an effective pain killer that does not have the high health risks of the common over the counter pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen, and ibuprofen, all of which can cause internal bleeding and severe damage to the liver and other organs if taken in larger doses, which does occur in many cases because people are not able to get a sufficient amount of pain relief for their paticular ailments because these drugs simply were not designed to handle anything more severe than mild pain. In the case of pharmaceutical opiates, and opioids there is a necessity for a doctor's prescription and recommendations due to the severely high chance of overdose/over-intoxication. I personally have taken Kratom on many occasions and can testify that these risks simply are not a factor with Kratom use. What I personally found was that Kratom does two things naturally to the human body, one thing of course is the way it acts like an opioid and provides moderate pain relief, the other however that Kratom acts like a stimulant, much like caffeine, therefore when you take too much you do not become over-intoxicated with an opiate-like \"high\", the stimulant qualities of the drug take over and over stimulate your nerves causing shaking and body tremors. After such an experience, much like drinking far too much coffee, the user quickly learns to moderate their dose to lower levels in order to avoid these undesirable side effects. Any of the cases where Kratom has been involved in a lethal situation, the user had other drugs, such as opiates and benzodiazepines in their system and is conclusive that their overdose was either caused by these other drugs and these other drugs alone, or a combination of other drugs with the Kratom, there have been no cases of anyone dying in the U.S. or abroad from taking Kratom alone. Taking Kratom off of the shelves puts hard opiate abusers back into a precarious situation where they will steal, commit violent act, or do anything possible to find an opiate fix. The availability of Kratom does a great deal to alleviate this problem in our communities. It would be unwise and socially irresponsible to turn back the clock and place opiate abusers who have found and prefer this safe alternative back in the literal life or death situation of procuring their opiate fix. I believe the sale of Kratom can be regulated more tightly in these stores and online, where the seller and the buyer can be held accountable in cases of abuse. Kratom should only be sold under the guise as a herbal supplement used for vitality and to control mild to moderate pain for adults only, and it would be completely reasonable to require and I.D. to purchase Kratom, however no rational person who has any experience with this substance can advocate outright prohibition. Even in the face of the many who may continue to abuse Kratom for the slight high it may give, the overall health benefits, and social benefits greatly outweigh the negative attributes of Kratom use. Mind you, we are in an age where opiate addiction has sky rocketed due to prescriptions from doctors nationwide. These doctors have no other recourse in the vast majority of these cases than to prescribe opiates for pain because there simply is no alternative, however we are seeing patients in droves being kicked out by their pain doctors, or prescribing doctors who have taken them into this world of addiction, necessary or not, primarily because doctors fear having their lisences to pratice medicine revoked, and even serving prison time for prescribing opiate medications. Here we now have this healthy and non lethal alternative to the dismay of opiate addiction. Please consider the well being of society at larage and allow Kratom to continue to be sold legally throughout the United States. This country can't tote the load of more wide spread opiate addiction throughout our communites.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0378","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"organization":"Myself","postedDate":"2016-10-18T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Malone","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello my name is Tony and I work as a lineman for Duke Energy.

After my doctor discontinued my opiods, i had to quit working altogether and i couldn't even babysit my grandkids. Then someone suggested I try kratom. It proved to be a godsend - I could sleep again! I was functional again! While still not able to work (kratom is not, after all, a true opiod) as I still have significant pain, I can sit up to read and knit and I once again enjoy spending time with my grandkids. \nWhen I first heard there may be a ban on kratom, I thought I would be ok as medical marijuana was going to be legalized in the state of Ohio. Although I don't especially like the thought of being high; the reason I didn't smoke mj in college was because it put me to sleep. Now, given my situation, that would be a positive. But again I would be missing or on a lot of life.... It became moot though as I've come to find out mmj won't actually be available for at least 2 years. \nIf you ban kratom by making it a controlled substance, I'll have no recourse to deal with my pain. I'll once again be unable to sleep - which only worsens the pain. And I will sink into depression (I came very close before I found kratom) from being isolated from my community. I will feel worthless as I will be unable to contribute in any meaningful way. I will only be a burden to my family with nothing to offer in return. Not the kind of life I would wish on anyone. \nPlease reconsider placing kratom on the controlled substance list, not only for my sake but also for all the other chronic pain sufferers in this country. \nThank you for your consideration. \nBelow please find some supporting  information regarding pain management in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4548768/\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pLw29ndmLcA\n\nSincerely, \nSheryl Hickman","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4698","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Sheryl Hickman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has helped me so much.

I agree that both Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine should be placed into a schedule; however, placing them into schedule 1 would be a mistake for a few reasons. First of all, placing Kratom into schedule 1 would mean that \"The drug or other substance has no currently accepted\nmedical use in treatment in the United States\", which thousands of people have found untrue. Secondly, placing the drug into schedule 1 would make it extremely difficult to be studied by scientists, which would be inappropriate. It is our duty to perform sufficient research on substances that have the potential to save lives.\n\n I can understand where your agency is coming from given the current heroin epidemic and the fact that the effects of Kratom are similar to opioids. I also understand that for a while Kratom was sold in smoke shops (at least where I live) right next to highly dangerous \"synthetic marijuana\" and \"bath salts\", however although on the same shelf, Kratom is far less dangerous and in fact has been doing its part to lessen the number of people using prescription drugs and/or heroin. \n\nMany users of the drug do so to manage pain, or overcome opioid addiction, whether it be from pharmaceuticals or a form of heroin. By placing Kratom into schedule 1, the DEA would be essentially making it harder for opioid addicts to quit. To put it into perspective, the CDC reports that in 2015, US poison centers received 263 calls relating to Kratom. In the year before, according to drugabuse.gov, over 25,000 people alone died from prescription opioids and over 10,000 died from heroin use. We simply cannot afford to take away a natural alternative to both prescription pills and heroin. \n\nBecause Kratom has shown potential to have an overall positively impact on society, I suggest it be placed into schedule 3 or lower so long as only minimal regulations are imposed. By minimal, I mean that nobody under 18 should be able to buy it and only Kratom that is correctly labeled (dosage, warnings, etc.) should be allowed sold. By scheduling the drug and allowing research, maybe one day will doctors be able to recommend its use to people who could benefit from it. \n\nThank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4258","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-10T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Spenser Sullivan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"This plant has helped me with pain for years, I don't see any threat that would make this scheduled.

My sales territory is half the state of Oregon and I'm in a hotel 4 nights per week while on the road servicing customers.  I've struggled with drinking since graduated college and starting my career.  It got to the point were I was drinking a pint of whiskey every night.\n\nI heard about Kratom on a podcast about 6 months ago and tried it a couple days later.  After a week of using Kratom I was able to cut off my drinking.  For the past 6 months I have consumed Kratom 5 to 6 days per week.  In the past 6 months I have drank only 4 times, which consisted of a couple beers, not the previous whiskey indulgence.  \n\nKratom has given me interesting results.  Thus far I have not experienced any negative results.  I would be curious to know what the effects are of long term use (i.e. 3 to 5 years or longer).  Kratom has lifted my mood and somehow removed the need or urge to drink.  My job performance has greatly improved and I feel much more balanced.  The drinking would give me short term relief (for the night).  Kratom seems to provide similar relief while allowing me to stay focused and effective.  I have also noticed that there seems to be no addictive repercussions while using Kratom.  I occasionally still have the urge to drink at the end of the day.  I force myself to have a glass of Kratom tea and the urge to drink quickly goes away.  I normally drink one glass of Kratom in the afternoon and have no urge to consume any more Kratom.\n\nI think it's very important the Kratom remains legal and available.  It would be important to conduct long term usage studies.  Again, in the last 6 months I have not noticed any negative side effects.  There is no doubt in my mind that Kratom is a far safer alternative to alcohol.  And from what I've heard people are using Kratom to replace much worse alternatives like pain pills and hard drugs.\n\nI really appreciate the DEA taking the time to read public comments like this and pray that Kratom will remain legal and available to those that are really benefiting from it's use.\n\nThank you,\nWayne","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12655","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Wayne ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Thank you for delaying the ban and being open to public comments. Kratom is from the same plant family as Coffee, and provides many excellent health benefits. Everyone I personally know who uses it are positively-benefitted from it, and we do not believe that it should ever become banned and classified as a \"Schedule 1\" drug. Please allow it to remain legal within all 50 states. It is not harmful like the dangerous street drugs, nor many pharmaceutical prescription drugs (which have many negative side effects). I almost died several times, and ended up in the emergency room to be treated by doctors after experiencing negative reactions to various types of  pills prescribed by my doctors. However, Kratom has never caused any negative side effects in my body, because it is natural, non-toxic and mild in potency (in small doses within tea). \n\nI have five severe spinal misalignments which were caused by work-related accidents many years ago, which require monthly chiropractor adjustments. This condition is painful 24/7, and at times triggers chronic insomnia where I get absolutely no sleep at all for consecutive days or weeks. Kratom tea is the only herb which helps me to function better with less pain, and likewise, to get the sleep my body so desperately needs. \n\nMany people I know have successfully stopped street and prescription drugs, and become free from all addiction by simply drinking one cup of Kratom tea every evening with dinner safely at home. This is an amazing natural medicine which our Creator God made for our benefit and blessing. I and many, many others all across the USA in all 50 states would be deeply grateful and thankful....IF you allow Kratom to remain legal. Please hear our pleas, and sympathize with understanding about our need to use it in wise moderation with self-control for medicinal purposes to effectively treat our negative health ailments, etc. ","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0968","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jonny Ray","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not list Kratom as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act.

It's definitely been given a bad name and it's nothing but a healer, a miracle plant from God, nature  in my opinion. I'm 36 now but at the age of 19 I was in a very serious car wreck that changed my world forever. I lost my mother and  also physically, emotionally, & mentally lost me. I'm on disability cause there's no way I could work. I have way more bad days then good. Never know from one day to the next how I'm gonna feel or how bad I'm gonna hurt. I've been on pain killers off and on throughout the years. From hydrocodone, methadone,  oxy's and even dilaudid. Nothing seems to work long enough though and always have to increase dose or it's just impossible to get a good caring doctor who actually thinks your life matters enough to even prescribe something for your pain. Addicts and junkies have ruined it for the ones truly in need just to live somewhat remotely normal lives. Well one day I posted on a chronic pain group talking about how much I hurt and how much I wanted to give up. That I failed my 4 kids as I spend most my life in bed or home not feeling well. Anxiety at an all time high. Well an amazing lady commented and asked if I have heard about kratom? I never had and was surprised as I have looked into pain remedies forever since that's all that's on my mind living with it 24/7.  So I decided to research this amazing herb and discovered it was something I wanted to try. I mean it couldn't be to bad it's apart of mother nature so I thought it's worth a try. The first time I drank my kratom tea I felt like a changed person. Truly it helped my pain, anxiety, sleep, everything. I could function completely fine as it doesn't alter your mind in anyway. Just helps you feel human. Like I can go on a walk with my dog, play with my four kids, do things I hadn't in forever. My kids noticed a change immediately. They know about kratom, it's a plant that I believe was put on mother earth to be discovered for its greatness. I don't believe it to be addicting like opiates and drugs but to comfort a person to live somewhat normal life. I much rather have kratom play a role in my life then depending on pharmaceutical drugs that have been dished out to me my entire life making me feel like a lab rat. I got many bad days still as fibromyalgia, anxiety, and severe chronic pain can be agonizing. But more better days. On my good days which are becoming more frequently I could even maybe imagine myself going back to some kind of non streness job at some point. I want to go back to work more then anything! I don't enjoy waking up everyday feeling lifeless. But with kratom it helps calm my anxiety, control or manage my pain, you can't overdose on it like drugs. When I heard it could be placed as schedule 1 I thought really? How? This herb/tea is not mind altering in anyway. Not like a high on drugs. Since I've discovered kratom I have lived and witnesses nothing but amazing  things. People managing there pain naturally. I see no reason to take it away. We should get to decide what we put in our bodies. As long as it's not hurting anyone else. This isn't it's helping thousands of people live somewhat pain free normal lives. Don't take that from us. People walking again who thought they never would. People waking up with hope . Since this threat as become present I have been a anxiety mess. I stopped 100% my dilaudid 1 month ago lost a good friend to a fentyal overdose. Kratom could have prevented that. Please take all of our comment letters to heart. Listen to what we have to say. I say kratom is changing lives and for so many. Let us live somewhat comfortable normal lives naturally and not on prescription meds forever. I'm tired of being sick and feeling like a lab rat stuffed with drugs that don't work. Do it for my kids, they need me to be a functioning human. With kratom I have hope for a better future. If it's taken I'm afraid I'm back were I started. Pretty much hopeless. I'm really trying to live without all the meds for once after 20 yrs. #IAMKRATOM!!!! SAVEMOTHEREARTH!!!!

At the time I was on a suboxone program, attended group meetings and met with a certified drug counselor twice a month. To be honest, the first time I tried it, I did not see any benefit. But this was almost completely because I was already taking suboxone and because it tasted absolutely awful. It wasn't until last year when I was not able to continue the drug program due to financial issues that I began look into the plant again. I detoxed off of a fairly low dose of suboxone, as well as the benzodiazepene Klonopin. For almost three months, I could hardly function. After the worst of the withdrawal eased up, I was still unable to get more than 3 hours of sleep per night, was extremely fatigued all day and suffered from very bad anxiety. \nThen, by sheer chance, I found a local convenience store selling (albeit very over priced) kratom in gel capsules. The company that manufactured these kratom caps, as I would later learn, was fairly reputable. When I purchased the kratom, I was mostly hoping for relief from the aforementioned symptoms of post acute withdrawal syndrome. But a small part of my mind was hoping for some type of high. Within 40 minutes of ingesting approximately 7 Grams of kratom, I experienced mild stimulation, different but on the same scale as what one would experience from a large cup of coffee. I also noticed a sharp lift in my mood as well as a sense of calm in my mind. I did not feel like I had taken some type of opiod, I just felt good and used this new productivity to do many chores, housework and continue my search for a good job. I can honestly say that kratom helped me pull my life together. I have been taking kratom on and off for the past 5 months. At no time did I ever feel dependent or addicted, especially not in the way I was to opiods. \nThis plant has shown in many anecdotal reports to alleviate pain, depression, anxiety as well as opiod withdrawal symptoms. Current data shows that only one death has occurred where kratom was the only substance in the individuals system, but even then the idea that a kratom overdose was what caused the death remains in question. Thousands of people benefit from kratom and it seems that potentially millions more could also benefit. The DEA should not schedule this plant in the same class as heroin or LSD, it would be just as large of a mistake as marijuana, which has caused no deaths ever through sole consumption alone, being scheduled. More research needs to be done before such a harsh measure should be taken. Scheduling kratom will only hinder the scientific and medical process, as well as put thousands of people at risk of either returning to prescription or illicit opiod drugs. It is in my opinion that there is more of a danger in scheduling kratom by possible rebound overdoses then there is of any toxicity through the plant alone. \nI hope you understand the mportance of this plant to so many people and simply leave it alone. \nThank you for reading. \nRegards, \nGreg Bernstein","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14673","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregory Bernstein","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \n\nI am a 57 year old man living in Chicago.  I have been using kratom for almost 3 years now.  First I learned about it from a piece that NPR was doing on it.  At the time,  I was dealing with a bad case of gout attack that lasted 9 months before it was under control.  I was taking Vicodin to take care of the pain.  I was not happy about taking it since I knew about the side effects.  I decided to give kratom a shot since the NPR program talked about the pain management properties of the plant.  It sure worked and I stopped taking vicodin.  Other thing that I noticed,  was that I could sleep better and didn't need sleep pills anymore.  \n\nAfter getting the gout under control,  I decided to keep on taking kratom to help with sleeping and minor arthritis pain.  Occasionally,  for different reasons,  I go for a day or two without it and I don't feel any  negative symptoms except for having a little less energy  which is not that bad \n\nKratom  gives me more energy during the day and relaxes me at night.  I used to drink wine for relaxation at night,  which is not good for my gout.  Using kratom in the evening,  I don't drink the wine anymore. \n\nOverall,  I feel that this herb,  is helping me live a healthier and happier life and I would be very unhappy and disappointed if it became illegal. \n\nThanks, \n\nAndre Rabbani","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1340","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andre Rabbani","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Firstly, I would like to thank the DEA for allowing these public comments to take place.  Using Kratom is an important choice that many citizens have made to better their lives.  It is an herbal supplement that is currently helping thousands, if not millions, of Americans, with a variety of issues, both physical and mental, and doing so in a remarkably safe manner.  It is far from a substance that deserves to be scheduled.\n\nI am a 32 year old male and have used kratom tea in the past.  At an early age, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia.  As I grew into my twenties, the symptoms started to get extremely bad.  At 26 years of age, I was spending upwards of 20 hours a day in bed, unable to have a job, or even go out and socialize.  I was simply not able to take care of myself.  I had been on multiple medications as prescribed by doctors, none of which were effective and many excacerbated my conditions due to the intolerable side affects.  That's not to say they aren't affective for anyone, just not me.  I truly felt that I would never be a functioning member of society which is all I ever wanted.  In desperation, I found kratom while searching the internet for natural remedies.  I bought some and tried it, even though I was hesitant to use an unregulated supplement.  I brewed it and drank it.  The feeling I got from it was subtle.  It was subtle, but it turned out to provide just enough of a sense of comfort in my own skin to allow me to take some positive steps forward.  Re-aquainting with old friends was first.  After awhile I decided that I was okay enough to go to college.  I enrolled in culinary school and  finished at the top of my class.  I got a great job as a chef in a restaurant that I love, where I still work to this day.  For the first time, I was entirely self reliant.  Kratom helped me with my issues enough to become what I never thought I could: a responsible, hard working, tax paying, member of society.  It did not cure my issues, it simply made them bearable enough to allow me to be able to do the things I wanted to do.  It is not addictive.  I used it for three years, daily.  When I had my life together, I decided I did not need it anymore, so I simply stopped, without a problem.  I consider coffee to be far more habit forming, but comparable to the effects and safety profile of kratom.\n\nRemoving kratom as an option for the people who are suffering will only lead to negative consequences.  It is not too far of a reach to say that any scheduling of kratom will lead to a lessened quality of life to those who need it the most.  This action will cause addicts to relapse onto harder, deadly street drugs, and will result in deaths.  People who use it for pain will either go back to unarguably more dangerous substances or go back to not being able to work.  In my opinion, during this opiate epidemic that is killing one person every 19 minutes in this country, removing a substance can could potentially solve this problem would be a disaster of a choice.  All I would ask is that the proper scientific analysis is done before a decision is made that would negatively impact he lives of millions of Americans.\n\nOnce again, thank you for allowing the public to speak on the important matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9416","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Petriello","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I don't understand why natural resources are constantly being threatened to be made illegal and people being told they cant take it, it's ridiculous. I personally dont take kratom but it's obvious that people benefit from it and that it has medical potential and to make it illegal would be silly. If the worry is that people could die from it then why not go after something like cigarettes that are packed full of chemicals that are known to be dangerous to ones health. If it comes out of the earth naturally no government should have a say whether a person should or should not take it. Additionally, I feel making this illegal would put an additional unnecessary burden on law enforcement when they could be used on more important violent matters instead of going after people for ingesting a naturally growing plant.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9598","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"David Esparza","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Chris and I work in the enterprise IT sector.\nI believe Kratom should absolutely NOT be scheduled as a controlled substance.\nI started using Kratom about 1.5 years ago when attempting to get off of prescription opioids. \n\nPrior to using Kratom, getting off of my medication was difficult, I frequently dealt with Post Acute Withdrawal symptoms (PAWS). As a result, I decided to research alternate methods to cope with the symptoms.\n\nAfter months of research on various research forums and .edu websites, I decided to attempt to use Kratom to wean myself off of my medication. When I first consumed Kratom (without my medication), the results were mindblowing. All of my PAWS were gone other than a runny nose. There was no noticeable cerebral change beyond a small boost in energy akin to a cup of coffee. \n\nI started off taking 16 00 sized capsules twice per day. Over the course of a month, I reduced my intake by 2 capsules per day until I was taking 2 capsules every other day. The last day of the month, I was off of my medication and Kratom as if I never took them. There were no urges to take more, and no cravings whatsoever.\n\nI didn't take Kratom again for 6 months until I sprained my wrist. I opted out of getting opioids, and decided to use Kratom instead. Since then, I have taken Kratom as needed for pain, but haven't touched any prescription opioids. \n\nI have relatives addicted to Heroin because of being prescribed absurd amounts of Oxycodone. I would love to help them quit with Kratom, but I'm afraid the potential legislation will make that impossible.\n\nPlease consider the benefits of this plant, look at the research, read the comments thoroughly, and talk to doctors and researchers prior to considering scheduling this plant again. I know many who benefit from its legality.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670991/","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5520","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"\nAfter battling a 7 year addiction to opiate prescription pain killers, I am clean, I am healthy, I have a new found outlook on life.\n\nI owe that to my family, my friends, AND Kratom.\n\n\nI nearly lost everything I love because of my addiction. 7 years ago i was diagnosed with lupus, and 7years ago I became addicted to pain killers. Over the course of nearly a third of my life I have done things I deeply regret. Things that I NEVER wouldve done sober. As an addict I take responsibility for my actions, but i have the upmost confidence that being addicted to a LEGAL drug had an impact on my decision making.\n\nThe pharmaceutical business failed me. \n\nI reached out for help with my addition, I was offered an alternative medication. This medication, Lyrica, nearly cost me my life.I was so deeply depressed I was hallucinating about my death and suicide. I was hospitalized for 3 days on suicide watch. After that, my ONLY option was to return to the drugs that my body so desperately needed for pain relief.\n\nThere is an alternative. This alternative is safe. This alternative has given my children back the mother that has been emotionally absent for 7 years, this alternative has returned my significant others partner and love of his life. \n\nA lot of hard word goes into being sober and maintaining recovery. Therapy, NA meetings, support from family, self awareness and honesty with yourself. The effects of physical withdrawals may last 1-4 weeks, but the effects of PAWS (Post Accute Withdrawal Syndrome) can last up to TWO YEARS. PAWS is accompanied by strong mental cravings for your drug of choice with can be brought on by triggers. Severe mood swings, periods of anxiety and depression. Therapy helps, and with that, Kratom helps control my cravings, is a mood elevator, and gives me the drive and motivation that I need to carry on day to day. It is not a crutch, it is not a replacement drug. It does not get you high. At one point people dismissed the benefits of Ginko Biloba, and now they are proven to be safe and effective.\n\n\nPlease take ex addicts, the depressed, the anxious, those of us who need this- our stories and experiences into careful consideration. The nation has spoken up, and we will continue to do so. The opioid epidemic has taken too many, too many have been lost through suicide. Do not limit those who need this.\n\n\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0180","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dee Sputnik","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not make Kratom a schedule I drug.

To claim that Kratom poses a risk to public health and has no medicinal value is pure fallacy.  Studies currently being conducted at several universities are showing the evidence of this, these studies need to continue. \n\nWe are currently experiencing a herioin and opioid epidemic in this country and there's wide public agreement that it needs to be addressed. So here, countless people are discovering this magic thousand year old plant from Asia that can help them quit herioin and prescription narcotics. It's not an opiate, does not impaire them the same way, does not have the same addictive qualities, and one  cannot overdose from it. It's saving lives. So the DEA wants to ban it?!  They state in the reasoning that people are using it as a replacement for herioin. The logic is mind boggling!\n\nWhen the  public at large learns the facts about this, public outcry will  be huge!  The \"war on drugs\" has been a failure.  This action is the exact opposite of what the American taxpayers want our government doing. If the DEA actually wanted  to help with the heroin and opiate epidemic, they would be promoting Kratom as a natural safe replacement for addicts. Because that's what this plant is. They would be encouraging the research, not trying to stop it with flawed logic!\n\nIn the past 5 years I have lost 3 people in my life to herioin overdose. I have also seen  with my own eyes people who have used Kratom to quit heroin and put their lives back together. I will continue to be vocal about this issue if the DEA continues with this extreme injustice to the American people.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20564","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Nick Fausnight, I'm a 21 year old software developer.

The DEA should be promoting research and medical testing of Kratom, as well as pushing to legalize Kratom in the states it is currently illegal in. I am a sufferer from chronic pain due to nagging wrist and shoulder injuries and surgeries. I refuse to take opioids to numb the pain due to their addictive properties. Kratom, a natural, nonaddictive plant that has been known to provide pain relief and even help ween addicted opioid users off of their drugs, has huge potential to help mankind. We are finally correcting the mistakes of our failed cannabis policy. It makes no sense to create another illegal market for a drug that can also help treat pain and suffering. Please do not repeat the mistakes of the past. We are marching toward a more enlightened future, where people don't have to suffer because of archaic drug policy.

Kratom is something on this earth that grows naturally. People are attracted to this plant for a reason, it's is natural and organic for a reason, it was put on this earth for a reason. And being that it is a plant, who are we to say that it's not allowed. It's really as simple as that, if it's helping people, then that is all that matters. Especially in a country where people die from opioids every 19 minutes. Addiction is something that is genetic, you are born with it, I've witnessed addiction within my family and there is no stopping it, but you can replace the specified addiction and I believe that there is a plant out there that can replace something that is causing self harm than it should be studied closer and be highly considered.

Unfortunately, these opioids come with all kinds of side effects, the worst of which were irritability and brain fog. In my work as a scientist, losing the ability to think clearly greatly hampered by progress on research and writing. I looked for alternatives to prescription drugs for pain relief and discovered kratom. Soon after starting kratom, I no longer needed the opioids, and given the new restrictions on opioids, I am unable to get prescription pain relief. I am very thankful that I can use kratom safely to reduce the pain without the irritability and brain fog associated with opioids. Kratom keeps me sharp, provides a sense of emotional well-being, and reduces pain. This plant has not been addictive for me - I have taken time off from it and suffered no adverse effects. I think more research should be done on Kratom, but it would be a disaster if the DEA scheduled it. Many chronic pain sufferers would be forced to obtain pain relief by other means. Kratom is not dangerous. It is a plant that has been safely used for millennia.

The idea that you would even consider banning something that has helped so many people and acted as an alternative to the man made medications with terrible side-effects that are currently pushed by doctors and TV ads is misguided and wrong. Kratom is not dangerous and does not pose a threat to public safety. We need to allow for research on Kratom as the combined qualities of this substance have endless possibilities in the field of medicine. The millions of people currently taking Kratom are not hardcore drug addicts and by using Kratom, allowed them to free themselves of opiates and other life destroying drugs that have reached an epidemic level. Prohibition does not work, we have seen that time and again. It is time to rethink our approach to addiction and by banning another substance that actually helps people off of the hard drugs is just poorly thought out and terrible policy. Treat people like personally responsible adults who are capable of making their own ddecision. Treat addiction as a public health issue and not a criminal one. Do not strip us of our liberties by taking the rights of the people away because there are a few bad apples. Throwing people in jail because of something they do to their own body is ludicrous. Kratom does not belong as a scheduled substance and if you've ever taken it you would know that, there are few other substances that are as safe as Kratom.

The DEA has failed to provide a medically/scientifically sound reasoning behind labeling Kratom as a controlled substance, such as incidences of overdose (there have been no reports of overdose resulting in fatality of the user) or injury related to the effects of Kratom on the human body. Just like any mind-altering substance, misuse is  heavily dependent upon the individual, not the labeling. Until the DEA can prove any harmful or life-threatening effects, Kratom should remain easily and lawfully available to those who depend on natural or herbal alternatives for pain relief while minimizing their risk for addictive behaviors. Kratom is innocent until proven guilty, one cannot presume it to be a dangerous substance simply because of the psychoactive ingredients.

So they took care of that problem and they send me home with hydrocodones 10ml. I took the pills for about a month maybe a little more.\nI didn't know anything about the pills, the only thing I did know was that it was taking my pain away. So when the doctors didn't gave me more refills I tried to stop but it was too late. I did some research about the pills and it turns out that  you'll get addicted to the pills. I ask my self why would a doctor give you something that you can get addicted to and make the problem worse.. I started looking for some signs of addiction and I had every single one of them. Depression, anxiety, couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, reality was a blur, Night sweats. It was horrible.\nIt took me awhile to find what could help me with the witdraws and the only thing it help was KRATOM, this plant save my life, it really did. It help me get my life back together, my withdraws were gone by the first 30 mins after taking KRATOM. My anxiety was lowered and my depression was almost gone.

After years of attempts to mitigate his pain, the doctors gave up and referred him to a pain specialist who began to just write him ever increasing dosages of opioid pain killers.

Its a derivative of the Coffee plant, and in my entire time researching the plant, I havent found a scientific study that suggests it has any negative side effects beyond those that can be attributed to many other, legal supplements. My father has successfully used this plant for over five years to mitigate (not cure) his pain to a level that has substantially reduced his dependence on opioid pain relievers  and he is just one of thousands to do so. Additionally, many others have used this plant to break addictions to pain killers and other drugs, which undeniably present a much greater risk of harm to the user.\n\nIf there were evidence that Kratom was dangerous, I would be the first to support your endeavor to criminalize this plant  but I dont believe such evidence exists.

I oppose any scheduling of kratom!\nI started consuming kratom about 18 months ago when looking for natural herbs and vitamins that could help me to feel better while quitting drinking. The reason I was looking for these natural herbs is because I have a severe alcohol problem that was destructive to myself and those around me. I had tried everything I could think of to stop drinking. I went to many 12-step groups (including 90 meetings in 90 days), years of therapy with multiple psychologist, psychiatrists and addiction specialists. I even tried prescription drugs designed to help discourage drinking or reduce cravings, such as Antabuse and Naltrexone. These things helped slightly, but I was still not able to give up drinking, despite my deep desire to stop. My addiction defied all logic. I was even in trouble with the law. No matter what the consequences, I simply could not stop!\nI have always known I was a good person, but I could not get away from the alcohol long enough to prove it. Alcohol had me hooked and I could not control my desire to drink. Because I am a determined person,  I started searching for unorthodox help since the conventional things I tried were not sufficient.\nI found kratom, along with many other helpful herbs, on a forum where people were discussing supplements and botanicals. Kratom, along with vitamin D, B-Complex and other herbs like Ashwaghanda, has been an invaluable tool for my sobriety. It helped me to get sober by giving me energy and a feeling of wellbeing I had never had before. It helps me to feel like a normal person, and that is all I want.\nI am not searching for a high. I live in a state where I can get alcohol or recreational marijuana if I wanted that. According to my definition of getting high, I do not get high from kratom, though I do feel better. It is hard to describe. It just makes me feel what I imagine is normal for many people. It helps me get on with the hard work of changing my life.\nI have been sober since July 14, 2015. I have not been sober this long since I was 17. By improving my energy levels and reducing the terrible pain I feel from my mental health problems, kratom has helped give me my life back and I no longer feel the need for alcohol.\nSince starting kratom, I have been a better student and have had the ability to keep a high GPA and even receive multiple academic scholarships. Kratom didnt do all of this for me. I still had to work very hard, but being able to stay sober and feel better made it possible to pursue my education and to fulfill my dream of working as a programmer. Because I have been able to stay sober, I am also a better mother, friend and community member. I have turned my life around in nearly every way!\nKratom is something that should remain available as a dietary supplement. I am not opposed to regulation. I think its good to have some standards in place, as long as those standards do not hamper people who need this herb for their continued wellbeing.\nIf kratom is taken away, I fear I may return to alcohol. Kratom does not replace alcohol for me, it just supports my sobriety. I only know that it works for me, and it has not caused me any addiction or unwanted effects. I have stopped taking kratom many times after long periods of daily consumption without having to worry about any serious symptoms other than a returning of the mental pain and craving for alcohol. Also, Kratom has many different varieties and it is important to me to be able to adjust the amount I take and the type I take based on how I am feeling each day. Kratom is an important part of a healthy life for many people in America. Please keep kratom available to all American adults who wish to use it.

When it came down to stop now or face life threatening consequences, I chose to stop. Against doctors orders I opted to quit cold turkey and face whatever obstacles were laid before me.  The shakes, severe anxiety, sweats, insomnia, weight loss and a drop in my immune system are some of the challenges I had to face. After a few weeks and still having a very difficult time adjusting to life without alcohol a friend suggested I go with them to an apothecary center and try some kratom to curb my symptoms.  While I had previously refused to go on any medication for fear of trading one for another I did some research and decided to give kratom a try. IT WORKED WONDERS. Whenever the symptoms got bad I took a teaspoon of kratom and they were generally curbed. It has now been three years since I quit drinking and still on occasion will use kratom for anxiety but have never felt any sort of dependency or negative side effect from the plant. I am confident that using kratom was a major factor in my ability to get through an otherwise extremely difficult and life threatening time. I know I am not alone in this experience and I truly believe that kratom can help others the way it has helped me.

At age 6, I had constant extreme headaches which led to CT Scans and X-Rays.  By age 7, I was diagnosed with Chronic  Migraines.  All I could do is cry and lie down in a cool, dark, quiet room.  I would always struggle and there was little that could be done. \n\nOne late night in March my life changed drastically. I was sick with a virus, which was causing me to cough real bad. I coughed so hard that I collapsed my right lung, requiring a chest tube.  At age 25 I was diagnosed with a rare lung disease called Blebs Disease, which consists of blisters on the lungs that can burst, causing the lung to collapse. I also suffer from painful Pleurisy episodes caused by the inflammation in my lungs. By age 27 my chronic migraines were so intense I would suffer from non-stop vomiting episodes.\n\nI was sent to pain management and prescribed very high doses of opiates.  After three years on pain management, I wanted to get off opiates because I wanted to try a new treatment. I wanted to be off opiates to have a clear mind so that I could determine if the new treatment was really helping.  I was having other issues on opiates such as weight loss. My weight loss was so severe on opiates my weight went from 140 to 104 pounds. So after three years in pain management,  I entered a detox recovery center and spent three days feeling very ill.  I honestly felt like I was going to die. I was sent home and spent weeks continuing to recover from unbearable withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAfter a year off opiates it became apparent to me that the new treatment was not working. I went back into pain management for a second time. I was prescribed large doses of opiates. After 13 months the Nurse Practitioner I had for several years decided to retire because of the current issues with opiates and prescribing. At my subsequent appointment the pain management office advised me they do not have any doctors who can prescribe pain medicine any longer; they could provided only therapy. All of us pain patients were told to go find another doctor or they could write Suboxone, which I could not afford. As a result, I went home to withdrawal and started detox, which was, again, beyond miserable. \n\nA few weeks later, with a different physician, I was prescribed a high dose of morphine and referred to yet another pain management clinic. After several visits with the pain management clinic, they advised that since their were no surgeries they could do and I am \"terminally ill\" they cannot help me and sent me back to the physician who had referred me. The next visit with the physician did not go well. He said he could write me one more morphine prescription but he cannot keep writing pain medication.\n\nFacing yet another painful withdrawal, I started to research opiate withdrawals and came across Kratom. Though skeptical, I went into a local shop that carried Kratom. I purchased a small amount and ingested the Kratom for 5 days straight. This time was different, this time I did not have the miserable withdrawal from the opiates. I also did not have the opiate craving any more.\n\n Kratom helps support my ability to remain clean of opioid drugs.  I also don't have withdrawal issues on Kratom like I did with opiates. If I take Kratom everyday for 3 weeks and then stop for a week I don't have withdrawal issue like on opiates. For over a year with taking the Dietary Supplement Kratom I have not had any side affects.  I also noticed If I stop Kratom I do not get ill and sick.  I still see my primary care doctor, a lung specialist,, and a psychologist.   I still have to take other medications for my Attention Deficit Disorder, Fibromyalgia, chronic nausea, and receive Botox injections for my chronic migraines. I just don't need the opiates that was causing me more problems than helping. \n\nWith taking the Kratom Supplement, seeing health care providers regularly, along with taking the right medications, I fell like I have my life back.  My weight is always above 130lbs now and people who run into me say I look much better. \n\nThe current opioid crisis has left doctors running and clinics shutting down. It feels so wrong to be shuffled from doctor to doctor because no one wants to deal with pain medications. I am a law-abiding citizen, who has a family and I just want a normal, pain-free life. Kratom has given my life  back. I play with my kids now, I am not sleeping all the time, and my weight is very healthy.  I do not experience euphoria or a high from Kratom, but it has given me the ability to remain clean of opioid drugs. \n\nPlease do not take this life saving, natural botanical supplement away, and please leave it a dietary supplement so any American can choose to use it if needed. It would be devastating and a tragedy to take Kratom away.\n\nSincerely from a concerned American Citizen,\nJason Edwards","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9609","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jason Edwards","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been on pills for years, I have decided to get clean and away from the Dr's and all the opiates they write.

I suffer from arthritis and degenerative disc disease, and I am often in pain as a result.  I have been on prescription drugs in the past, but I suffered many unpleasant side effects from them.  I researched natural alternatives to pain medication, and began drinking kratom tea in 2010.  I have been drinking this natural herbal supplement to help ease my pain ever since.  For me, it has been a harmless supplement that only helps ease my pain and improve my quality of life.  Before discovering kratom, I was also on a variety of anti-depressants and xanax, in addition to narcotic pain medications.  For me, weight gain was definitely a side effect of these prescription drugs.  Also, it's hard to exercise when you're in pain.  I gained 65 pounds because of the antidepressants, and have since lost 55 of that excess weight.  I do not want to go back to relying on these prescriptions that caused me so many bad physical and mental side effects. I have never experienced any negative side effects from kratom tea, nor have I ever experienced any type of \"high\" from it.  I have never experienced any withdrawals from kratom.   And I've gone days, even weeks, without drinking kratom.   It's been my experience that kratom must be less addictive than caffeine. I can go days without kratom when I'm feeling good, but I can never seem to skip my morning cup of coffee. So I'm at a loss when the DEA and other government agencies decide it should be banned. And when I recently read that 1 out of 7 people are now addicted to heroin and other narcotics, I worry about what will happen to all those people using kratom to help them get off of these dangerous drugs.  Overdoses and deaths may only increase. It's incomprehensible to me how a government agency, that was put in place to protect people, can plan to implement rules that will instead harm many of them.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14380","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I was first introduced to Kratom at a Kratom bar, all I knew about it was that it was a plant from Asia. My first experience trying it was disgust at the horrible taste of it but I am all for new experiences so I gave t a shot and after about 25 minutes or so, I noticed this pleasant buzz, almost like an alcoholic buzz but different. I was clear headed and it was relaxing. It quieted my usual social anxiety I deal with while out with friends and noticed I was much more comfortable in my environment and loosened up around my peers. I liked it enough to buy an ounce of it and for the next month it changed my daily life. I have back pain and some days I don't notice it so much but other days it's an immense burden, Kratom is awesome for those days, it's a natural pain reliever and I'm able to go about my day undistured by my back. I was quite shocked when I learned that the Drug Enforcement Agency was planning to categorize it as a schedule 1 drug. For me it is on the same playing field as caffeine, a drug that some people benefit everyday from. Prescription drugs that have a much much higher likelihood of becoming addicting can suck the money and souls out of everyday Joes, and this is a great natural alternative. I find that if I take a small dose in the morning I am more motivated for my job and am more productive everyday. Could be the Kratom or could be the placebo effect, I don't know, I wish there was more study's on the psycho active molecules of the Kratom plant. In conclusion, please don't take away my \"cup of coffee\", it helps me get through the day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3310","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephen Baker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I applaud the DEA's decision to not list Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine as schedule I drugs without first having public input.  The fact that 15 people nation wide have died when using these compounds is sad, however it pales in comparison to the tens of thousands of people who die each year in this country due to opiates.  It is also noteworthy that of the 15 deaths 14 of the people who died had other drugs in their systems, which tends to suggest that the real problem is the danger posed by mixing drugs; something that is hardly a new problem or unique to these compounds.  Many people find Kratom useful for pain management and as a way of breaking their dependence on opiates and alcohol, both of which cause vastly more deaths each year than Kratom.  It may be that Kratom needs to be regulated in some way, but the evidence does not support listing it as a schedule I drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0044","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeff Gillio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The DEA should stop any and all consideration of banning the herbal supplement\nkratom.

This would put kratom -- a plant consumed safely in the U.S for decades and world-wide for millennia, and one that helps millions of people -- on the same level as illegal drugs like heroin. \n\nThe DEA scheduling would also prevent further research which, to date, has shown the primary alkaloids in kratom to be beneficial without causing respiratory depression; the main cause of death from opiate overdose.\n\nKratom is a regulated dietary ingredient. Kratom is not a drug. Kratom is not addictive.\n\nI am a 37 year old Registered Nurse and have safely used kratom for one full year. I started using kratom after a friend told me how it helped ease her symptoms of chronic pain, fatigue, and depression. I use Kratom to ease those same symptoms as well as to ease my anxiety and insomnia symptoms. Kratom has helped me go from being nearly bedridden to functioning properly as a mother able to take care of a household, run errands, and attend doctors appointments and some social gatherings \n\nIn my opinion as a user and Registered Nurse, I feel kratom, a safe and completely natural supplement, should  remain legal and fully available to the public without restrictions. Kratom helps ease many symptoms that are chronic and acute and is a natural and safe alternative to opiods and other pharmaceutical medications used to treat pain and other conditions. Kratom does not cause respiratory depression or negative cardiovascular complaints and research to date shows no deaths resulting from kratom when used alone. \n\nIn conclusion I ask that the DEA and other governmental regulatory agencies keep kratom and its alkaloids legal and fully available to all individuals as a natural herbal supplement. \n\nThank you for your consideration and concentrated attention.

I have been searching for decades to find something that would work and have been prescribed many different medications. I currently take my prescriptions, which help, but don't resolve my problem. I have tried finding my own solutions by coming up with plans that I never followed through with or trying everything I read about that sounded like it may be helpful. Most things I tried were worthless. Some things I tried were helpful, but had side effects or the helpful effects were far too mild to help. I had heard of Kratom before and mentioned it to a friend years ago, but he had zero interest and I don't know anyone else who has ever tried it. I decided give it a try this year and i noticed some mild effects that I enjoyed and decided to keep using it. After several months of trying different kinds and amounts, I finally figured out what blend worked best for me and then I started to notice that my anxiety/depression were starting to become less and less pronounced and I was able to think about doing something productive, and then just get up and do it. This made me VERY excited. I had read about addiction potential and withdrawal symptoms and decided to experiment with cold turkey to see. Well, I can not go 24 hours without my prescribed medications without feeling hard withdrawal effects and other things I have tried have given me withdrawal symptoms within the same day of using it. However, with Kratom, I can go several days without any use and have ZERO craving and ZERO withdrawal symptoms. In fact, because of my consistent usage, the anti-anxiety and anti-depression effects seem to have made long lasting positive changes in me. Not being addictive to me is the most important feature for me to even consider it an option. Not causing me to \"get high\" or \"impair\" me in some way is the second most important feature. The noticeable effects just help alleviate my constant pains. The most powerful effect of being an anti-anxiety/anti-depressant isn't even noticeable until I think about something and realize I feel mentally capable of. It feels like it simply just makes my default gloom and doom thoughts, not be there by default. It doesn't prevent me from getting sad or upset in any way, it only removes a default feeling, which makes me feel initially neutral and able to view and think about things based on actual facts and situations and goals, rather than being always being defeated by impractical non-logical depressive thoughts that serve no beneficial purpose. If Kratom becomes banned, I will have to give up this miracle. If Kratom becomes a schedule medicine, I believe I will not be able to get the exact blend that I have used to help me. Kratom has changed my life. Kratom gives me hope and makes my goals become possible. I want to be a great person and help people and work hard and create things for people that bring people joy. I want to become independent and I don't want to be addicted to something that causes me problems. Kratom is my one and only solution. Kratom is saving my life. People have noticed a change in me for the better and now at my job I have become a cherished hard working employee that exhibits quality work. The thought of the DEA banning Kratom has devastated me. Please, I beg of you, don't ban Kratom. Kratom is not for everyone, but Kratom is for me.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Nutrition and Dietetics and am very health conscious I discovered kratom in an herbal formula shot that could be purchased at gas stations approximately 1.5 years ago, and after much research on this particular herb, it's effects, it's negative side effects, history, etc. I began to purchase this herb regularly in it's pure form to help a number of my mild ailments. The most important function of kratom in my life has been managing ongoing anxiety and depression without harmful pharmaceuticals. A close secondary effect is the pain management that is needed with my occupations and constant wear and tear on my body. Kratom has also restored passion in my life in creative areas that I had all but lost interest in due to depression. I have many friends that have been through rehab from addictions to heroine and prescription opiates that have used kratom to keep them from relapsing, and I have no doubt they would return to that horrible place if unable to acquire kratom legally. If you must schedule this herb as a controlled substance, I ask that you provide adequate reasoning that concludes pharmaceuticals are a safer treatment for such ailments as I have listed above than kratom. Considering the many side effects associated with almost every synthetic drug, and the few associated with kratom, I do no believe this will be evident.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17703","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Hunter Morgan","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'll begin by sending regards and best wishes to the fine ladies and gentleman that represent we the people. As you're probably aware, there's quite a stir in the air surrounding what I consider to be a Godsend, a miracle of nature and overall one of the most medically beneficial plants in the world. Yes, I'm referring to Kratom. As a hardworking American, born and raised in New York State, I'm proud to call this country my homeland. Unfortunately, everybody endures trials and tribulations in their brief time in this wonderful existence called life. These hardships are always emotional, mental, physical or some combination of all three, regardless of the issue at hand. What we have in Kratom, on the other hand, is an organic plant full of medical benefits that will eradicate the 'need' for most pharmaceuticals that are obviously creating a horrifying epidemic, not just stateside, but globally as well. The anxiety reducing, pain relieving, mood boosting effects of Kratom, just to name a few, are far reaching, can be proven, are legal and it needs to stay this way. It will require joint effort from the hardworking folks in the world, the disabled who will certainly benefit from Kratom and all of you, our passionate, hard working representatives to the government. On a personal note, I've a few old injuries that resurface from time to time, I've had insomnia at different stages of my life and generally could use a mood/energy boost occasionally when all else fails. Knowing that I'm not alone, I urge you to help make DEA see the same light as me and if it takes research and regulation, so be it. But to me, well I'm free and so should Kratom be.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15450","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kolby Andrews","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Having chronic pain, Kratom took me off the addiction of Oxycodone and successfully took me off the narcotics and now I only have to take Kratom 2x at 5 grams as opposed to 30mg x 4 of Oxycodone and 10x 2 Oxymorphone.

Personally i have always cultivated this plant for it's ascetic beauty and appearance and don't feel that growing this plant should be considered a crime. There are far more harmful things that are legal to grow such as the actual papaver somniferum which unlike kratom is an actual opiate.... Growing plants should not be considered a crime, Especially when they are not directly linked to deaths and are being used as a medicine saving 100s or even thousands of lives... To me it seems as if lobbying from a few large pharma companies who want to push similar more harmful substances is the driving force behind this political action and personally I feel that that's just wrong.. This is not what our taxes are for, Nobody is voting on this, Nobody is dying from this... The people don't want a ban... please don't use unconstitutional powers unjustly given to the DEA to take medicine from people who need it and a beautiful houseplant from people who enjoy growing it. In the end the only people who will benefit from a ban are the people trying to push synthetic opiates on the country.... People will loose their lives because of this ban...

It doesn't hurt my stomach like the 800mg ibuprofen I was taking every 4 hours.  I still have pain, but I can get out of bed and go to work thanks to kratom.  If it is made illegal, it will negatively impact my life.  I will either have to get a prescription for opiate painkillers, or stop working and apply for welfare.  That is not as serious as the negative impact it will have on recovering addicts.  The opiate epidemic, as you know, is taking so many lives.

In reading through many comments, I see those attesting to the value (though empirically under-analyzed) of kratom for treatment of chronic pain, especially considering the addicting, disruptive, and harmful alternative of opioid medication. I do not share this experience, however, though I believe that it alone is sufficient to suspend an intent to schedule kratom until more conclusive data arrives. \n\nMy experience involves being a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, where I also teach undergraduate courses.

Doctoral programs are often labeled as programs of \"psychological warfare,\" testing just how much a student is capable of enduring. \n\nTherefore, I have turned to kratom (moderately and intermittently) to manage extreme periods of stress, particularly during my previous Ph.D. examination, in addition to intense periods of research, writing, and publishing. In four years in the program, I have suffered no ill effects or side effects from kratom. In addition, when I go on vacation, for example, I do not bring my kratom with me. Several weeks go by without any kratom use, and without any physical or psychological addiction. In my experience, and in the experience of the vast majority of other kratom users, kratom is a relatively harmless drug with mild but valuable effects. Kratom does not impair my judgment, state of consciousness, focus, or motor skills. In fact, it is precisely kratom which, during these extreme periods of stress, calms my mind and facilitates momentary rest. \n\nYou might wonder why rely on kratom for such effects. Why not learn to do without? Surely, it is doable. Let me provide an analogy. During extreme periods of work, I rely on coffee to sustain my focus, intensity, and dedication to my projects. I am not addicted to coffee, nor is it impossible to do work without it, but coffee provides an assistance that is invaluable, and since moderate use comes with no ill effects, it seems rational and beneficial to accept what it can offer to me in certain situations. \n\nThe same goes with kratom -- expect that instead of utilizing kratom to work, as I do coffee, I utilize it to shift my concentration from work to rest. As you know, kratom and coffee are related species, and offer similar effects depending on dosage. In this sense, I believe moderation is the key, as both species may have negative effects to health with immoderate use. \n\nKratom, however, has not been demonstrated among its five million users in the USA to have either the psychological or physical effects (in terms of health and state of mind) as schedule I drugs like heroin or LSD. Furthermore, as you are aware, research on kratom has significant potential to alter the course of opioid addiction, which kills many thousands more than the few who have died from kratom in relation to use of other drugs. \n\nFor this reason and many others, I would ask that you sustain kratom's availability, thereby sustaining active research in the field, as well as sustaining an alternative to opioid addiction for the public. I ask that you trust the general public (despite inevitable cases of misuse and abuse, though small in comparison with most any other drug) to regulate their use of the drug, and to consume moderately. However, I understand that regulation in the future from the FDA would be a wise action. I simply ask for time. Rather than temporarily scheduling kratom, I ask that you temporarily sustain its availability so that further research can be done. I am aware that the research on kratom is inconclusive and often anecdotal, as is my testimony; on the other hand, this limited research does not discount the apparent promise of kratom, and the multitudes of anecdotal evidence from users is quite promising in and of itself (not including specialists in medicine).\n\nConsequently, if kratom even has a remote possibility to facilitate many of the problems that many in medicine (and the general public) state that it can, I believe it is truly worthwhile to sustain kratom's availability, even if temporarily.\n\nThank you. I appreciate your time and consideration, and for creating this opportunity for what has hopefully been a professional public discourse on this important and consequential matter. I anxiously await your response and trust in your decision for the good of the general public and for our medical institutions.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-6880","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ryan Leack","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"With all the drugs and problems in our society Kratom is not in that mix.

Prior to consuming Kratom I was on numerous prescription medications, all of which had horrendous side effects. I took antidepressants, pain medicine and anti anxiety medicines. I was either sleeping too much, or, did not sleep at all. I was in constant pain because I grew a tolerance to my opiate prescriptions, and my anxiety was getting worse as I got older. My ailments were controlling my life, and in the process, I was miserable. I wanted my life back, without all of the prescription medications. I decided to take a more holistic approach, and that is when I started researching Kratom. I read thousands of testimonials raving about it's medicinal benefits and quality of life improvements. I decided to take a chance and purchased a small amount of Kratom. Honestly, I did not have high hopes for it. I was skeptical and thought, if this herb is so useful, why hasn't my Dr. ever heard of it? \n\nI initially started consuming Kratom for my TMJ joint pain, to get off of my pain medicine. By happy coincidence it relieved most of my anxiety and depression as well. I couldn't understand why this wasn't better known, or even suggested by my Dr's. The combination of Kratom and my weekly therapist sessions made me into a new person, the person I always wanted to be. I have more energy to enjoy the things I love, like walking. I have more motivation to work on creative projects for my stores. Within just 3 months of consuming Kratom I became a new and better version of myself. My sales started to sky rocket, my friends noticed a positive improvement in my mood, and most importantly, I feel wonderful and am no longer in constant pain. None of this would have been possible without Kratom. I am now able to go to social events without having a panic attack, I am able to cope with whatever life throws at me without having a major depressive episode. Kratom accomplished what combined prescriptions could not, and I am grateful that I found it. \n\nKratom is not a drug, it is a dietary ingredient that has no addictive qualities. It is miracle that Americans have access to something so life changing that is totally safe to consume. Something that has no side effects, no addictive properties, and best of all, no harmful substances put into our bodies. I will never again take harmful pills when Kratom is readily available. In a country that suffers from so many addictions, so much pain, so many mental ailments, it is a god send to have an herb that not only can replace opiates and other prescriptions, but can also help addicts get clean. Why would anyone want to abolish such an amazing opportunity to turn their life around? Please, allow scientists to research it further, to prove to you that is as safe as we all claim it to be. The U.S.A has a serious opiate epidemic, and this could be our way out, a way up for so many people who have been down for too long. A way through their withdrawals, a way to get their life back together. \n\nThank you so much for your time,\nAmy White","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9914","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy White","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I'm 46 and live a very healthy lifestyle including regular exercise, eating organic fruits and veggies daily, drink 2-3 glasses of red wine per week and do not smoke.  I've been financial and insurance planning consultant for over 20 years.  I have two children who are the light of my life.  \nI was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 24.  Although the depression/anxiety has not been debilitating, I have certainly struggled mightily coping with both over the years.  I've taken SSRI's and have managed to maintain an active and successful career. However, not without multiple side effects such as tiredness, low libido, decreased excitement and increased social anxiety.\n\nFor two years I've coped with a severe neck and right arm pain  My doctors cannot identify the cause.  Just a pinched nerve they say.\n\nI began taking Kratom one year ago after studying it and reading so many positive testimonials.  My 76 yr old mother suffers from a back condition called Ankylosing Spondolitis and takes Tramadol but doesn't get any relief from the debilitating pain.  The Tramadol is greatly effecting her memory.  She knows this because the symptoms go away when she doesn't take it.  Admittedly, beginning the Kratom regimen for myself was also an experiment with her in mind.  We have relatives who became addicted to opioids and their lives were changed for the worse so she and I have no desire to take them.\nI take approx 5-8 grams of Kratom per day and am amazed at the results. My neck pain has been decreased by 90% and is now manageable.  I sleep better as a result. My social anxiety and depression issues are markedly better.  I have even stopped taking Wellbutrin since it made me jittery with little benefit.\nI do not \"get high\" using Kratom.  It merely makes me feel normal, positive and attentive.  Much like a cup of coffee with milk and hope!\n\nMy hope was to help my mom by introducing her to Kratom.  That all changed on Oct. 1st as I did not want her to get great results but then not have access to Kratom.  I hope and pray that my mom can try  Kratom regimen for her AS.  She has always been a highly active and community oriented person.  Her daily pain is restricting her from exercise and dance which she loves.  With the temporary legality of Kratom, she will likely be interested in giving it a try, especially since its natural.  She will have her own story to share soon.\n\nAs for me, Kratom has dramatically increased my daily energy, positivity and attention.  I've never had a bad experience or hangover- unlike with eating wheat or drinking alcohol which both wreak havoc on my body.  Again, I do not experience any kind of high from Kratom.

Although she survived - bearly- she spent the next  7 years in and out of Massachusetts General Hospital. Multiple surgeries and installation and removal of hardware left her with permanent, unresolvable physical issues and was told that she would be in pain for the rest of her life. She has been under the care of a pain clinic and has faithfully followed the advice and direction of her very qualified, very compassionate doctor, but there is very little he has been able to do to make her pain and her life bearable. This constant agony prevents her from having any quality of life. She cannot sleep, stay in any position for any length of time. She is exhausted and do to lack of sleep is depressed. She can't participate in life. Can't sit in the car for very long, so she rarely goes out and when she does, the effort to deal with the pain of moving is not worth leaving her home. This leads to isolation which contributes to the depression. It is a vicious cycle with no relief ever. I don't know how she does it and am frequently afraid that she will end it all, due to the fact that there is no hope. She hates the side effects of pain meds which provide her with minimal relief but are her only option.\nThen along comes her discovery of Kratom, which has changed her life. It helps her pain so she can sleep. She can move, she can leave her home and participate in life. Her mood is elevated and she is upbeat and hopeful for the first time in 15 years. She can play with her 4 year old, whereas before it was too painful for her to sit him in her lap! She is smiling and laughing again. Kratom has also changed my life as well. I have my daughter back! I don't worry all the time and spend countless sleepless nights trying to figure out a way to help her. I have prayed for a miracle for many years.

I spent 10 years of my life in hopeless addiction, during which time my life spiraled out of control and I had several brushes with death. I entered recovery with the help of an anonymous group and was able to make it to almost 4 years free from any narcotics. During that period of sobriety, I came to realize that I had untreated anxiety and depression disorders for which I had been self medicating most of my adult life. Around 4 years sober, the untreated emotional disorders had grown and were causing so much despair that I had been considering suicide to get relief. I began using presciption narcotics again to escape from the despair, even though I did not want to. Around this time I was introduced to Kratom. I noticed that, when I would take Kratom, my need to use presciption opioids would completely disappear, but that I didn't feel \"high\" and was able to live a normal life. I stopped using opioids completely and began taking Kratom. I noticed that, while taking Kratom, my depression and anxiety symptoms were greatly lessened. I could not believe that a very mild plant was able to help me to live a normal and healthy life. Kratom was a Godsend for me! I was able to get my life back and I was also able to seek help from medical professionals for my emotional disorders. I was put on Zoloft, which has also worked wonders for my conditions. I am now able to live a happy, fulfilling, productive, normal life with the help of Kratom, therapy, and antidepressant medications. I know that it I had never found Kratom that I surely would have overdosed and died several years ago. If the DEA schedules Kratom, it will prevent so many addicts from receiving the healing effects of Kratom. During a time when deaths due to opioids are at an all time high, I can not sit by and let that happen. I owe Kratom my life.

I found Kratom during my sophomore year in college while searching for herbal alternatives to coffee since i find that caffeine raises my anxiety.  Although my anxiety is a very small part of my life and only surfaces itself in rare occasions, i have found that kratom allows me to get my work done with a clear mind and no jitters or anxiety.  Kratom, in its raw form, is incredibly safe for the general public.  There are very few companies that took advantage of kratom and used them to mask the fact that they were actually selling research chemicals that had not been criminalized by the justice system yet.  It is a shame to see people take advantage of such an amazing plant.  Because of kratom, i am able to stay healthy and away from any dangerous pharmaceuticals. I also have a friend of mine who just recently went through chemotherapy due to breast cancer, and she was given so much oxycodone that she was dependent on it before she was even done with the chemotherapy.  I told her about Kratom and she utilized it to get off of the oxycodone without any withdrawals, and now uses kratom for her pain instead of oxycodone.  It would be incredibly sad and useless if kratom was scheduled.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who use kratom responsibly, and even though a minuscule amount of people have been injured abusing kratom, it would be overly aggressive and downright wrong for the DEA to ban it for the rest of us.  I hope that the amount of feedback this issue receives allows for a better decision to be made.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4047","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-08T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Corey Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"The real tragedy here is that good folks who are using kratom to manage chronic pain (like my grandmother with fibromyalgia) will be forced on to opoid painkillers.

It has completely changed my life for the better. I have served in the United States Navy, commercial fished in Alaska and have spent over  a decade in warehouse work(hard labor). All of which has taken a toll on my body. The amount of pain I was living with, on a daily basis, was hindering my work performance, confidence and my motivation, which caused depression and anxiety. I am now a self employed handyman. No insurance and very little money for medical help. I had turned to marijuana, alcohol and the occasional prescription pain pill to lighten the amount of pain i was experiencing. A pain specialist introduced me to Kratom at a point in my life where I was considering giving up. I felt like my body had been given back 10 years. I had initially started taking Kratom for pain relief. Before I knew it I found myself happier, more confident, energetic, and no longer using alcohol, marijuana and pain pills. I have, in my younger days, taken drugs recreationaly. Kratom did not effect me like most other drugs. No buzz,  no withdrawal symptoms, no hangover, and no criminal activities involved in acquiring it. Coffee is too harsh on my system, Kratom gave me a boost similar to caffeine. Since first consuming Kratom the first time, I've  had to teach myself and learn from other's own experiences as to how it should be consumed, as there is not enough research on it along with the FDA's claim of it having no medicinal value. In my opinion, the only reason for the ban is to help the pharmaceutical companies regain their prophets from costumers who have found Kratom more healthier for their bodies. It must have some value as there are patents on the make up of this leaf. With my distrust for the DEA, FDA, and pharmaceutical companies, I bet just after the ban they will start selling a product derived from this plant so they can control yet another part of our lives. Kratom has helped myself and at least 7 iindividuals, that I know, live a happier, healthier life, if not saved it completely.  I believe Kratom should be available to whomever is in need of it, without obstruction from those who wish to gain by its criminalization.

It's exhausting. Try it: sit there with your abs flexed while you finish this letter.

A friend of mines co-workers son was taking red leaf Kratom for his pains of having lyme disease. She knew I've been in search for relief so I looked into it. I am very skeptical these days on what I put in my body. Organic and as natural as possible, no man made medications for me. \nIn deeper research I saw the connection between \"Brain and Gut\" (give it a google, it's some interesting facts on how the two are connected) But did you know that 80-90% of your serotonins are created in your gut? And those are sent to the brain. If your gut is disrupted, than so are your serotonins, and thus the brain sends out haywire signals and the nerves assume attack on the body and hence, the nerves are on flight-or-fight mode constantly (in me). \nDid you know Kratom enhances your serotonin receptors? The green leaf is used to help stable mental health and ween people off behavioral drugs. \n\nNeedless to say, I am ecstatic to say I feel pain free for the past month. Over joyous. I can feel like a normal person now over a leaf! Why the DEA would mark this as a schedule 1 drug is beyond me.

I used Kratom during rehabilitation from a serious physical injury to responsibly balance pharmaceutical pain relief and natural pain relief, to continue to be a productive, contributing member to our community and economy. As I'm sure you're all aware, there is a epidemic of opioid abuse in our country and especially in my home state of North Carolina.\n\nKratom is not an opioid, but provides light pain relief without the possibility of real addiction or abuse.\n\n- It is in the coffee family, and has very similar behaviors to ingesting coffee. Imagine your first cup of coffee in the morning - the first few sips have the greatest effect. However, if you continue to drink more there are diminishing returns on it's effect. Eventually if you drink a few cups you actually become tired and experience the opposite of the desired effect (due to dehydration).\n\n- The above point is important in understanding Kratom, because the more Kratom you take, the less effective it is, to the point of being useless. This is actually a very good thing because it makes Kratom almost impossible to abuse.\n\n- Kratom can be used as a powerful tool to help opioid abusers withdraw from their addictions because it provides legitimate pain relief, and can fill the void to decrease side effects of withdraw. Kratom is your ally!\n\nWe are banning the cousin of coffee over misunderstanding and lack of evidence.

I was very active before finding out my hip pain that I was getting was avascular necrosis. I am trying to put off surgery as long as possible due to the wearing out of replacements, making me need many surgeries in my life time. Not wanting to become addicted to narcotic pain medication, I tried to deal with my pain by resting and physical therapy. A few months of that, I had worsening pain to the point of being unable to walk many days. I was searching for a natural pain reliever at that point. I had talked to several people who had used kratom for everything from surgery recovery without narcotic medications to severe chronic pain for spine issues. I figured I would give this a try. Then I saw that it would be scheduled soon. I didn't want to find potential relief for it to become illegal in a few months. Once the scheduling was extended I decided to try it for myself. Since the first very small amount I had taken, my pain went from being at a 8-10 most days down to a 0-2 while taking kratom. I am able to now walk with a cane and go out while being in next to zero pain. Being able to go out and not being in blinding pain when I move has helped so much with being depressed. I feel like I have been given my life back. Even when the kratom wears off, there is no rebound pain like I have found with opiate pain medication. There is actually less pain than normal even as it wears off. My pain might peak at a 5-6 now on bad days before taking kratom. I have experienced positive effects with no side effects even remotely comparable to opiate pain medication. I have also discussed my taking kratom with a person who worked in drug and alcohol treatment and they said that I don't seem intoxicated in any way. I hope you do not schedule this on a knee jerk reaction because of the abuse of kratom by a few people and make people who are using this as a therapeutic treatment for  chronic pain criminals or become hooked on narcotics. This country should be happy that people have found a means to manage pain without pain medication as it has become an epidemic of abuse throughout all socio-economic classes of our country. Kratom is a way for people to get their life back. Please don't take away a life changing plant from the Americans who suffer from debilitating pain and addiction. This, in my opinion, is a much safer alternative to narcotics as well as even alcohol. Let people make the choice to help themselves.

All the drugs prescribed for my bipolar disease have failed miserably to control my anxiety problems.  Big Pharma has nothing that can help without costing an arm and a leg and the side effects are worse than the disease.  I take one 900 mg capsule of Kratom in the morning and my mood is improved substantially and I experience no anxiety for about 8 hours.  As a bonus, my lumbar pain is reduced substantially and I have much more energy and am more productive.  I had a son that died from an overdose of Oxycontin, and I refuse to let Big Pharma kill me a bit at a time with the use of such drugs.  I can drive and work with no adverse side effects whatsoever while taking Kratom.  2,000 years of use with proven effectiveness and now without a reasonably thorough study of its effects on the general public, you simply declare it without any merit.  All you will do is create a black market for Kratom and then you get no assurance that the public are ingesting safe products and at the same time, not collecting the sales taxes, increasing the cost of government policing and turning good law abiding, tax paying citizens into people who can not get good jobs so subsequently they pay much lower taxes.   I would think the government would like to maximize the taxes collected by making people more productive and have more money to buy products other than pharmaceuticals.  Back alleys are no safe place to buy a proven, non-habit forming natural herbal substance.  Please reconsider your attempts to imprison the public in a cage of pain and depression. Tobacco, alcohol and even sugar are addictive and lead to horrible diseases.  Remember the damage done by prohibition of alcohol on society and you are willing do it all over again just because of a few addictive personality citizens abuse the use of Kratom?

I am 26, and I have been taking a low dose (2g) of kratom for nearly one year. I take kratom because of my Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which developed suddenly 4 years ago. In a typical day, I become paralyzed with fear when confronted with casual social situations. This often keeps me at home by myself or with my girlfriend more often than I'd like. \n\nI've suffered measurable damages to my social and professional life, as well as my sense of self-worth and optimism for my own future because of my anxiety.\n\nThe first time I took kratom was the first time in several years in which I felt back to my old self, the one I knew before anxiety. I have tried a number of prescribed medications, recommending meditation practices, and lifestyle changes in an effort to combat my anxiety. Some of these medications have had disruptive and uncomfortable side effects. This is not the case with kratom. \n\nKratom does not get me high. This is especially true for me, considering the low dose that I take. It does little more, honestly, than alleviate my anxiety. I am not sure what I would do if I was unable to treat my disorder with kratom. Every other treatment I've tried has not only been ineffective, but some have even been harmful to me. \n\nI am not a user of illicit drugs. I don't even like drinking very much.

My boyfriend told me about the herb and that it was an energizer that made you feel calm at the same time. He said he originally bought it at GNC but they had stopped selling it. He said he saw a neon sign in a smoke shop for Kratom and started purchasing it there. I tried it thinking it was some natural healthy herb and mixed it into a smoothie and soon after noticed I felt very weird. I tried it a couple other times and got extremely nauseaus one of the next times I tried it. Still wanting the positive effects,  I had taken it a few more times but started noticing unwanted effects at times such as paranoia and other somewhat psychotic effects especially when combined with alcohol. Even more so, I noticed that I started wanting to take it more and more for the positive effects which included somewhat of a euphoric state and a very happy and intense feelings. When I mentioned my concerns to my boyfriend, and that I had concerns over the herb he agreed with me. Thereafter, he started hiding his usage of it somewhat of it from me and also increasing his intake. Basically, he was taking it all day long and spending about $60+ a week on his habit. One of the main things I noticed is that the effects are not the same from all vendors.  There is one smoke shop in particular where the product seems to have much more of the \"high\" effect. This is a concern considering that I have read reports of Kratom being tainted with other substances. Bottom line, I believe Kratom is a pleasure inducing substance that I have felt and seen in others to be addictive. I have seen adverse psychological effects of it when combined with alcohol. At a minimum I believe it should be regulated and monitored.

I have herniated discs in my neck and back from a car accident in 1992.  I also have scoliosis in which the curve pushes on the herniated discs in my back causing almost continuous pain.  In 1998 I was diagnosed with Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis.  I also have a bad knee from a sports injury as a teenager needing yet more surgery.  I have arthritis in my neck and in my large toe so bad it no longer bends.  I will always be on Plaquenil to keep my lupus under control as much as possible as sadly there is no cure for lupus.  For pain I have been on Corticosteroids (steroids like prednisone), anti-inflammatory drugs (Naprosyn or ibuprofen), pain meds (Vicodin, Vicoprofen or Percocet), muscle relaxers (Flexeril) and sleep meds (Lunesta or Ambien and/or trazodone) for many years. While the pain meds helped at first it never completely handled all the issue plus it came with side effects. I refused to take any RA biologics (like Enbrel or Humira) or cancer drugs (methotrexate) which are the only options for arthritic pain. In September of 2010 I was laid off from my job of 10.5 years.  My insurance would be ending at the end of the month and Cobra was not a viable option being on unemployment I could no longer afford to go to the pain doctor. I struggled daily and continued to use only ibuprofen for pain. I was miserable and spent the majority of my time either in bed or on the couch. Most people know people with lupus are in pain but another thing you battle is extreme exhaustion; 24/7/365 non-stop exhaustion.\n\nIn June of 2012 a friend of mine brought over some all natural pain medicine she got from a chiropractor.  This friend was in a horrific car accident and deals with lots of pain daily.  Nothing had really helped her but this did and therefore she wanted me to try it.  She had gelatin capsules filled with Mitragyna Speciosa better known as kratom.  I tried the (capsules) to humor her. I was expecting nothing but I was amazed! My back did not hurt. My neck did not hurt. My toe did not hurt. I also noticed I had more energy. With kratom I was able to do basic chores for more than 10 minutes at a time.  I ordered myself some of the capsules and that was the beginning of my kratom \n\nI started to do more and more research on kratom.  I read lots of great things about people who took it for various reasons; chronic pain, energy, MS, RLS, depression, diarrhea, insomnia, diabetes and opiate withdrawal.  I joined groups and forums to talk to others using this wonderful plant. I learned about the different strains that offer different results.  Some are more stimulating, others more relaxing.  I read anything I could find on kratom be it good or bad.  Throughout reading the information a pattern became obvious.  People who were taking kratom said wonderful things about it. Things like how much it has helped them and changed their quality of life. However, the FDA and mainstream media say something completely different.  I would like to say that they are some inaccuracies but that would be an understatement.  Fallacies would be the correct term. Here are some examples.\n\nKratom gives you heroin like high.\nFALSE. You do not get high from kratom.\n\nKratom is dangerous and you can overdose.\nFALSE. You cannot overdose on kratom. If you take too much kratom you will get nauseous. If you really take too much you will throw it up.\n\nKratom is highly addictive and you will go into withdrawal without it.\nFALSE. Ive used it on and off for over four years and I have never had any withdrawal symptoms. \n\nWhat you WILL notice when you stop taking it is how much it was helping you.  As for side effects, the only one I have ever had is some constipation. To alleviate that you need to drink lots of water and eat fruits and veggies. All things we should be doing anyway.\nMost days I have my pain level is low.  I have energy again.  I am able to do chores, go grocery shopping and even some light yard work.  At night I am able to relax and sleep without pain and without drugs. My blood work is the best it's ever been. My rheumatologist (at the Cleveland Clinic) is aware I use kratom & turmeric and is amazed at how well Im doing.  Someone recently asked me to describe my life with kratom.  I said with kratom I feel normal again.  I am able to participate in my life instead of watching it go by.  What an amazing feeling that is.  I was even able to go back to work which I never thought possible.  If I lose kratom my life will again consist of me either in bed or on the couch. THAT is not a life.  I can't believe the DEA wants to force me back onto opiates (and other meds) when this plant works better.

I used kratom to ween off of an addiction to pain killers. I figured by going to a doctor that prescribed suboxone and/or methadone it would be a good idea to help me to quit.  From my experience, suboxone was a bad experience, I would never take it again. It was worse coming off suboxone than the pills themselves.  It took months to recover and I had to quit my job, I was so sick. That's when I found out about kratom. I used it to help with the withdrawals coming off prescription drugs. It was the best thing I had found to help turn my life around. The herb is really beneficial and could help millions of struggling americans!I have since started a new job as a machinist running CNC machining center's. I have perfect attendance and my life is getting better every week. Kratom saved my life. Please don't make this wonderful herb illegal. Maybe you could add an age restriction of 21 or older. I believe as an American adult,  I should have the freedom to choose to buy kratom. I have since quit using kratom because I don't need it anymore but a lot of people could benefit from the plant. It's really mild like coffee and I consider kratom non addictive at all. I quit with no problems whatsoever. I don't think kratom needs to be regulated by the government! It's not bad like you think, It's the opposite. I truly believe that no person's have died as a result of ingesting kratom. That's not possible at all.

After trying many times to quit I finally enrolled in a suboxone treatment program. I found that not only was suboxone therapy incredibly expensive, but it was also much harder to quit than the original addiction I was looking to stop. I finally found out about kratom, a natural inexpensive alternative to suboxone. Within a few months I had quit taking my suboxone altogether. A few months after that I stopped taking kratom with almost no negative side effects. I still use kratom on occasion as do many other people I know. I also know many people that are where I was so many years ago in the depth of opiate addiction and have, to their relief and astonishment, gotten them to use kratom to ease opiate withdrawal. Aside from the social benefits of being able to buy an efficacious, inexpensive and natural means by which people can kick their opiate addiction kratom allows people to avoid the stigma of joining an opiate treatment program. \nPersonally, this is all irrelevant though. My main concern is with any governmental agency banning personal use of a substance without providing ample evidence that its legal availability is more dangerous than another black market. The burden of proof should be on you, not the public. I would ask for consistency from the DEA and FDA. If you find evidence that kratom is harmful to the user, then ask if it's more harmful than cigarettes, alcohol or McDonalds. We don't need anymore arbitrary rules to criminalize people. We also don't need to get rid of a life saving alternative to prescription opiates and heroin in the midst of the epidemic of use we now see. \nThank you,\nAnthony Cantrell","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-4120","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-09T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony Cantrell","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, \n\nMore research should be done to determine the effects and benefits of this substance.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11226","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jaramillo Jaramillo","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have seen many of my friends greatly benefit from the pain relieving properties of kratom, and I have seen it help people with addiction issues.

I had a severe injury when I was 18 years old. Up until that point I had never tried a single drug in my life, never smoked a cigarette, never even drank a beer. I was very straight edge and anti drugs. In fact, I looked up to the DEA, believing that they were doing good work taking down big bad drug dealers and fighting the cartels. I was a stupid nave kid. I ended up falling two stories off a zip cord and breaking eight vertebrae in my spine. I was in a wheelchair for weeks and in immense pain. The doctors put me on a drug they told me was safe and not addictive. This drug was OxyContin&and it ruined my life.\n        I spent the next thirteen years becoming more and more addicted to the pain meds and the doctors tried me out on everything as my tolerance grew and would still not manage the pain. I began to lose jobs, act out, my family and friends were terrified and sent me to rehab. I spent many years in numerous rehabs, jails, and psych wards until I finally had enough. I tried to get clean with methadone. It didn't work. It was just another addiction. Then I was told about suboxone and my insurance covered it for three years. For those three years, I stayed out of trouble, held down a job, had my own place again and had a steady girlfriend. I ended up losing my insurance and subsequently, could no longer afford the suboxone. So I went back to pain management and was put on dilaudid. This started the worst years of my life. The dilaudid was only effective if injected I was told (BY THE DOCTOR!) so this quack who is now serving time and lost his practice actually encouraged me to start abusing my prescribed medicine intravenously. I began shooting up. This is when the overdoses started to occur. I overdosed over fourteen times in a six month period, had over a dozen friends die from overdoses, suicides or murders all related to opiates. I couldn't afford the dilaudid anymore and was introduced to heroin. I lost everything. I became homeless and even had my own brother who was married with two young kids die from an accidental overdose as he was a pharmacy tech going to school to be a pharmacologist but was introduced to the wonders of opiates by me, his own brother. And he died when I was serving a year in jail for selling fifteen of my prescribed Vicodin pills to an undercover MBI (DEA) agent and charged with first degree trafficking in heroin. After I was released on ten years probation I still abused drugs and got away with it because they were being prescribed to me. More overdoses followed and I eventually tried to commit suicide. Most of my overdoses were complete flat line ods, but this was intentional and my heart stopped, my breathing stopped and I was dead for minutes. They eventually brought me back with multiple shots of narcan and a defibrillator and put me in a medically induced coma for eight days. When I came to, I vowed never to used drugs again, and checked into another rehab after spending six months in a critical care unit of a psych ward. While in rehab, I discovered this herb, kratom which I did a ton of research and found out was about as addictive as coffee, but would help with not only the withdrawals from the opiates, but would also help the cravings subside and help with my pain. Three years later I have been completely drug free and I use kratom on a daily basis. It helped save my life. I am now married to the most wonderful woman ever (and she even uses kratom on occasion I'd her menstrual cramps are bad) and she is the most anti drug person I've ever known , my family is not only talking to me but enjoys having me around, and my Mom who abhors drugs because of what she's seen them do to her own family loves that I've found  kratom and that it not only helps my pain and cravings, but has also given me my life back. I'm writing you this letter letting you know that if you take kratom and ban it in December, many people, myself included will be in a horrible and terrifying position. I never want to be on opiates again. And kratom is NOT an opiate. It is a partial opiate agonist. I'm not going to go into the science for you, but I am pleading with you that you keep kratom legal. Regulate it if you have to. Make it 18 and up if you have to, but please don't take the plant away from me that helps me live a productive and full life. I don't want to be another statistic in the opiate epidemic that if you ban kratom will only get even worse. Thank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAaron Thomas Gombar","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8459","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Aaron Gombar","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,\n\nI think kratom has the potential to help a lot of people, please do not ban it prematurely without doing the necessary research.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11532","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Andrew Voelkl","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Have we learned nothing from the war on drugs?

I was diagnosed with moderate to severe TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) about 6 years ago. I've also suffered from chronic kidney stones for about 11 years. Non-medicinal treatments have been ineffective for me for both issues. I also have struggled with generalized anxiety most of my life.\n\nI am 31 years old, I was offered high amounts of prescription opiates by my doctors in my twenties for pain resulting from my ailments. I never became addicted to them, however as the laws have changed so have my options to receive adequate relief. This has impacted my family, my living status, my career, and my life. At times I'd found I was unable to even speak or move well, resulting in missed opportunities with work and ultimately losing my home at one point.\n\nWhen I discovered Kratom, I'd found such relief during days that otherwise would be completely impairing for me. My kidneys seem to be releasing fewer stones since I began taking Kratom (or I feel them less possibly), and I am able to speak and eat every day. I do not use Kratom daily; over the counter drugs are used in between to avoid abuse and building tolerances. Kratom also has given me strong relief in situations where anxiety would otherwise prohibit me from success, particularly with work. Ever since Kratom, I have been promoted to over double my salary, found the ability to confidently begin a family, and am very close to financially being able to live in my own home again. \n\nThank you very much for your time. I beg of you to please continue to allow use of Kratom in the US for those of us who have benefited so much from its availability.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7674","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stacy Brockway","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello,  I am a former addict.

My wife was diagnosed with fibromyalgia over 20 years ago. She has been in constant pain for years and has tried all kinds of pharmaceuticals, which never really did much for her. We have been together now for a little over three years and I have seen her in so much pain she couldnt function. \n\nMy wife discovered kratom through a social media chronic pain group and decided to give it a try. I am so glad she did because it has made such a difference in her quality of life. There were days before kratom when she could barely get out of bed, let alone go through the motions of her normal everyday activities. When we got together, I lived in Texas and she lived in Ohio. I moved her to Texas with me and we lived in a second story apartment. She only left the apartment twice a month to do her grocery shopping because, with her pain, she simply wasnt able to navigate the steps. \n\nIt has been a year and half since my wife discovered kratom and so much has changed in that time. We moved to Ohio a little over a year ago and rented a duplex with an upstairs bathroom, which requires her climb the stairs several times a day. Not only is she able to do this, but she took on a full time job, babysitting her great niece five days a week. She also gets out of the house a lot more often. She is able to attend social events again, such as birthday parties, family get-togethers and graduation parties.\n\nI have used kratom myself, on occasion, for hip pain and lower back pain and I am simply amazed by the quality of pain relief it provides, without any side effects.\n\nI have watched my wife go from barely functioning day to day to living a productive life. Kratom has given my wife her life back and I am so grateful that she has found this healing herb, which has no dangerous side effects, does not provide a high or alter her state of mind in any way. It simply provides pain relief and allows her to live her life again. Kratom is not a drug; it is a plant with healing properties and should be treated as such. My wifes is but one case study.  I have heard many similar stores through social media. I implore you to not ban this plant as it has helped so many. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSincerely,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRussell E.

Kratom is not addictive, and poses no threat to the public health.  Unlike heroine and other opioids available through prescription,  it does not suppress the respiratory system, thus does not have the danger of overdose death.  \nYour claims of the kratom's dangers to the public are not accurate, since in all cases there were other drugs involved with those deaths.  It seems obvious that your unnatural push to place kratom in the Schedule 1 category is driven by the special interests of the Pharmaceutical industry, which makes billions of dollars each year providing addictive opiods to the public.  \nThere are tens of thousands of Kratom users who, if you schedule kratom,  you will be turning into felons for no reason.  We are minding our own business, hurting no one and living our lives as best we can. We are not criminals, are not a safety hazard to society or ourselves,  we are merely asking that the government stay out of our homes.\nPlease explain how alcohol and cigarettes, both of which have been proven to be addictive and lethal, are legal, but kratom, an obscure plant that is neither addictive nor lethal is threatened with scheduling.\nThe War on drugs has been recognized nationally as an epic failure, why does the DEA continue to pursue it?  This is another example of government overreaching into the privacy of American lives.  \n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9457","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Kataura","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 100 percent disabled veteran that uses Kratom daily.I use this all natural substance responsible for my depression and anxiety.

I just went to the \"mmmspeciosa.com website to order my Kratom and saw that the DEA is trying to schedule Kratom as a schedule 1 drug! I can't believe this!!! Kratom is technically NOT an opiate! We have a REAL opiate problem in our country and Kratom is NOT it! Has Kratom ever caused any overdose deaths? No. How many Kratom addicts have you heard of? Any reports of people stealing to get their Kratom fix (other than some statistical outlier)? None. Kratom is an ALL-natural herb that has been used safely by hundreds of thousands of people. To schedule Kratom would be like scheduling Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Benedryl is sometimes taken to get some sort of a buzz buts it's not dangerous nor does it produce any effects that would cause it to be an addictive drug. Kratom is the same except it doesn't produce effects that would cause one to fall asleep while driving like say diphenhydramine might. Kratom is an answer to the issues so commonly faced by opiate addicts. In my experience, Kratom is probably the only thing that keeps me from going and using illicit opiates. I do not like the idea of being used by the pharmaceutical industry, i.e. being put on methadone or suboxone maintenance programs that end up being more addictive than the initial drug you were on! Kratom has an abuse potential less than that of codiene! Codiene is legal in most other countries! I don't understand why the DEA would even consider making this  beneficial herb a schedule I drug. It's shows the ignorance of the people who are in charge of this. In EVERY situation there are people who take advantage of substance and misuse it, but there are so many other actual DANGEROUS drugs that ARE still legal and there is NO backlash from the DEA on them; I'm talking about inhalants. Inhalants kill people, and I can go right now and buy them with no issue. \nKratom is an herb, it's antioxidant, it doesn't cause detriment to the body, it helps with depression, has never caused an overdose or death, its detoxifying and overall a great way to keep clean from illicit drugs. I implore you to see the flaw in your thinking that Kratom is a \"illicit drug\" that should be scheduled. Kratom is something that keeps me clean, please don't schedule it. Any misuse is clearly a statistical outlier and should be treated as so. Please do the research needed and collect FACTS. This is not a DANGEROUS drug. Believe and understand and don't take away our ability to buy our plant that is honestly from the coffee family... what's next? Will we be banning coffee because caffeine is dangerous? Because Kratom is about as dangerous as coffee. Thank you for taking the time to read my comments - I hope you can see the wisdom in my words. \n\nSincerely \n\nCheyenne Sabrina Warner","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3501","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-07T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Cheyenne Warner","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Clearly there are medicinal benefits for opiate addicts.

The psychoactive effect of Kratom is subtle and many people would not even consider it a \"high\". Its users report many benefits from using Kratom, such as:\n-Reduced anxiety\n-Increased energy\n-Pain management\n-Cough Suppression\n-Addiction recovery\n-Lower blood pressure\n-Insulin regulation.\n\nThe only real side effect of Kratom is withdrawal symptoms that can be very easily avoided by not taking very often. These side effects only occur if taken every or almost every day for a considerable amount of time. Other minor side effects are itchiness, nausea and slight constipation. These are minimal compared to the benefits it produces.\nIt is also very useful to significantly reduce the withdrawal symptoms from stopping opiates.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5165","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Chris Deril","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have a strong belief in herbal medicines and saving the body from foreign synthetics if one chooses to medicate themselves.

One thing may not be as beneficial as the other. Using Kratom for a headache or backache should be widely considered a great alternative to mild pain killers like Ibuprofen, Tylenol, or even Tramadol. Which all have very negative and dangerous short and long term side effects. As far as abuse, I assure you I was a teenager. Gobbling down handfuls of gel caps or drinking teas wasn't ever heard of or the popular thing to do. At doses at which any sort of recreational effects are felt , many would find themselves nauseous and would most likely never use or encourage others to. This plant isn't for abusing, or getting high with your friends. It's a natural long aged coffee derivative that's been used for millennia. The fact people can get off heroin and prescription medications safely should open an eye. It helps people who have fallen into a problem they are scared to face. A user isn't always a criminal. The criminal only comes out when the user goes too far. Leaving this option on the streets gives innocent people who's been gripped by addiction a way out. Before they loose everything including there lives.  So I as a concerned citizen, would like all who are involved to thoroughly be informed about this misinformation that has been spread about.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9138","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Perna","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Stop it!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20363","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, kratom help me quit a 10 decade opiate addiction. I now have money and friends in my life! I say this with utmost concern, If kratom becomes banned, there will be a skyrocket in opiate death, they think it's bad now it will only get worse.. instead of kratom( Doesn't cause respiratory depression so you can't die from stoppinh breathing) Kratom isn't a narcotic. for example, you take 2 percocets, you feel pretty good, you take 1 more and you feel greatttt. Well with kratom you can take 1 dose but if you try more with in a 12 hour period it will give you negative side effects (nothing too bad) making you not want to more of it, unlike other narcotics which get you more messed up the more you take. It really helps cure opiate addiction, I've personally help around 15 take the step from narcotics with nasty side effects and it's nasty liver killing tylenol.\n\nI think it should be a supplement, it helps with lots of things, i started kratom 3 yeas ago, i haven't had a cold since. Kratom is full of antioxidants. It helps great with restless leg syndrome and helps all sorts of conditions that cause pain(by easing the pain).

After years of one on one therapy, 7 months of intensive outpatient therapy, and over 17 different medications, my doctor finally told me about kratom. With the prescription meds I would sleep walk, became pre-diabetic, would have worse mood swings, was unable to be a functional member of my family and society, was still unable to be in public, and I was always getting sick. My doctor, who lived in Asia for years, told me about kratom. I tried it, and i have never looked back. I now am 100% pharmaceutical free. I was even able to hold a job as a veterinarian technician where stress was a normal part of the day. I have even competed in a Jiu-jitsu tournament in front of hundreds of people and won. I can go to my daughter's school functions, be there for my wife, and my wife is able to work now and not have to stay at home to take care of me. To me, kratom is the same as using st. Johns wart or other supplements. I have taken kratom for 3 yrs now, and not once have i had any side effects. Medications on the market have a long list of side effects that include death, and 10 yrs later there are law suits against them. The worst side effect, if you call it that, kratom has is needing to drink more water. I drink 92oz of water a day, and I dont have bowel movement issues, groggy feelings, or headaches. To make a plant illegal is beyond comprehensible. I fought for the right for our government to operate in the interest of the people. Not the interests of those with money and lobbyists who bribe officials to take away my god given right to treat myself with nature. In all states where kratom has been banned, the overdose rates of opiates have increased. If public safety were really the concern, kratom would be left alone. That fact there is a medication made based off kratom shows there is medicinal use for it, and that placing it as schedule 1 is only for the benefit of big pharma.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1765","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brandon McIntyre","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Banning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\nIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\nKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain reliever and opioid replacement.\nMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\nSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\nProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-18186","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"It's simple.

This plant has been around for many centuries and there is no evidence to suggest that it is harmful for human consumption. Some users may report negative side effects as with any other herbal supplement or medications. I feel that more clinical research needs to be done before Kratom becomes a scheduled substance. Users of this supplement should educate themselves of its affects to determine if it is right for them. I feel There is no need for the FDA to ban this substance as there has not been enough reported negative cases of its use. The Vast Majority of Kratom users are functional members of society, I believe the high retail cost of Kratom prevents young people from Misusing this supplement. I strongly feel that Kratom should not be sold at gas stations and corner stores where people go to look for a cheap buzz....If used correctly this supplement is very beneficial! I hope that the FDA can come to a reasonable conclusion about Kratom without banning its use. Please support Kratom Research and discover the truths of this natural herb!

According to the information I have been exposed to it appears that kratom helps people who have previously been unable to succeed with more traditional methods of therapy. The only reason that kratom might be banned here in the future would be directly attributed to the overwhelming greed, power and persuasion of the big pharmaceutical corporations who routinely use bribery (better known as lobbying) to suppress or ban anything which they cannot exploit directly for their own monetary gains. Kratom causes no harm to people, but rather helps many through one of the hardest struggles of their life and the fact that it is an organic remedy, much like marijuana, it represents a much healthier step in the right direction for anyone looking to reverse the pharmaceutical death grip that is opiate addiction. We should be using logic and reason as a compass whenever formulating any serious idea pertaining to legislation and if the DEA  really wants to save American lives or improve the standard of living for hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of Americans, then they should be trying to hold the pharmaceutical corporations accountable for all the horrific policies they routinely practice, which are all driven by the idea that profits are more important then people, much like the drug dealers and nacro cartels that the DEA pursues everyday. Kratom however is a supplement that helps more & more people restore their lives everyday with no serious side effects and whether or not an adult want to ingest it, should not be up for debate or for that matter, in any danger of being prohibited. There are plenty other real threats to be dealt with here in America, alcohol, cigarettes and plenty of pharmaceuticals which we can directly correlate to the death of millions of Americans, but kratom alone has none, so tell me how or why this even became an issue unless it directly revolves around the pharmaceutical industry potentially losing out on a percentage of their profits.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10664","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kenneth Benton","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to urge your agency not to schedule Kratom.

Also, I have been able to reduce use of my anti-anxiety and anti-depression meds because the kratom helps so well with my symptoms.

These sellers are so careful at making sure the buyers get quality kratom product and nothing else. As you may hear from people in these comments, kratom is also a useful tool to help those with addiction to dangerous drugs.  Making kratom a schedule 1 drug would cut off access to those people who want and need a more holisitc and natural approach to pain killers and other scheduled medication....medications that they themselves are addicting.

He also sent me to physical therapy, of which I have derived some benefit.The Ibuprofen caused stomach ulcers, so my doctor switched me to Tylenol. I took the Tylenol daily as directed. My doctor did not want to prescribe addictive painkillers, as I agreed. My blood tests indicated high liver enzymes, most likely caused from the Tylenol, as indicated by my doctor. I  found Kratom on the internet. I researched as much as possible, as well as presented the anecdotal evidence of efficacy to my Doctor. I made a reluctant decision to order some. I was pleasantly suprised with the benefits I had obtained from the Kratom. My doctor recently ran blood tests and was pleased to see that my liver enzymes have returned to normal.

I am strongly opposed to the proposed scheduling of Kratom.\n \nI spend my days seeing patients that are suffering from substance related illness. The most common being tobacco, alcohol and opiate related illness.\n \nTwo of the aforementioned substances are completely legal for consumption by adults, however, they pose a serious health threat to our community. The CDC says over 480,000 Americans die each year from tobacco-induced illness (1 in every 5 US deaths). Another 41,000 non-smokers die from diseases caused by secondhand smoke. Upwards of 14,000 people in 2014 died from prescription narcotics. The statistics for alcohol are equally alarming.\n \nResearch has overwhelmingly shown that alcohol and tobacco have zero health benefit. Consumption of either of these two substances is nothing but detrimental to health.\n \nAdditionally, alcohol, tobacco and narcotics are extremely addictive. So addictive, in fact, that I see patients continue to use these substances even when they are suffering from severe substance-related illness.\n \nWhat I dont see during my shifts in the Emergency Department are patients with Kratom-related illness. There is not a single instance in which I have seen a patient present to the Emergency department due to Kratom-related illness. Upon reviewing the most commonly cited instances of Kratom-related death, I have found that the overwhelming majority of them clearly involved multi drug abuse.\n \nMy personal experience with Kratom has been that the only adverse event that results from taking too much is vomiting.  While I dont take Kratom on a daily basis, I have taken it occasionally (maybe two to three times per month) for increased energy. On the other hand, I know plenty of people who suffer from serious illness and use the herbal supplement on a daily basis to successfully manage their illness.  I have also read many hundreds of testimonials of people who have benefited from this herbal supplement.\n \nI would never prescribe Kratom to a patient.  Similarly, I would never prescribe other herbal supplements such as turmeric, black cohosh or Echinacea, all of which have health benefits.  My practice is limited to that which I have studied and that which has been accepted by the medical community. It is up to my patients whether or not they want to take advantage of herbal remedies that have been used for thousands of year prior to the advent of the pharmaceutical industry. I use many herbal supplements myself.\n \nAs an Emergency Physician, I am acutely aware that Kratom does not pose a serious health threat to our community. If it did, it would be my job to be aware of it and know how to treat it. \n \nI am shocked that there is a push to criminalize a benign herbal supplement that has been shown to benefit so many.  The only regulation that may be beneficial is to require vendors to document purity of product in order to avoid the sale of adulterated product.\n \nIf the goal of the DEA is to ban substances that pose significant health threats to our community, tobacco, alcohol and prescription narcotics should be first on the list.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAddie J Davis, MD","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1892","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Addie Davis","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not personally use kratom but I know a few people who currently do.

At one point my daughter said she had had enough and in spite of her Drs advice she decided to quite the last of her opioid pain medications. Because of the addiction that happened with these medications, she did her research and saw where a local store was promoting Kratom for opioid addiction.  She chose to do a fast step down off the medications  and took Kratom through the initial withdrawal stage and for a few weeks after.  She said she felt like Kratom was a 'miracle'. She has now been off all medications for over 6 months.  I believe on rare occasions still uses Kratom for the continued pain from her injuries.

A large majority of my customers use it to get off of prescrption pain killers that make them feel bad and hinder their ability to live a norman life. Based on my analysis of how government works, it is my belief that the federal government originally wanted to schedule kratom because it competes directly with the pharmaceutical industry. We all know of how the revolving door and campaign contributions effect public policy so I wad excited to see the DEA reverse their decision to emergency schedule kratom. I hope you guys continue to do the right thing in leaving it completely legal. Another thing, i do not belive it should be regulated. This will only serve to drive up prices, make it harder to obtain, and add unnecesary bureacratic intervention to the mix. Leave it be. I hope that even though big pharma and the FDA are so so cozy that they give u an honest and objective examination of this amazing plant. Do the right thing DEA. Please.

I'm 32 and a database manager by profession.  I wanted to write to voice my opposition to the DEA's proposed ban on the herbal supplement Kratom.  When I was 21, my wife and I were in a bad car accident that left me with chronic back pain.  When my back would flare up, I would take prescribed medications that made my life difficult.  I was given opiates and muscle relaxers that left me unable to function at my job because of the side-effects of these medications.  I discovered Kratom by chance when reading news stories on the internet and decided to do as much research as I could.  I tried Kratom and quickly discovered that it helped me function much better than the medications.  It improved my quality of life without sedating and depressing me like the medications.  Shortly thereafter I stopped taking all medications for back pain and spasms and felt the best I had ever felt since the accident.  If the ban goes through, I'll be left to make the agonizing decision of either coping with debilitating pain or going back to taking medications that I don't want to take.  In my life, the only drugs that I've seen destroy lives are alcohol and pills.  The people's whose lives were destroyed by pills always started with a prescription from a doctor.  I don't want to and refuse to end up like those people.  I have always had faith in my country and government to do the moral and just thing, but unfortunately this proposed ban has shaken the very foundation of my concept of being an American.  I am not a criminal or a bad person.  I only seek the liberty to live my life freely and to make my own decisions.  Please stop this absurd ban and focus your resources on the things statistically killing the most Americans.  More importantly, please stop this proposed ban to restore the people's faith in the institutions of this country.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16669","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Braden Schroeder","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a thirty year old who has struggled with fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety. I've tried a very log list of prescription treatments for these conditions. Kratom is the only thing that has helped all three of my conditions without having extremely negative affects on my life. \n\nI found kratom when my sister told me she tried it for her chronic pain. She shared some with me, and the relief was immeasurable. I was able to drop my current prescription anxiety and pain meds (klonopin and tramadol). The side effects from those medications were nearly as bad as the conditions they were treating. I struggled with physical dependence on tramadol, which my doctors never warned me about. For me, tramadol dependence and side effects were severe. I became far more anxious, and stopped feeling strong emotions. I was sleep-walking through my life. Tramadol is also known to cause seizures even in those with tolerance, which was a terrifying possibility on my worst pain days. \n\nThe first day I tried kratom, I broke down and sobbed at the overwhelming rush of emotion that I felt. I knew my emotions had been severely capped, but in the years on the drug, I had forgotten just how bad it felt. Suddenly, off the tramadol with no withdrawal and my pain well-managed from kratom, I realized just how apathetic I had been feeling. \n\nI strongly oppose this herbal supplement being banned. It would be extremely detrimental to those who have never found relief outside of opiate prescriptions. I have family and friends whose lives have been ruined by prescription drugs. Please do not remove a safe alternative for myself and my loved ones. \n\nI support FDA regulation of kratom, to further keep people safe and know that what they are taking is authentic and unadulterated. Just as if I were to purchase a bottle of standardized St, John's Wort at the store.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9521","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Kristi Murphy","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Several years ago I was severely addicted to prescription pain medicine.

I bought an ounce and tried it a couple of times. Initially, I was unimpressed and went back to pills. As you are well aware, we have possibly the biggest opiod epidemic here in America and I would be another statistic if it weren't for kratom. I never paid kratom mind while I wasted away in my addiction until I heard the DEA was going to ban it on October 1. After researching some more, I decided to give this plant another shot and I am glad I did. I have not touched a pill in 3 months and counting! To you, it may seem odd that a plant can restore such quality of life, but I am not alone. Since the announcement of the initial ban, I would like to note, my interest in kratom was restored. Prohibiting a product does not mean the use will drop, actually quite the contrary. I know many have expressed interest in this new 'drug' since the announcement and if that isn't proof that prohibition does not work, I don't know what to tell you. \n\nI sincerely hope you reconsider scheduling this plant. I believe it has many benefits that should be studied and it could possibly help in curbing this opiod epidemic. I do not think it is fair to disregard so many of your fellow Americans because of your ignorance and I would like to thank you for stopping the initial ban to listen to our perspective. Let it be known, if kratom is made illegal I have no doubt in my mind millions will go back to using heroin or other deadly painkillers. I believe kratom should be regulated and treated as an herbal supplement. I think we need to educate ourselves on this plant instead of outright banning it and in the long run, our kids will thank us. Prescription pain pills are not the answer, so what do you have to lose from studying a natural pain-reliever?","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-8027","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nMy name is Kevin D.

After researching this leaf of a tree related to the coffee plant, members of my family, some friends, and I have ingested kratom for a variety of reasons - knee pain incurred as a Marine in Afghanistan, Iraq; injuries suffered by a rancher caused by unruly cows; and individuals who use it to control asthma, allergies, IBS, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, migraines, as well as chronic pain. In light of the DEA's threat of equating kratom with opioids, hallucinogenic or psychedelic substances, depressants, etc., we have discussed our experiences using kratom. Using it regularly or occasionally, none of us have had any adverse side-effects, have not experienced a \"high\", and have not felt we were addicted, but rather could count on it to make a difference in our daily lives when needed. (I know individuals who can't get through their day without coffee or sugar!) All are dismayed that we may have to go back to pharmaceuticals that have ingredients that have been proven to have negative and even dangerous side-effects. We aren't too happy about being considered felons, either. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that supports the benefits of kratom for thousands of people. Every article on this subject is followed by their testimonials. This is about my and others' quality of life without the typically over-priced pharmaceuticals that aren't necessarily safe.  One more thing, from a personal experience, I know I cannot accidentally or intentionally \"overdose\" as in \"if one or two works maybe 3 or 4 or more will work better\"; my system will reject it by causing me to immediately vomit. Simple.  I've read this has happened to others, also.  Thank you for providing this opportunity to express my feelings and hope that you understand this is not a dangerous drug.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5058","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Deborah Lawrence","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Im a 35-year-old husband and father of four who found kratom two years ago as I was exploring natural ways to help reduce my consumption of alcohol. I came across kava and kratom and both plants have done wonders for my life and consequently for my familys.\nBack then, I was a relatively heavy drinker and it had begun to affect my relationships and professional life. Kratom (and kava) were instrumental in getting my life back on track. Today, I rarely drink alcohol, and when I do, I have complete control over how much I consume  that was not the case before kratom.\nSeveral months later, I discovered kratom allowed me to discontinue use of antidepressants (Prozac), which I had used on and off for 15 years to treat mild depression. These pharmaceutical drugs gave me horrible side effects, including lack of libido and putting me into a zombie-like state where I had no cares or expression  I was coasting through life as a bystander rather than living a happy, productive life.\nI havent taken a pharmaceutical drug in two years, and Im so grateful for that. The fact that I can supplement a leaf (kratom) into my daily regimen and experience so many great benefits still blows me away. I cant believe how much it has directly and indirectly improved my life in terms of my family life/marriage, professionally in my career, as well as health wise.\nIm in the best shape Ive been since I was 19, and the motivation and uplifting effects of kratom are a big part of that. Much like coffee, kratom tea helps me get up and get going with the day, but without the caffeine. Its effects are very mild, yet powerful. Ive only experienced side effects one time early on when I took too much and became nauseous for about an hour. Compared to the pharmaceutical drugs Ive taken in the past, the side effects of kratom can be considered extremely mild  almost non-existent  when taken in moderation.\nScheduling kratom alongside heroin, LSD and other street drugs would be a shame, to say the least. Kratom is very misunderstood, and understandably so. It has not been in the spotlight in this country up until a few months ago as the DEA announced the intent to schedule it. Since that point, the public outcry has been immense and steady. Support for this wonderful plant has been nothing short of miraculous.\nI urge the DEA to reconsider categorizing kratom as a schedule 1 drug. We need more research on kratom, and banning it would considerably hinder this initiative. Alternative solutions could be some sort of regulation (e.g., age restrictions similar to alcohol) and/or quality regulations for the vendors that sell the plant. I am in full support of further research on the plant, quality guidelines for sellers of the plant and age restrictions on its consumption. Thank you for your time and concern on this matter.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3037","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joe Eitel","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hello, I am a 6 foot 7 inch tall software developer for a government contractor that develops software solutions for healthcare.

Several years ago I broke my back when a drunk driver, an executive CEO of Met Life Insurance hit me in an automobile accident. I was misdiagnosed for months leading to tremendous pain and my spine healing in the wrong way. Once the doctors looked at my original x-rays and figured out that my spine was broken I was prescribed very strong opiates and spent two years in physical therapy, chiropractic therapy, injection therapy, massage therapy, and acupuncture therapy. The pain was so severe that I had to quit school and my job that I had been at for six years. I took the pills I was told to take by different doctors and it led to  crippling anxiety, depression, severe addiction, chronic pain,  and suicidal thoughts. It got to a point where I could not function on a daily basis and hold down a job or go to school. I suffered through this for years and lost all hope until I found Kratom. This plant gave me back my joy, my happiness, my hope for my future, helped reduce my chronic pain so I could go back to school and work two jobs. I got off of all prescribed pain meds and off of all opiates pain relievers. This plant truly helps thousands of tax paying individuals function better in day to day life. It helps with mental health, physical health, chronic pain, PTSD, depression, anxiety and so many other diseases.

I started to take Kratom in February of this year. I became very sick and in a lot of pain. While my doctors we sending me in for test after test trying to figure out what was happening in my body. I was throwing up everyday with extreme fatigue and pain in my feet legs and abdomen. At first I started taking Kratom after work to get some relief and so I could eat. I did this until July 21st when I was admitted to the ICU for dehydration and malnourishment weighing 133LBs.  Since I was released from the hospital I have been taking kratom at least two times a day to alleviate pain and provide energy. Before I was in the hospital in July I was struggling at work and I found out later that I was almost relieved of my duties. Since July I have become the employee that I know I can be. Kratom is giving me my life back and without it I do not know what I will do. the doctors will not prescribe pain medications because they can make my Gastroparesis worse. I have gained back 20LBs since July and I am learning how to live with my condition. Kratom has truly been a life saver to me and as I read testimonials I am not the only one. To close out I personally do not believe that kratom is dangerous and that is a safer alternative than what the doctors prescribe. I also think that banning kratom is a disservice to the American people who want to try natural remedies after they have exhausted all other options.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10620","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anthony DiGregorio","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I feel strongly that Kratom should be legalized.

Kratom has been a godsend in my life.\n\nI suffer from social anxiety which has led to anxiety attacks and depression that has become worse with age.  I was turning into a hermit that did not want to leave the house and it was  becoming harder to interact with people and to be in social situations. My job would stress me out so much I could not sleep, nor wanted to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nI have tried everything (medications, herbs, amino acids, meditation, avoidance, and exercise) to help with my condition.  I learned of Kratom on-line and decided to give it a try. It is now the single best supplement to help me with my condition - with the least side effects. Kratom, paired with exercise, has completely turned my condition around and I feel like a \"normal\" person and look forward to work each day as well as social interactions. \n\nI cannot begin to understand why this plant would become a controlled substance because it is mild, has limited side effects, and the body will reject it before it can cause serious harm (by throwing it up).  \n\nI think of it as \"coffee for my spirit\", and as such, I take a small amount each morning with my coffee.  It gives me a slight mood boost and allows me to get out of the house comfortably and allows me to interact with the world around me in a positive way.  It has been nothing but a positive force in my life.  I hope the DEA reconsiders their decision to control this mild substance.  To me, it is like them trying to control the coffee bean.  It just doesn't make sense.  I hope the DEA reconsiders. \n\nThanks,\n\nMatt","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22395","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Kisser","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Scheduling Kratom would be a huge mistake.

I am a chef, and farmer who has found the issue of Kratom legislation important enough to submit a comment.  I am fairly new to this plant, and only learned of it after the proposed emergency scheduling, a couple months ago. I am somewhat knowledgeable about botanical medicines, and plants in general.  When Kratom is fresh and pure, it produces mild analgesia and calmness.  A lucid energetic boost is also common of some strains.  Sleep is somewhat deeper after a Kratom dose, and the following morning it is common to feel more refreshed than usual.  The side effects of Kratom may involve stomach upset,  and some mild anxiety and soreness the following day.  Although all of these negative effects combined are still quite negligible, especially in comparison to any pharmaceutical drug that treats pain or anxiety, but still deserve to be noted.  I was in a car accident several years ago, and deal on a regular basis with a fair amount of pain. Over the counter, NSAID medication like Advil provides minor relief.  I have never, and will never use illegal opioids, because I care about my health, and have no desire to break the law.      I don't drink or smoke.  I was prescribed oxycodone after being released from the hospital from orthopedic surgery following my accident.  Although I was in a great deal of pain, the side effects of this drug were too great, and I refrained from using it all but about 3 times during the hardest part of my recovery period.  Depression, intense headaches, mood swings, muscle spasms, and a long grueling recovery are just a few of the side effects related to the use of oxycodone.  Although much time has passed, my work is full of physical labor and long hours on my feet which can often exacerbate my condition, resulting in pain and reduced mobility.  I believe discovering Kratom was a gift in the treatment of pain.  I do not take Kratom very often, a couple of times a month when my pain is at its worst, never more frequently than once a week.  I haven't found it to be addictive or physically/mentally damaging, when taken this way and in low doses.  It is empowering to know I have an herbal tool for the treatment of moderate to severe pain and anxiety.  Keeping such a plant legal could empower others to make healthier choices, and help deal with the epidemic of prescription and illegal drug use.  It is also clear that this plant isn't entirely harmless, few medicines are.  More scientific studies should be done to create a clear and unbiased picture.  Safeguards should be set in place to ensure purity of therapeutic Kratom from legitimate authorized retailers.  Scheduling Kratom could have the negative effect of turning some users to harder drugs.  Organized crime could take control of the supplies of this plant, fueling the illicit cartels that your organization opposes.  All for a plant that shares more in common with coffee than with opium.  In my unprofessional opinion, it is clear that Kratom has many therapeutic uses, and that the threat posed by Kratom to the public's health is considerably less than tobacco, alcohol, and prescription opioids and anxiolytics.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15192","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"anonymous anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Considering our ongoing issues with government spending, it does not seem prudent to dedicate the large amount of tax dollars that will be required to implement and enforce banning this substance. \n\nCiting 660 calls to poison control centers over a period of five years does nothing to bolster the argument for the ban.

And she has days where using Kratom is the only way she can function because the pain she experiences is so intense. I believe that, out of all the substances out there, Kratom is not one that should be scheduled. It is not an opioid. It is not a chemical. It is a plant. Just as marijuana is a plant. I have done my research on this and there have not been any deaths that were caused by using Kratom alone. In the few deaths that had occured, there was always another, much more dangerous, drug or substance present. Do not schedule Kratom when it has not caused any deaths on its own. Do not schedule Kratom when there are so many people that rely on it to deal with issues such as chronic pain or help to help themselves break an opioid addiction, instead of turning to drugs that are being sold by Big Pharma, like Oxycodone, that are much more addictive and harmful. Kratom is, in all essences, a plant that is related to the coffee plant. If Kratom is really that harmful, then why hasn't coffee been banned for its addictive nature? Why haven't prescription narcotics been banned for their addictiveness, especially when they cause more deaths per year than Kratom and marijuana combined?

I am writing for my son to strongly urge you not to ban this naturally growing substance named Kratom.  In his younger years, almost all of my son's friends were recreationally taking some drug or another  He resisted. He liked his profession, was extremely good at it and was happily supporting his wife and family.  When their children were almost grown his wife contracted Lymes Disease (but it went undiagnosed for 6 years).  She was terribly sick.  My son had been hurt on his job, but he needed to keep working in order to keep health care for his wife, and to support the family.  His foreman offered him an opiate painkiller to help with his pain and keep him working.  Over time he became addicted.  He sought out a doctor to help him stop taking the pills.  The doctor gave him Suboxone to help him withdraw.  Then the doctor was supposed to withdraw him from Suboxone also -- Instead, the doctor kept him taking Suboxone for over two years.  When we finally got him to a withdrawal and rehab facility, they told us that Suboxone is the most difficult prescription drug to withdraw from.  When my son returned from rehab he fell into a depression that has lasted until this day, 4 1/2 years later.  While seeing a primary care physician, a psychologist and a psychiatrist he has tried many remedies with no effect.  His wife continually researches on the internet to try to find something that will help him.  She has read there that Suboxone could have irreversably damaged his brain.  SO MUCH FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS!  Finally, they found Kratom.  Just a small amount helps him to get out of bed and take part in his family's life, shopping, playing with his grandchildren, just keeping his head above the darkness that can claim him.

I had tried several times to get clean but kept failing. Kratom was the only thing that helped me get through my withdrawals in retrospect. Since then, I have used Kratom on an off for about three years in it's pure plant form, mixed with some cold water. I can only describe the effects mildly, similar to coffee in intensity, but relaxing and uplifting. Certainly not \"high\", by any stretch. I have also done extensive research on its active compounds, particularly 7-hydroxy mitragynine. I'd like to address some of the concerns that the DEA might have. Where are the bodies? No one has ever overdosed on Kratom and died, it has only ever been a part of poly-drug overdoses. I have taken an ounce of it at one time to test it and I did not have any symptoms other that mild nausea, and this is much higher than the doses that most people take. I did not have any respiratory depression (the big killer in opiates) whatsoever, no changes in Blood Pressure, no hallucinations, no disinhibition, nothing. I just felt very calm and relaxed. Is Kratom habit forming? In all honesty, probably. But no more so than something like coffee. On several occasions I have taken two weeks to a month without taking any Kratom and have had absolutely zero signs of withdrawals. The point is, studies have found no LD50, no hepatotoxicity and a very low potential for abuse. It is not dangerous at all and states have found a positive correlation between the ban of Kratom and increased hospitalizations from opiate overdoses. To say that it has no medicinal value and a high potential for abuse, insinuated by the DEA's intentions of making it a schedule 1 drug, is based completely on the ignorance of this harmless plant. More studies need to be done on its effects and it's potential for treating pain, anxiety and withdrawal symptoms and in the mean time, it should be grandfathered in as a supplement since it has been sold since before the 1990's and should not be regulated any more than coffee.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21601","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Brendan Lampman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"In regards to Docket No. DEA-442W - as an aging ARMY veteran, I implore you to keep Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine off of the Schedule 1 Controlled Substance list. I have just recently been introduced to 'Kratom' by a friend after he had learned that I had age related and service related pain - namely in my left wrist, knees, elbows, and back. Much to my surprise, I found that these chronic pains had very much subsided after taking Kratom and I am now able to lay off the 'prescribed' 600mg Ibuprophen and the 625mg. Acetaminophen which has been slowly becoming ineffective. To add to the benefits of using Kratom, I have grown up all my life with (un-diagnosed in 1960s) ADD which my Physician had treated with tranquilizers. i.e. Tranxene, Valium and Librium. To be frank, in my youth, I also tried various drugs such as Heroin, Quaaludes, and even Methamphetamine - anything to help me focus. In my adult years, after recovering from those addictions, I find that Kratom allows me to focus on my tasks at hand without feeling 'high', and subsequently I am able to think clearly and go about my business as a Journeyman Refrigeration Mechanic without 'stressing' about where I laid my tools or doing something dangerous and hurting myself. Since I am a law abiding citizen and choose not to use illegal substances anymore, I hope you will allow folks like myself to be able to legally buy Kratom as needed and keep it off the black market where it would surely be exploited and make an awful lot of 'criminals'  out of very normal people that use Kratom for all of the reasons I've read in the comments.

But many plants, supplements, beverages, and foods available to the public have psychoactive properties. Many of these things, such as caffeine and tobacco, are highly addictive.\n\nScheduling a substance like Kratom in the top tier of the controlled substance list will automatically make any current user a criminal. Further, it will make any future user a criminal. This is huge overreach for a drug that is not particularly abused, does not have a high likelihood of abuse, and when it is abused, it's abuse is comparable to other slightly psychoactive substances, and abuse of those substances are completely legal and often socially acceptable.\n\nA top tier scheduling of Kratom will also create huge barriers to research on the substance. The substance is currently considered not to have any medicinal qualities by the DEA, but it also has not been researched much in the United States. Schedule 1 substances are so heavily controlled, domestic research is all but entirely stalled. A good example is with marijuana research, in which most research into the medicinal benefits of marijuana are done outside the United States (http://www.newsweek.com/2015/12/25/outsourcing-american-marijuana-research-406184.html)\n\nTop tier scheduling also makes a substance almost impossible to reschedule. Again, using marijuana as an example, countries around the world, and many states within the US, have decided that marijuana does have medicinal properties. Yet the DEA refuses to reschedule the drug. If Marijuana was a schedule 2 or schedule 3 drug today, ask yourself, would the DEA be trying to make it a schedule 1?\n\n\nI do not believe that the DEA's scheduling system of drugs accurately reflects a substance's amount of harm in society, but I do understand that it is Congress that wrote the CSA and the DEA's job to enforce that law. I do not think Kratom should be scheduled, and should remain unregulated just as caffeine and other minor psychoactive are unregulated. For use in food products, regulation of Kratom should follow under the powers of the FDA, not the DEA.\n\nIf the DEA decides it should be regulating minor psychoactive substances such as caffeine and Kratom, I believe it should do so without criminalizing the thousands of people that currently use the substance. I also believe that it should not put limits on research and medicinal possibilities by prematurely scheduling it as a schedule 1 substance.\n\nInstead, the DEA should make all attempts to understand its medicinal possibilities, determine the safety of its use, and determine its actual likelihood of abuse/dependency as compared to other substances that are considered highly dependent-forming or abused.\n\nI also believe that Donald Trump should not be president, but this has nothing to do with Kratom.

What I am trying to say is that people suffering with similar conditions see Kratom as a blessing.

I've been married for 5 and half years to my wife, Chelsi, and we have been blessed with 5 beautiful children.\nI completely oppose the DEA's plan to place Kratom on the Schedule 1 Controlled Substance list and here is why. I feel everything natural was made by God for a purpose; from humans to dirt. Kratom is no exception. People from around the world have used plants, flowers, trees, herbs, etc for medicinal use before the creation of prescription drugs. Also it is estimated by the World Health Organization that 80% of people worldwide rely on herbal medicines for some part of their primary healthcare ( umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/treatment/herbal-medicine ). Some of these herbs include: Ginkgo Biloba which is used to treat circulatory disorders and enhance memory, Saw Palmetto which is used to treat BPH (a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate), and St. John's Wart which may be an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate depression. \nI have suffered from depression and anxiety for years. I self medicated with alcohol for most of those years until I realized I was the living definition of an alcoholic. I went to an in-patient rehabilitation center on April 7, 2013 and have been sober ever since. I was placed on Celexa 40mg and Buspirone 10mg July 2013 to treat depression and anxiety. They have helped somewhat but I have not been completely satisfied with them. I tried different medications but the side effects were too harsh. I started researching herbs and plants to treat depression and anxiety back in August of 2016. I came across this article, ensobotanicals.com/using-kratom-for-depression-a-complete-guide/, and was very intrigued. I began taking Kratom in August and it has literally changed my life!! I feel alive again! I have not had a single panic attack since August compared to having around 3 a month before supplementing Kratom. I dont' take my anxiety medicine anymore but I do still take Celexa. I've found that the combination is perfect for me. I wish I had found it years ago. I have since found MANY other people taking it for depression and anxiety also, but have talked with many more that take it for pain relief. The best part of Kratom is the only side effect I have found is that it takes me longer to ejaculate while being intimate with my wife. I can't say that's a negative thing either. HaHa I truly hope the DEA reconsiders the ban on Kratom as I feel it has safe, effective medicinal value.

She could shower by herself. She could go out to lunch if she wanted to. These were things that she wasn't able to do before because her pain medication left her so intoxicated that she couldn't function. She passed away in 2006 and the last few years of her life were quality instead of depression and bed, all thanks to kratom tea.

I have slipped discs in my neck that make just about any task extremely painful. I have been on numerous medications, including opioids, and the NSAIDS in particular have destroyed my stomach (I am now constantly on omeprazole from all the damage large amounts of ibuprofen have caused.) Kratom helps my condition more than anything else. It eases my pain and inflammation, it is gentle on my stomach, and it gives me the energy I need to work my 12-14 hour days running my own business. It is NOT addictive. I have never once had \"withdrawal\" symptoms from my Kratom tea (I made a tea from the crushed leaves,) and I have never once had a craving for it (which I experienced from my opioid medications that I am no longer taking.) I no longer need to constantly contact my doctor for re-fills on my medications, I no longer need to pay out hundreds, if not thousands of dollars every month just to see a doctor and have prescriptions filled. Kratom has given me my life back, and all I do is drink one cup of it a day in the morning. \nPlease do not schedule kratom. It is safe, it is gentle, it is saving lives. Help us help ourselves. \n\nSincerely,\nJillian M.

I'm 59 years old.  I'm a professional transcriptionist and I'm married with four beautiful grandchildren.  Kratom saved my life!! Please consider not classifying it as a scheduled 1 drug. I suffer from severe fibromyalgia with osteoarthritis, not to mention Chronic fatigue.  I'm a daily chronic pain sufferer.  Approximately one year ago I read about Kratom through Face Book and decided to try it.  THIS HERB HAS SAVED MY LIFE.  I was on sooo many medications for this disorder Gabapentin, Savella, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, and Lyrica was too expensive.  I had literally reached the end of my rope with this pain/fatigue.  I had no life! Even the air from the ceiling fan hurt my skin.   The sad part nothing was helping very well.  Would wake up at night in such pain I would cry and walk the floor.  I would even have to take a nap after taking a shower I was sooo tired daily.  I slept off and on spending nearly all my time in bed due to pain/fatigue.  I was so depressed I literally was contemplating taking my own life (if you can call what I just described as a life).  I tried Kratom and ohhhh my God what a difference it has made in my life.  It takes my pain level down more than any Rx and I now have energy to face the day...and SPEND time with my grandchildren.  I have thrown all my Rxs away (this was one year ago this December).  I'm sure I would most likely be dead right now if I had not discovered Kratom.  This plant has helped thousands and thousands of people with little side effects for myself.  It is a remarkable herb and should not be taken off the market or Scheduled.  I might agree if there was an age restriction like on alcohol (which kills people every single day and cigarettes).  Please thank you for this consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5761","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Tanya Yearout","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please stop this war on drugs!!!","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-10400","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Peter DeGregory","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"}],"totalNumRecords":23226}
