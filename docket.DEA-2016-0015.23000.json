It  saved my best friends life. Roughly my other seven best friends died of overdoses in the last 15 years. I'm really tired of seeing this happen. Suboxone hasn't saved any of them, kratom has.  I've never tried it. I hope I never in my life and up in a place where I need to get off of drugs. But what I've seen this plant to was absolutely miraculous and you will be killing people if you take it off of the market. I am not aware of anyone being hurt by it so I think we should slow down a little bit.  Make sure you're not killing more people then you're saving \n\n Thanks","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-17796","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Josh Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern, please don't schedule kratom.

My Sister-in-Law suffers from Fibromyalgiaa very painful nerve condition. Her Doctor prescribed opioids to deal with the pain. She found herself having to continually increase the dose and started suffering side effects from the medication.\n\nOn the recommendation of a fellow Fibromyalgia patient she tried the herb Kratom. She found that, not only did it help with the\npain better than the prescription opioids, but she did not suffer any of the debilitating side effects. In her words: \"this herb is amazing, it works better, has no side effects, and I don't have to keep increasing the dose\".\n\nOn behalf of my Sister-in-Law and several other patients I have spoken to who are dealing with severe pain, I urge the DEA not to ban Kratom, a herb that is a very safe alternative to prescription opioids. This is especially important when we are facing an  epidemic of addiction to pharmaceutical opiates. People dealing with pain need safe access to Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-22457","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Mackenzie-Smith","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern in the DEA,\n                   I would like to say that I do not take kratom but I have watched one of my best friends that had seizures and was VERY addicted to opiates take Kratom.

I was introduced to Kratom  1 yr ago by my brother who discovered it in online blogs while searching for a way to end his\naddiction of 12 years to oxycodone.   He came off of his prescription drugs within two weeks.  For me Kratom did wonders for my diabetic neuropathy , arthritic pain in hips , knees , shoulders , and hands.  My mother of 82 years has also found relief for the pains of old age.  Kratom is not addictive.  Its not something we use every day or even need to use every day.  I prefer to use this natural leaf over prescription drugs which had side effects that made it hard for me to be productive.  There is no psychotropic effect.

I am married with 2 children. Freshman and Senior at University. I carefully researched kratom prior to trying it 3 years ago for the first time. My rationale for trying kratom is the toxicity profile is superior to that of NSAIDs which can cause gastritis, increase risk of cardiac events and nephrotoxicity over time. My reason for switching from NSAIDs (i.e.. ibuprofen, naprosyn) to kratom is I run marathons frequently and run daily; so in my late 50s, I was taking quite a bit of ibuprofen for knee/hip pain. The analgesia provided by kratom is superior to that of NSAIDs with no GI distress, no nephrotoxicity and no increased cardiac events. I was so impressed after one year, that I recommended it to my father who is a retired cardiologist in his 80s who himself has cardiac issues, is on Plavix and can't take NSAIDs. Kratom works for him as well.\nI believe strongly that it is hypocritical to make an unprocessed plant Schedule I when alcohol and tobacco (which are quite destructive) are sold freely. Kratom is not a major euphoriant so I can't see rationale for \"banning\" it.\nI suspect some large pharmaceutical concern identified the potency of this plant and is trying to monetize it, turn it into a \"pill\" and make the base plant illegal to tie up the competition. I suspect the motive is purely financial. I respectfully request that kratom be left OTC. There is no pharmacologic reason to \"ban\" it. Thanks.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15542","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Im an ex heroin addict, mechanic with chronic pain and a father.

I'm also a recovered heroin addict of almost 3 years! \n\nIt scares me to think this plant which has made my recovery from heroin much easier might soon be considered an illegal drug.  Kratom is much like coffee.  Having kratom available to me makes even thinking about taking heroin seem crazy!  \n\nWhile I did not use kratom to come off heroin, because I didn't know about it at the time, I wish I would have.  I was detoxed at a state facility with benzodiazapam (xanax) which made my withdrawals even worse! I was hallucinating from a combination of opiate withdrawal and benzos prescribed by doctor.  However, I did manage to stay completely sober for 1 year, six months of which was in rehab.  I eventually relapsed on alcohol and xanax, it was a mess.  I was then introduced to kratom a few months later.  What a life saver! I take one dose a day, again much like coffee, and I feel ready to face the world.  When I run out of kratom I am fine, I do not withdrawal like from heroin. I can do without kratom, and I do often.  When my anxiety gets out of control, it comes to save the day!\n\nKratom has helped me to manage my anxieties and also my urges to take opiates like heroin or oxycontin.  It has helped me get my life together so I can manage being a productive and successful member of society like I have never been before!

The negative health effects of kratom compared to those of heroin or prescription pain killers pails in comparison. It is a safe and effective treatment for those suffering from pain or opiate addiction. To place it on list with heroin and other deadly drugs is not right. I believe that if many former heroine addicts who are now using kratom were to not be allowed to legally purchase the plant many could relapse back onto heroin.

In high school, I would wake up after 8 hours of sleep, get to first period, and fall back asleep again, many times without even realizing it. At 19 I was diagnosed with narcolepsy, so I finally had an explanation for why I was so tired. From puberty, I have struggled with the ability to stay asleep for more than a couple hours at a time. I have taken a number of different stimulants and sleep aids in my attempt to combat my excessive daytime sleepiness and inability to sleep through the night. None of those treatments worked. A friend introduced me to kratom this past year, and since I have started using it, I have been able to completely stop taking all of my prescription medications. I have the energy and motivation to get things done without the need for stimulants that make my heart race and leave me feeling sweaty, frazzled, and frankly, disgusting. I sleep straight through the night without waking up once, and I need less sleep than before to feel like I am at my best. In addition to keeping kratom legal, I sincerely think it should be looked to as a treatment for narcolepsy, as it carries an enormously lower risk of adverse effects when compared to the typical treatment options. Please do not take away the lifeline of someone who has tried all other options and not found relief.

I am a certified paramedic, college student, and Army ROTC cadet. In 2013 I had sprained my ankle due to a skateboarding accident and when I went to the hospital for this injury I was given a 30 count prescription of Oxycodone/ Acetaminophen (Percocet). Little did I know at that time that this bottle of 30 pills would set my life on a track that I had no intention of ever embarking on. I soon acquired a strong taste for any sort of opiate pain medication I could get my hands on. My casual usage soon became an all out addiction to pain medicine. I even went so far as to steal pain medicines from friends and families medicine cabinets. This story of addiction is a dime a dozen amongst Americans of all age groups and this epidemic is destroying our nation. In April of 2014, I could no longer find any source of opiate pain pills or cough medicine. I had alienated friends, family and my girlfriend at the time and the only thing on my mind was my ailing body, aches and pains and my hunger for some sort of high to bring relief to my addiction torn body. I was lost, failing my college courses, failing my family and failing myself. I had to reach a swift sobriety by the shear force of not being able to obtain any opiate substances. I ended up telling my parents everything i had done and I was somewhat sober for the few months to follow but I was always looking for Pills. I lied and said i wasn't but i would have paid anything to anyone to reach that high again. My close friends knew what i was going through and one of them mentioned Kratom as an alternative to prescription pain killers. He even showed my testimonies and online threads about how great this stuff was. \n\nMy first time taking kratom was nothing special and I could barely feel the effects of this herbal remedy, thus i wasn't sold on the idea. Little did i know that my opiate tolerance was so strong that i could have taken an ounce of Kratom Extract and not felt anything close to what i had come to expect from Oxycodone or Hydrocodone. I eventually experimented with different types and doses and started to feel some relief from my withdrawals. Not only did kratom take away my sickness but it motivated me to actually be productive. I was so confused by this feeling of drive that i was getting off of this green powder you buy at a sketchy smoke shop but the effects where real! \n\nI have been using kratom now for about 6 months and i havent had the desire to take any sort of opiate pain medication. In fact, one time I tried to take some oxycodone and the feeling it gave me felt so chemical and not natural that i felt sick. \n\nKratom has helped my Anxiety, My mood, My chronic aches and pains from previous accidents and most of all Kratom has completely rendered my addictive drive towards pain medication ineffective on me. \n\nWhen I first heard about the Kratom Ban proposed by the DEA I was heartbroken. I am a productive member of society and a high functioning member at that, and the prospect of losing this helpful aid that i have come to thank for my recent remission from opiates was very frustrating to comprehend. \n\nI beg the DEA and subsequent authorities to please reconsider this act to schedule kratom and rather lets make moves to research and better understand this herbal lifesaver. I know that I am not alone in my testimony to kratom and I urge others to share and fight to Save Kratom.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-5839","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Joshua Gallagher","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern.

Kratom is the most effective supplement I have used in this regard and has greatly contributed to a better quality of life for me.\n\nI have also witnessed friends overcome substance abuse problems with support from kratom. Though it does appear to affect the -opiate receptors, it is nothing like opiates or opioids in effect and has none of the negative issues (especially respiratory depression, but also the mental fogginess and potential for abuse). \n\nTo classify this harmless herb in the same category as heroin or cocaine makes little sense and there is really no good research to suggest it should be scheduled at all. I hope the voice of reason prevails as it would be a major blow to our civil liberties if a nearly harmless natural plant were made illegal.

I would appreciate it if you approve this natural supplement for recreational use and instead go after the pharmaceutical drug companies who lied about the addiction and the side effects of opioid drugs.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-12121","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Erica Walker","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a 61yr old widow. I watched as both my husband and my younger sister fell into prescription drug abuse, due to chronic pain. I lost them both, and fell into deep depression. Then I was hit by an 18-wheeler! I now suffer from chronic pain also along with other ailments. By all means I did not want to follow that path of addiction. A trap I found myself falling into. Then, I found Kratom 5 years ago and it saved my life. My quality of life has greatly improved and I no longer have to deal with narcotics and antidepressants or the many horrific side effects they bring (including suicidal thoughts). Kratom has saved my life! I do not wish to break the law. But my greatest fear is having Kratom scheduled or banned. Presently I care for my grandchildren and great-nephews so that their parents can work. I can only do this with the help of the kratom. Prescription medications made me a zombie and I was unable to care for myself much less the children until I found kratom. If I have to return to prescription medications that will affect the three families of the children I care for.

For years I have tried what seems to be every prescription to try and ease my symptoms, but there has always been side effects that were just as bad as the condition I was taking it for (one known side effect of ALL anti-depressants is suicide, which should tell you a little about how bad the side effects can be). A friend of mine who is an advocate of natural medicine suggested I try Kratom. I made some Kratom tea and within an extremely short amount of time I could feel it working. I felt \"normal\" with absolutely NO negative side effects. \nI cannot begin to tell you now much my quality of life has improved...\nI am a valued team member at my job and all of my friends and family have noticed the positive change in me.\nThis is just one of the beneficial uses of Kratom.

These benefits include: pain relief, energy/stimulation, immune system stimulation as well as depression, stress and anxiety relief. The rising popularity of kratom come primarily from these benefits.\n\nPain Relief\nKratom has been effectively used to treat pain by a large part of the population in countries where it has traditionally grown. The analgesic properties are one of the primary kratom benefits and this has been proven by that large number of people in western societies that have switched from powerful, dangerous prescription pain-killing drugs to simple plant leaves.\n\nKratom's pain-killing capabilities occur due to the unique blend of alkaloids that it contains. Some of the most important and effective for this purpose are 7-hydroxymitragynine and mitragynine. Both of these alkaloids are mu-opiod receptor agonists, very similar to the human body's own endorphins and enkaphalins.\n\nThrough this action at the mu-opiod receptors, it effectively nulls the body's perception of pain, which can dramatically increase the quality of life for those who deal with persistent pain.\n\nI use kratom almoat daily for over 2 years for chronic bakpain. It has made me be able to function at home and at work. I have also made tea for several individuals that wanted to get off heroinr, opiates, and methadone with great success. \nThis plant has the capability to help hundreds of thousands of people.  Let people decide for themselves and with more scientific research to help them use this plant.

I'm opposed to scheduling Kratom as a schedule 1 drug federally.  I've been using Kratom almost daily for the past 3 years to manage chronic pain due to degenerative disc disease, fibromyalgia, and various back surgeries.  About 6 years ago, my medical issues started to arise and my doctor immediately prescribed me various narcotics for pain and other issues.  Within that same 6 month period, I totaled a vehicle, lost many good friends, and essentially had to drop out of college because of the side effects these medications had on me.  I became bed ridden and depressed.  Eventually I sought drug treatment.  I ended up weaning off of those medications after they completely decimated my life, but between the withdrawals, and my physical pain coming back, it was a pretty miserable couple of years before I found Kratom.  I vowed to myself, I would never take another prescription opiate due to how much havoc it reeked on my life, again.\n\nFast forward two years, I couldn't take the pain I dealt with on a daily basis anymore.  I started researching natural, legal alternatives.. After trying many things over the course of a couple months, I recieved my first shipment of Kratom to try.  I was skeptical at first because as of this point, nothing had really worked for me quite yet.  I took a small dose and after an hour, I was pleasantly surprised.  I realized that I had close to no pain all of a sudden, I felt awake and alert, but I didn't even really notice Kratom take effect because there was no \"high\" or \"buzz\".  I continued to take Kratom for the past 3 or so years on a daily basis, taking breaks every couple of weeks. I've never felt withdraws when I've stopped taking it that even remotely come close to withdraws off of prescription opiates.  At most, a little bit of fatigue, and a couple nights of semi bad sleep.  It's no worse than stopping coffee or caffeine.  \nThe past 3 years I've used Kratom, my life has been the most productive, happy, and accomplishing time in my life.  I have a great job, I have my own place, I'm fully self supporting and not bed ridden.  I'm able to get back into college, and I'm able to enjoy the outdoors again.  Kratom allowed me to be a productive and responsible member of society.  If this plant became a schedule 1 drug, I would ultimately be back to square one in regards to finding that relief that Kratom gives me.  I absolutely refuse to go back to prescription narcotics due to how bad my quality of life was.  This ban will also effect 3-5 million other users.  Most people are using it for chronic pain, like myself, and also to get off of heavy opiates.  If you take this away from us, many will go back to the streets or their doctors and ultimately die due to overdose or face very critical life situations.  Kratom, in my opinion, is no worse than coffee or even drinking most herbal teas.  It should be regulated as such.  \n\nAgain, I think the DEA should reconsider scheduling Kratom as a schedule 1 drug.  I think that this ban will be counter intuitive to fighting the opioid and heroin epidemic that we currently face in the United States.  We're talking about 3-5 million lives here.  Please for once, look at the facts.  No deaths contributed to Kratom alone, and it has allowed many people to become productive members of society again.  The decision to not follow through with the ban is blatantly obvious.  You would be doing the United States a disservice by banning a miracle plant that saves lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1175","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Alan Weisman","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"As someone who has struggled with opiate addiction for many years in the past, and having exhausted every suggested route of state of the art pharmaceutical let down and scam, I stumbled across kratom.

I want to emphasize this NORMALIZ-ing  aspect of kratom, as it is the most important factor that set it apart from the less effective forms of opiate addiction treatment commonly prescribed like suboxone and methadone.

Kratom has benefitted my life in major ways physically, emotionally, and socially. I will further explain how in the following testimonial. \nHere is a little bit of back story as examples of how kratom assists in relief of my PTSD, anxiety, depression, and addiction. In 2011, my youngest son, James Dwight Sperry, was born via c-section with an Apgar score of 1. I was being prescribed norco, fioricet, Trazodone, and other medications while I was pregnant with him, thus making it difficult for him to breathe due to underdeveloped lungs. He was a fat, happy, grunty baby until January of 2012 when James caught pneumonia and RSV. Through a week in the hospital, James got a little better, but at the same time my youngest daughter Julia was being taken to the emergency room with what would be later called bacterial meningitis. This diagnosis went unknown for 8 months after. My James got sick again. This time he was being rushed to the emergency room, blue and grey from not being able to breathe, and a large blue/purple rash growing over his body. He was dying from meningococcal meningitis strand B. He had 5% chance of survival. It was there in the Pediatric ICU of Children's Hospital in Tulsa my 4 month old son would die in my arms hooked up to life support. My faith was shattered, my heart broken, and my addiction raged harder and stronger than it ever had been. I was lost in grief and PTSD. I quit my job of over a year. All I had were my living children and my pills.\n\nI also struggle with chronic pain. I am in the process of being diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlow syndrome. I also suffer from chonic migraine and fibromyalgia. These problems have been intensifying since I was 19 years old. I would wake up screaming in the middle of the night from the severe pain of RLS and neuropathy in my legs. To several doctors I have invisible illnesses and labeled as a \"drug seeker\". Currently I fear being seen in the ER and being treated poorly and not receiving quality medical care.\n\nFive months ago an acquaintance on Facebook sent me a message after reading the struggles I was having in becoming sober from opiates and barbituates. She told me about kratom and how successful she had been after many years of sobriety herself. I was skeptical at first that a supplement or cup of tea had the answer to my problems. Since the beginning I was told this is not a \"cure-all\" but would ease my issues and enhance my quality of life. She was not wrong!\nI ordered kratom for the first time in May of 2016. My pain level went from a morning 8 to a manageable 2, due to the mu-opioid inhibitors and analgesic effects that is similar to the effects to a large cup of coffee but without the jitters. I take this alongside turmeric and black pepper, which also are known to be natural anti-inflammatories with many other health benefits.  In the first month of drinking kratom tea, and with the help of my neurologist, I was able to quit taking all opiates and barbituates. I still continue to take prescribed medications and have regular visits with several specialists and my primary care physician, but kratom has been a great addition to my daily regimen.\n\nNow my family and friends can trust me and the grief has been a little easier to bear. I still mourn for my son and feel the pains of my medical issues; however, with the healthier living with the added benefits of kratom, I can function. I am a successful parent to my living children, and a trusted daughter caring for my stepfather with cancer, as well as my 96-year-old grandfather. My friends and family have noticed the difference. That's all it takes for me to know something works in a positive way. Thank you for your time and taking our quality of life into consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1365","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jennifer Haney","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am a professional who has a Master's degree and has been employed consistently for the past five years and have been using kratom regularly for about two years.

I have never been healthier in my life. If this herb is taken away from me and my family I honestly don't know what will happen.

Please do not make mitragyna speciosa a prescription medication, (scheduled or otherwise), do not ban it, and do not take the plant material, as a whole, off the market.\n- Further research is needed!\n- There are non prescription substances like alcohol, coffee, Tylenol, and tobacco which cause death where as  kratom does not have one recorded death, over hundreds of years, from sole use.\n- Kratom does not suppress respiration according to an American Chemical Society article. \n- Kratoms toxic effects included nausea, dizziness, and unpleasant effects according to Kratom Science.\n- Kratom may cause dependence like alcohol, tobacco, and coffee but it does not cause dependence or tolerance as quickly as opiates do according to a study published by J Med Chemistry.\n- Kratom, as a whole, contains many alkaloids that work together to create the effects that help so many. Do not reduce it down to two alkaloids and think that those two on thier own will help as many people as the plant as a whole does.\n- Yes, pharmaceutical companies have a obligation to create better products besides opiates and they will still make money from the people who will live a better life because of their research, but there are so many others who benefit from kratom that will not fit the profile for a pharmaceutical drug created because kratom is a useful tool for so much more then just pain.\n- Kratom contains alkaloids that have are antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, immune boosting, antioxidant, anti diabetic, and antiseptic qualities, just to name a few, as described in a article found on Kratom Science.\n- Approve kratom as a supplement.\n\n2. Yes to regulation as for quality control measures and limit use for only informed adult consent.\n- There is a lack of quality control measures for adulterants and fake product. If there is any hazard coming from kratom, it is this. Please help regulate these things.\n- Please create standards, uniformly, across the market that assure us of quality standards.\n- Let consenting, informed adults (18-21 and up) make the decision on what to put in their bodies. If there is not risk of death, properly label products with known side effects so they may make their own choice on positives outweighing the negatives or vice versa.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStacy Lum","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15429","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stacy Lum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have been a daily kratom user now for over 18 months.

I am a 33 year old disabled veteran and student.  I served two tours in Iraq/Kuwait and was honorable discharged in 2008 under medical conditions.  In short, the Army wasnt equipped to handle the mental health issues I had developed.  The few years after were spent abusing drugs, in and out of jail, isolation, and despair. The VA basically experimented on me. Ive been prescribed at one time or another: doxepin, quetiapine, mirtazapine, bupropion, trazodone, lorazepam, clonazepam, fluoxetine, prazosin, gabapentin, sertraline, aripiprazole, zolpidem and many more.  Many of these were SSRIs that exacerbated a condition I already had called Restless Legs Syndrome, causing an endless cycle of sleepless nights and zombie-like days. In the midst of this I was treated for chronic back and knee pain and TBI. I developed an addiction to pain pills and quickly had nothing.  \n\tGetting off of all that wasnt easy.  I was failing when I discovered Kratom.  I am no doctor and cannot make claims above my paygrade, but I can say this. Drinking a cup of tea in the morning, and a cup at night, not only allowed me to get off all of those medications, but also treated the symptoms of my chronic pain and fatigue.  The endless cycle of opiate dependence was finally over. \n\tIn the years since, I graduated my community college Suma with my Associates in Psychology, and I am currently attending Temple University to pursue a Masters in Clinical Psychology.   This isnt any kind of miracle.  I made positive life choices, and I worked hard for change. There is no substitute for the wiliness to change, but there are tools that can help people who have made that decision. We must make these tools readily available to those who NEED them. That is why when there is a plant available, which supports the process of recovery and future treatment of pain, it must remain available.  Is there any Natural Right more important than the right of man to use nature; to grow our medicine and food?   \n        It was and has never been personally addictive.  I was able to use it during my detox from the poison the VA had me on, and then stop its use.  Now I use it periodically for pain or hypervigilance.  \n        This is a serious matter that involves powers much greater than me, but Ive been given the chance to voice my opinion on something that Im passionate about. In this situation, one must weigh the benefits to society against the possible negatives.  Here I implore you to listen to the many of us who have had our lives changed positively by this plant.  It is possible to come to a common sense solution. This can be a great time for experimentation and economic growth, or another failed attempt at prohibition.  I for one hope the latter doesn't happen.  I don't know what I would do.  \n\n\nSincerely, \n\nMatthew Loggins","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-1944","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-27T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Matthew Loggins","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi, I'm a 41 year old female with 3 kids and 3 step kids.

After seven months of additional pills from my friend I was way over my head and spent the next 10 years spending every penny I made buying pills on the street, it was hell. \nFinally, I entered a suboxon treatment program that I attended for 2 years before completing. The biggest benefit to this program was that I was able to overcome the psychological drug seeking tendicys that were always shadowed by my physical withdrawal. At the end of the 2 year program I tapered of suboxon and within a month returned to prescription opiates, I was still addicted to a strong opiate via suboxon. After 3 months of a growing pill addiction I discovered Kratom. I was on Kratom for 3 months before successfully tapering off and have been free of all opiates for a year. In my experience Kratom treated my addiction in the same way as suboxon but without the presence of a strong opiate. Looking back I consider Kratom as a stepping stone to my recovery and don't think I would be where I am without it. After being part of this opiate epidemic I can attest that there aren't enough treatment options for people so taking one away will only hurt people who are already suffering.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-16788","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"ANONYMOUS ANONYMOUS","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I use kratom for anxiety and depression,and also for physical pain.

Know where to begin with talking about how Kratom has positively effected my life.\n\nA few years ago I suffered a TBI while in the Military. I was an Army Ranger with 3rd battalion 75th ranger regiment. After 3 years out of my 5 year contract something happened. I had just graduated ranger school and my body wouldn't work.\n\nI was 23 years hold and all of a sudden metabolically damaged, depressed, out of shape, and couldn't get an erection. I figured it was just the effects of ranger school and all the other training throughout my career this far and it would get better with time.\n\nThen 2 months passed. Then 5.  Then Almost a year. Finally I started seeking help. How could I be 23 years old and formally have a great life- amazing physical shape, a determined and positive mindset, and caring for others. To nothing. To unmotivated, social anxiety, scared to get out of bed and face the day.\n\nI found kratom from the recommendation of a friend. It helped give me the courage to get up and face the day. To get back to training. To stay out of trouble. To help others.  All things that were slowly slipping away.\n\nMy brain was working again. I could think and not be in a fog all day. I began researching. I still wasn't able to get erections. I went and got bloodwork done. My testosterone was at 16ng/dl. The average male is 330-1100 ng/dl.\n\nI got out on testosterone replacement therapy. A step I would have never taken without the help of kratom. I got some mri's taken to see why at 23 that I was feeling how I was. My pituitary gland had shut down. I suffered a TBI thoughout my years in the Military.  The pituitary controls your output and control of other organs and hormones. It shut down my thyroid, which also wasn't working. \n\nI worked with a physician and have gotten all these fixed and feel like a new person. Everyday I wake up grateful for finding kratom and helping get me out of the toughest spot in my life. One where I was suicidal and scared of the world.\n\nI have since left the military. I still have problems with proprioception and balance but kratom helps keep me motivated everyday. I'm currently working on starting a successful digital marketing business and if, while working with my doctor, can get everything in check. I would love to continue to serve this amazing conuntry. Even if it's just the reserves.\n\nLuckily kratom was legal and got me out of that spot, otherwise I'm sure I wouldn't be here and able to make the impact I know I am creating for others. Everyday I wake up and make it my goal to help at least 1 person. Whether it's in business or someone not able to eat.\n\nPlease keep kratom legal so myself and others who find themselves in dire situations can find the strength to rise up and help contribute to the world instead of being it down.\n\nThank you for your time .","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20469","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jeremy Berardi","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"A little bit of information about the substance for the uneducated  government condemning those Whoms rights and liberties it was instituted to protect. You work for us. we are the nation, not your organization. Now uphold our will. Kratom is harmless, organic and a right of any living thing to possess, purchase, distribute and consume.\n\nKratom Leaves\nNative to Southeast Asia, kratom is a tropical deciduous tree that is widely used throughout the region for medicinal purposes. The scientific name of this evergreen tree is Mitragyna speciosa, and it has had a very interesting history, including being banned in Thailand (despite being indigenous there), as it was a natural substitute for opium, thereby affecting the economy of the country. Also, there is no addictive quality of kratom leaves, which is very valuable given some of its long-term applications for human health.\nThe majority of the health benefits of kratom leaves are derived from the unique chemical compounds and nutrients found within the leaves of the plant, including a wide range of alkaloids and other organic substances that affect many of the organ systems of the human body. The plants leaves are widely chewed in countries where the tree grows naturally, and some high estimates suggest that up to 70% of the male population of Thailand chew anywhere from 10-60 leaves each day. The calming, soothing effects, as well as the undeniable health benefits of the leaves, are clearly positive in nature, which is what causes such a controversy. Essentially, kratom leaves are a substitute for opium, a highly addictive and dangerous drug, yet these leaves are seen as perfectly harmless, as regular as having a snack between meals. Now, lets take a closer look at some of the fascinating health benefits of kratom leaves.\n\nHealth Benefits of Kratom Leaves\nPain Relief: One of the most obvious and widely known effects of kratom leaves is pain relief. Since the leaves were first introduced to their indigenous cultures, this has been a primary use, as the analgesic properties of the alkaloids and nutrients of the leaves can quickly relieve pain throughout the body by impacting the hormonal system. By increasing the amount of serotonin and dopamine that is released into the body, pain can be alleviated (or masked) by chewing on kratom leaves. Essentially, the alkaloids dull the pain receptors throughout the body. This morphine or opium-like quality of kratom leaves is widely regarded as its most important application.\nImmune System Booster: Independent studies on the various alkaloids found in kratom leaves have shown that the combinative effects can have major effects on the strength and resilience of the immune system. While this research is still being qualified and checked, traditional and anecdotal beliefs about kratom leaves show that it can reduce the severity of illnesses or prevent illness altogether.\nEnergy Booster: The metabolic effects that kratom has is one of the other reasons that the leaves are so popular, particularly with laborers in various countries. It can increase your energy levels by optimizing certain metabolic processes and impacting hormone levels. This is a result of increased circulation, despite its soothing nature, and a general increase in oxygenated blood to areas of the body that needs it, combining with increased metabolic activities to provide a burst of energy. For sufferers of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, kratom leaves are often an alternative, natural solution.\nSexual Stimulant: This is seen particularly in the case of sexual libido and fertility. Kratom is seen by many traditional practitioners and users as an aphrodisiac and a fertility booster, as the extra energy and blood flow can help increase fertility, re-energize a tired libido, and improve duration/conception rates.\nAnxiety and Mood Swings: As you can probably imagine, any substance that is able to relieve pain and cause opium-like effects on the body will also likely have an impact on the mental stability and tone of an individual. Kratom leaves are widely used as anxiolytic substances for people who suffer from chronic stress, depression, anxiety, and mood swings. By regulating the hormones in our body, people can finally get relief from these exhausting symptoms of a chemical imbalance without having to rely on pharmaceuticals and all of the implicit side effects of those drugs.\nAddiction Recovery: Due to the inherently healthy nature of kratom leaves, in combination with their range of effects, they have been used as a method of curing addiction for hundreds of years. In many cultures, opium addiction is a major issue, but regularly chewing on kratom leaves provides a similar sensation without the comedowns and negative side effects. Therefore, when people are attempting to get clean and stay that way, they often turn to kratom leaves as a tolerable solution.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9241","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"CITIZEN OF AMERICA","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Richard Lesko, I'm 68 years old and am semi-retired.

The so-called \"accordion effect\" crushed my heels (one was completely removed) and feet and travelled upward breaking one leg up to the knee and flattening two lower back vertebra; one wrist was demolished trying to grab the roof on my way down to an asphalt parking lot. Twelve major reconstructive surgeries (4-10 hours long each), a year in two hospitals and another in the hell of assisted living (I was 49 at the time) and 10 years later I'm still a wreck. Mainly from the daily varied degrees of pain influenced by changes in barometric pressure and humidity via the 133 screws, five large titanium plates and something akin to a coiled bicycle chain where my left heel used to be. You know the rest and surely don't need to endure any more of that end of my story. \n\nOf course over the past 10 years I've ridden a slew of opioid painkillers, down from the Matterhorn of my hospital Fentanyl drip addiction in 2006 to the 2-3 low-dose 15 mg. morphine sulfate pills I require today to live independently, the lowest dosage these are produced in. I'm almost there, off the pills, and my comment is regarding but the hope Kratom presents toward ending my long-time dependence on morphine. I only very recently even heard of it, particularly hopeful reading that many others like me are kicking their painkiller addiction thanks to this natural substance. But, the same day I finally located outlets selling Kratom in my area, I also learned that the DEA was removing it from their shelves. I met someone at that shop in tears over the news, a fellow Rx addict who like me had just discovered the hope that Kratom apparently offers people like us. I cried too.\n\nSo, having never even been able to try Kratom, my comment is all about hope. I hope the DEA does indeed, as of December 1st this year, decide to reverse its prior (and apparently premature) action. If only that I--and all those millions of others like me addicted to dangerous prescription narcotics for real, severe pain control, not those just seeking a doctor-approved Rx high--may have even at least the hope of using Kratom to finally complete our downhill rides off our Matterhorns. Hope is everything to those, like me, just trying to remain independent enough (and out of assisted living) to do our own laundry, groceries etc. Please give us hope. Please, I beg you, reverse this temporary ban on Kratom which gives me hope, that's all I ask. Do the proper research studies, handle this issue with care knowing just how many of us out here need HOPE. \n\nThank you, sincerely --\nRandy Alberts\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0039","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Randy Alberts","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please dont ban Kratom.

I also read up on new medications hitting the market. As well as knowing common herbs that my patients may take. Going to college, being a mother, and working full time was a very tough struggle but so worth it.\n\nA year ago, test showed I was suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis on top of half a lifetime of diabetes that led to excrutiating nerve damage. Needless to say, I had to give up my career helping mankind because of debilitating pain. I went through every OTC pain medication imaginable until it created damage to my stomach, requiring prescription medication. That turned in to Gabapentin, which turned in to Lyrica, which turned in to narcotics. I know what narcotics do to people. I couldn't see myself being a nurse needing narcotics four times a day, every day. I didn't want a life of narcotics! \n\nI do daily stretching exercises and Tai Chi. I go for Caudal Epidural Steroid Injections. And I have found kratom after doing my research. There is nothing \"recrational\" about it. There is no \"high\". There is a significant reduction in my pain, with all measures considered. \n\nComing off of any narcotic is difficult and my heart goes out to the men and women who faced their addictions. With the help of kratom they were able to end their addictions. Anywhere from Tramadol to heroin. They became productive members of society. Off of our welfare system. Children in safe homes with their parents. Wow. All naturally. So why ban it?\n\nThis summer a friend of mine sent me an article from Vice News (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts) about kratom, a natural substance known for its pain relieving qualities. Could this be another way to manage my pain? Maybe this would replace or cut out other pain meds that I use. I took to the internet to obtain facts, check on addiction rates and understand how to ingest kratom. Here are some of the facts I found (with references) that made me decide that I would try kratom as one of many branches in managing chronic pain.\n\nIt is known to be a natural analgesic, muscle relaxer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant (http://www.vice.com/read/why-banning-the-controversial-painkiller-kratom-could-be-bad-news-for-americas-heroin-addicts). I currently three medications that address these issues.\n\nThose with multiple sclerosis, back pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and Lyme disease have reported relief when using kratom.\nThere have been a limited number of deaths attributed solely to kratom. Only 15 reported in the last 10 years. The majority of overdoses where kratom is present, other drugs and alcohol were all contributing factors.  Unlike opioids, kratom does not suppress the breathing function, which is an element of overdosing.\nThese findings led me to try kratom. After trying different strains and dosing, I can say that my pain level decreases. I have not found any medication that completely takes away my pain. Kratom definitely knocks my pain down a few levels and gives me about 4-5 hours of relief. I found that it gives me a little boost, allowing me to be more productive. I have been pleased with the results and love that kratom is less toxic than opioids.\n\nOver 100,000 Americans signed a petition (including myself) to halt the DEAs two-year ban on kratom. During the temporary ban, the DEA would conduct studies on this natural supplement. To me, it makes more sense to conduct studies and then come to a conclusion on whether or not to ban kratom. It clearly helps at least 100,000 manage their pain in an era where taking any type of opioid is completely taboo. People with pain matter. Completely blocking access to kratom will have a direct impact on those who responsibly take pain medications to deal with a chronic medical issue.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the DEA to halt the ban until further studies can be performed. I believe that I represent the majority of patients with chronic pain who use opioids. We are responsible and educated. Yes, there is an opioid epidemic in this country. However, taking away a natural supplement that could replace an opioid as pain management doesnt make any sense","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23156","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Amy Polak","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hey guys, not cool.

By arbitrarily banning kratom, a safer alternative to opiates is removed from the marketplace, thus creating a situation for those with addictions to seek solutions elsewhere.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9861","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Luis Rivera","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\nMy name is Mike Schurr, I am 38 years old and currently employed in a technical field for a large aerospace corporation.\n\nI oppose the DEA's efforts to make Kratom a Schedule 1 substance due to the two main active alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. Please understand that by placing this medicinal plant on a schedule 1 substances list, you will effectively be outlawing an herbal supplement that has helped me and some of my family members relieve moderate pain from various medical conditions from which we suffer. Kratom has helped me personally with minor to moderate muscle aches as well as with occasional depression and has also helped me maintain my energy during times of fatigue. When I take Kratom, I do not feel intoxicated nor is my judgment, motor skills, or impulses affected. Also, I do not ever have any withdrawal symptoms after taking Kratom. I prefer taking Kratom to taking other prescription or over the counter medicines due to their potential side effects and also because of my personal philosophy in which I believe in seeking out a herbal and/or natural remedy as a first step in personal health management during times of illness or injury.\n\nKratom should stay available because it has been effective for me and others in my family who suffer with pain and has done so at a lower financial and personal health cost than using traditional pharmaceutical and over the counter medications. I personally began using Kratom when researching herbal cures for aches, depression, and low energy. The end result of that research was an informational web page which described the benefits of Kratom and how they could help my specific health issues. I ordered a small amount not expecting too much but began to realize after two small doses of about 4 grams each, that it seemed to work better than any herbal, prescription, or over the counter medication that I had previously taken. It has also helped my wife alleviate her period cramps, and my father with his chronic back and joint problems. \n\nMaking Kratom Schedule 1 is effectively outlawing it by putting it in a class of substance equal to heroin with similar penalties for possession, use, or sale. This would effectively make people like myself, members of my family, and many others across America like us into a criminal class for using a natural herbal supplement to manage their own health. We don't deserve that, as an American, part of the freedom of living in this great nation is  for making personal health choices that have had real positive effects on our lives.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-20926","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Michael Schurr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I've been an opiate addict nearly my entire adult life.

It is likely safer than coffee. Yet it is effective for many people for many reasons: it can help ease anxiety and depression and fatigue, it has mild analgesic effects and can safely treat mild to moderate pain, and has proven effective in helping people manage addictions to more dangerous substances like alcohol and strong opiates. \n\nBanning kratom at this point would be like banning coffee. It's already widely in use, it's proven to be very low risk and is effective. Individuals treated for negative outcomes at hospitals who are found to have kratom in their systems inevitably have multiple other drugs in their systems that better explain their symptoms.

There is a move by the DEA to emergency schedule Kratom (an herbal supplement, that contains no synthetics)  as a schedule 1 controlled substance. Schedule 1 is the most restrictive category claiming no medicinal value. Heroin is a schedule 1 controlled substance!  Kratom, the leaves of a plant, simply does not belong in this category!\nKratom has been used safely throughout the world for hundreds of years as a natural pain reliever, and mild mood elevator. Kratom is a relative of the coffee plant, and kratom leaves do give me an energy boost, similar to a cup of coffee, except without the jitters.  This herbal supplement allows those with chronic pain to choose the unadulterated leaves of a plant (instead of a narcotic) to eliminate pain.  \nI am a 50-year-old woman, a productive citizen, currently going back to school to get my Master's Degree in clinical mental health counseling.  I have over 3 years of recovery from addiction to pain medication, after an auto accident damaged my spine, and caused permanent nerve damage.  I can't take narcotics.  Over the counter pain meds don't work for me.   Kratom helped give me my life back and is helping thousands of people in the U.S. to avoid narcotics during an opioid epidemic. \nPlease consider the thousands of us who would prefer to take an herbal supplement over vicodin, morphine, dilaudid, oxycodone and heroin! I don't want to become a felon for purchasing an herbal supplement.  This product does not make me high.  I am no longer a drug and alcohol user.  I have been clean for 3 years, and kratom has helped me to stay clean because of its pain relieving benefits. Additionally, it helps relieve chronic pain without the intestinal upset that naproxen and ibuprofen cause at the high doses I would need to take of those pain relievers if it were not for kratom. \n\nThanks so much for your time,\nStephanie Sweda Montgomery\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-19846","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stephanie C Montgomery","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I do not personally use Kratom more than a few times a month but have seen so many people reap the benefits of this wonderful leaf.

Finally I am in favor of keeping kratom legal simply due to the fact that their is no hard evidence that can be shown otherwise.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14735","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Fatih Gungor","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I suffer from debilitating anxiety and depression.

The dosage of my medicine was cut down last year and I do not wish to go to a pain-management doctor to increase my dosage.  I am quite concerned, through study, that the effects of acetaminophen, which constitutes a large part of my medicine, is not good for the body. \n\nKratom merely constitutes the leaves of a tree that grows very large and helps the environment and people.

I've always been very patriotic, telling my students that this was the best country.  And I've always been very law-abiding.  Even though I grew up in 1960's, I've never even tried an illegal drug: not marijuana, not anything.\n\nBut my faith in this country's institutions has been severely shaken by the DEA's attempt to ban kratom.  I started using kratom to sooth my restless legs, which had started keeping me up at night, and had begun making my airplane trips across country to visit my grandchildren intolerable.  By now, I've been using it for almost four years.  It's a miracle herb for me.  I don't feel high on it.  I don't get nauseous.  I don't have any side effects at all.  I take it and feel . . . nothing.  It completely takes away the squirmy feeling in my legs that had been making the life torturous.  \n\nAfter the DEA's announcement that it planned to make kratom a Schedule 1 drug, I asked my doctor for some Rx meds to control the RLS.  She gave me gabapentin, saying it was one of the safest drugs.  Well, perhaps it is, but not for me.  Within two week I started feeling breathless all the time, and since I have asthma, this is a show-stopper side-effect for me.  So I started tapering off of it, which was horrible just in itself.  I got severe pain, and the breathlessness continued.  In fact, it continued for three weeks after I stopped the drug completely.  Oh, and it didn't even do anything for the RLS symptoms.  \n\nSo I'm back to taking kratom again, and asking you to please, please leave it as a herb we can order as we need it.  I've figured out myself how much to take, and when to take it to control the RLS symptoms.  I don't need a doctor doling out leaves to me.  I'm a grown-up.  I've given years of military service to this country, and years and years of service to my students.  I don't think it's too much to ask to be treated as a responsible adult.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-2250","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Mary Leonhardt","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have high functioning autism and a nerve disorder called HNPP.

It is a miracle plant that has a wide array of benefits that I have been unable to find in any other single plant or medicine. It is entirely natural, and I haven't experienced any negative side effects in the 3 years I have used it. It has alleviated menstrual cramps and headaches, calmed anxiety, lifted my mood when I feel depressed, helped me get more restful sleep, and is a healthier energy boost alternative to caffeine. To place this natural plant with other schedule 1 drugs would be a tragedy. It has helped so many people get off of unnatural substances, such as pharmaceutical medications, which have serious side effects. To take away our freedom to have this plant would be utterly preposterous. It is a plant. It was put here by nature, and we should have to the choice to use what nature has put here for us. To make this benefical plant illegal with the amount of chemicals and substances that are allowed for human consumption to remain legal, might lead one to believe laws are in place to take away what is natural and good, while encouraging what is detrimental, addictive, and possibly lethal- such as prescription drugs. Compare the death tolls of prescription drugs and alcohol to Kratom and let those speak for what should really be classified as a schedule 1 drug. Even laundry detergent and other household cleaning agents are more lethal than Kratom. Why are those allowed? It seems the governments real intention is not to give people what will be healthy and good, but what will give them a slow deterioration leading to death. At least that is one could be lead to believe if Kratom gets classified as a schedule 1 substance, while those other more toxic substances are allowed to remain legal. People should have a say in this. Our voices need to be heard, and should be the determining factor on this decision. Government should not be in place to control and manipulate people while taking away their basic rights, such as using plant medicine, and giving us toxic chemicals. Government should be doing it's best to ensure the health and wellbeing of it's people. If we are saying this is helping us, that needs to be listened to.

I have degenerative issues in my neck that cause extreme pain and can only be solved via surgery that only has a 50% success rate. For many people, that surgery leaves them with far more pain than they had when they started. I am also a fibromyalgia sufferer. I am a full-time, stay at home/home schooling parent for my very active 12 year old son. Pharmaceutical pain medicine helps to some degree, but as the restrictions on prescribing become more and more stringent, and doctor's hands become more tied, I think it's only right that people have options. Kratom is one of those options. I use it on days when my pain medicine is just not cutting it. Normally on days like that I would be bed ridden- unable to do laundry, stand in the kitchen to cook a meal, or tutor my son- the pain is that intense. Kratom helps bring that pain down to a more manageable level and helps me lead a more normal life. Surgery is not an option for me right now. Kratom is and I'm grateful for it.\n\nThe other chronic pain sufferers I have met do not use Kratom to get high- we're not a bunch of partying high school kids looking to get buzzed. We are middle to older aged folks who need pain relief and use it responsibly. Please do not take away a safe and well-loved  plant that gives us a chance to live decent, productive lives.

I am not a drug abuser - I do not even smoke or drink alcohol. I am a husband to a loving wife & a supportive father of 2 grown adult sons who have all seen the difference this plant has made in my quality of life, and as a result their lives have been changed. I am a grandfather to 3 beautiful grandchildren who have been fortunate enough to have never seen the suffering that was endured prior to discovering this affordable, healthy alternative to pharmaceuticals that cost thousands of dollars, are much less effective, and far more dangerous! I did much research on kratom for several months and discovered that there are far more positive effects than negative. The most serious negative side effects I found was nausea and vomiting from consuming too much of the plant and mild tolerance /dependence developing with repeated daily use - the same side effects profile of coffee (to which this plant is botanically related). I did not find a single documented incident of a death occurring as a direct result of consuming mitragyna speciosa alone. Granted, I am no scientist or doctor but much of the research I read was authored by qualified professionals so I was comfortable in making the decision to try this as a solution to my heath issues. It has turned out to be one of the wisest decisions I have ever made. Needless to say, I was shocked to read the claims made in the DEA's notice of intent to justify this scheduling action. The few reported deaths that are being cited were caused by a supposed \"legal high\" product that \"contained\" kratom mixed with other man-made chemicals. \n\nThere are people who will find a way to abuse anything. Some profiteers have attempted to abuse this plant by extracting 2 of the leaf's 20+ alkaloids to sell as a \"legal high\". In the DEA's notice of intent, this seams to be the reasoning behind taking this action. Research has proven that the whole leaf in its unadulterated form poses no threat to public health and has helped many people live with and recover from debilitating mental and physical health conditions. Consideration should be given to all of the facts before making such an important decision that will cause untold numbers of honest, law abiding citizens to suffer (and many to die) simply because the DEA is trying to stop the irresponsible actions of a small minority of abusers. These people who are irresponsibly marketing kratom as a \"legal high\" and those who are abusing it will move on to abuse something else - things far more dangerous. There are actions that can be taken to address the abuse issue without ruining the lives of the majority. I can only pray that common sense will prevail and the DEA will take this seriously and understand the consequences of allowing this to happen.

The only thing I have ever been able to take in moderation is kratom.  Whenever I have a craving for alcohol or I have an anxiety problem I take a tablespoon of green borneo or red bali kratom.  It calms my nerves and sees to be much safer than alcohol or drugs.  I have never done anything criminal to get kratom when I run out because the withdrawal is not a huge deal.  Most people who use illicit drugs keep breaking the law because their withdrawals are too bad too manage.  With kratom, that is not the case.  You will do far more damage to yourself and the community with alcohol and alcohol is legal.  It's highly unlikely, for someone that doesn't significantly over use it, to hurt themselves.  It should be taken in moderation and it is easy to do so because kratom comes to a point where taking more is not really pleasant anymore so it forces a person to take in moderation.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7587","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Curtis Slagowski","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I have always been one to turn to alcohol.

It has changed my life. It helps me to be more outgoing, happy, and able to move without debilitating pain due to sacroiliac dysfunction. I still use the same amount I started out using two years ago. My comments are as follows.\n\n1. Please do not make mitragyna speciosa a prescription medication, (scheduled or otherwise), do not ban it, and not take the plant as a whole, off the market.\n- Further research is needed!\n- There are non prescription substances like alcohol, coffee, Tylenol, and tobacco which cause death where as kratom does not have one recorded death, over hundreds of years, from sole use.\n- Kratom does not suppress respiration according to an American Chemical Society article. \n- Kratoms toxic effects included nausea, dizziness, and unpleasant effects according to Kratom Science.\n- Kratom may cause dependence like alcohol, tobacco, and coffee but it does not cause dependence or tolerance as quickly as opiates do according to a study published by J Med Chemistry.\n- Kratom, as a whole, contains many alkaloids that work together to create the effects that help so many. Do not reduce it down to two alkaloids and think that those two on thier own will help as many people as the plant as a whole does.\n- Yes, pharmaceutical companies have a obligation to create better products besides opiates and they will still make money from the people who will live a better life because of their research, but there are so many others who benefit from kratom that will not fit the profile for the pharmaceutical drug created because it is used for so much more then just pain.\n- Kratom contains alkaloids that have are antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, immune boosting, antioxidant, anti diabetic, antiseptic, and more qualities as described in a article found on Kratom Science.\n- Approve kratom as a supplement.\n\n2. Yes to regulation as for quality control measures and limit use for only informed adult consent.\n- There is a lack of quality control measures for adulterants and fake product. If there is any hazard coming from kratom, it is this. Please help regulate these things.\n- Please create standards, uniformly, across the market that assure us of quality standards.\n- Let consenting, informed adults (18-21 and up) make the decision on what to put in their bodies. If there is not risk of death, properly label products with known side effects so they may make their own choice on positives outweighing the negatives or vice versa.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStacy Lum","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15472","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Stacy Lum","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"My name is Eugene Ferryman.\n\nI am in favor of keeping Kratom legal in the United States.\n\nThank you very much.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-14119","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymus Anonymus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom it may concern:\n\nI have neurofibromatosis, a genetic condition.

Oh i know,,because of money...it makes me sick..bottom line kratom helps people incredibly more than it hurts them.  Opiate abuse is a worldwide health crisis and we need to start helping and informing people of the truth about it.  I hope that you sincerely take this into consideration.

I am a 64 year old female. I am a small business owner, in partnership with my husband and employing one additional person part time. My work as an interpersonal process consultant requires my attention, sustained energy and full mental faculties in order to adequately serve my clients in the public and private sectors and preserve my livelihood. I have used Kratom for two months daily, starting with .5 teaspoons twice daily to my present preferred dosage of 1 teaspoon twice daily with meals, sometimes increasing to a third dose in the evening. The use of Kratom has improved my mood and attentiveness and noticeably raised my energy level. This is without any kind of stomach distress or queasiness, or feelings of giddiness or hyper-activity. The effects, while distinct, are also pleasantly mild. I use two varieties of powdered Kratom, \"Red Maeng Da\" in the morning and \"Green Vein\" in the second half of the day or evening.  \n\nIn the last several years I have suffered increasingly from depression, periodic anxiety, lack of energy and generalized fatigue. I have had to manage my daily routines to accommodate periods of low energy and I believe I have been unable to grow my business to its potential because of this. These symptoms are naturally exacerbated by the stress of being witness to my husband's condition of daily chronic pain for which he is treated with a Schedule 2 painkiller (he will separately return his own comments on his positive experience with Kratom with regard to easing pain, reducing prescription drug dosage and slightly elevating mood - since I have no access to his direct experience of pain I will not comment further on the benefits to him). \n\nIn the past two years, I had felt sufficiently mild to moderate discomfort and occasional distress from my depressive symptoms that I asked my primary care physician to prescribe an anti-depressant and have been prescribed Sertraline. I not started to use it due my strong concerns over the fact that my physician informed me that the use of an anti-depressant creates initial negative symptoms such as queasiness and nausea, and dependency such that discontinuing it for any reason requires a step-down managed by my physician. This concern is strongly underlined by my past, very negative experience with Trazodone prescribed by my M.D. for sleeplessness. The Trazodone (in a small dosage which I do not remember), which I understand to be primarily intended for use in treating depression and anxiety, caused me to feel very significantly increased irritability, anxiety, very uncharacteristically negative thoughts and a deeply negative emotional state. These symptoms ceased when I stopped using Trazodone after about three weeks when I could not isolate any other chemical or behavioral change that would explain the strong symptoms. To clarify, I am not suicidal, nor have I ever had suicidal thoughts, including during the time I experienced the strong negative reaction to Trazodone. The only prescription drug I take is Zolpidem for sleep, which works moderately well (2.5 mg once daily at bedtime). Kratom has provided relief of the symptoms for which I sought help, and allowed me to avoid the use of an anti-depressant.\n\nThe use of Kratom has taken care of the depressive symptoms to a very significant degree. I feel relieved of the worst symptoms and sufficiently stable in a generalized feeling of wellbeing such that I can much more easily manage periods of stress from life events. This feeling of wellbeing in no way separates me from my concerns about my business responsibilities and my concern for family and community. These remain unchanged; I simply feel better able to deal with them in a relaxed, calm and competent manner. The positive effects of the Kratom for my husband's chronic pain managment also affect my daily mood, since his pain is slightly more manageable and his mood is thereby improved, it improves life for me as well, as someone who cares for a loved one in pain.\n\nI ask the DEA to consider very carefully the consequences of removing a substance from public access that provides relief without, in my case, negative effects. There are very few avenues open to people who suffer from pain and its attendant anxieties and for their loved ones and caregivers. Rather than close off a promising and effective avenue, I request that the DEA NOT change the rules such that this substance would become unavailable to researchers and to consumers by placing it into Schedule I.

Do we consider drinking a cup of coffee in the morning abuse, or having a beer after work abuse? Why is it that ingesting these substances is okay, but consuming a certain plant is not? What makes society okay with consuming certain substances, but not others? These decisions are not made based upon logic, the true harm to a person or society at large, or science; they are based upon  opinions and arbitrary decisions.\n\nKratom is an internationally recognized dietary supplement, and to be concerned about why kratom is used is akin to asking why some people consume a vitamin C tablet; this should be a personal choice, and a liberty. Kratom's alkaloids are also well-tolerated. This has been demonstrated in the literature; although kratom's alkaloids bind to opioid receptors, kratom does not cause the respiratory depression and the harmful effects of traditional opioids. Babu, McCurdy, and Boyer state: \"Although mitragynines agonize mu-opioid receptors, respiratory \ndepression, coma, pulmonary edema and death have not, to our knowledge, \nbeen associated with human kratom ingestion\" (Babu, McCurdy & Boyer,\n2008). Ward and colleagues write: \"Adverse effects from kratom are\nlimited. Kratom use does not appear to be associated with the emesis\nthat commonly accompanies opioid use. Interestingly, respiratory\ndepression following kratom administration has not been observed\" (Ward,\nRosenbaum, Hernon, McCurdy & Boyer, 2011). De Moraes and others state:\n\"In addition, MIT [mitragynine]causes much less \nrespiratory depression and does not produce emesis or dyspnea when \ncompared to other opioids\" (De Maoraes, Moretti, Furr, McCurdy &\nLanchote, 2009). The DEA claims that deaths have resulted in kratom ingestion, yet it cannot provide an instance in which kratom was the only contributing factor. All the deaths and adverse health reactions that are claimed to be from kratom alone have been the result of poly-drug intoxication. For instance, an article entitled \"Seizure and Coma\nFollowing Kratom (Mitragynina speciosa Korth) Exposure\" (Nelsen et al.,\n2010) states the following: \"[The] patient had ingested a tea made with kratom and Datura\nstramonium.\" Furthermore: \"Urine drug screening was positive for cannabinoids, tricyclic antidepressants, and oxycodone.\" Just because kratom's alkaloids were found in the blood of deceased or ill subjects is not a reason to claim that kratom alone was responsible.\n\nPlacing kratom's alkaloids into schedule I will have many consequences. Research into safer alternatives to traditional opioid medications will be severely hampered. People who rely on kratom for a better quality of life will no longer be able to obtain it legally. People who use kratom to manage debilitating health conditions and chronic pain will endure needless suffering. Folks who use kratom to manage opioid addiction will go back to more dangerous substances. American citizens who want nothing more than the liberty to use a safe and effective dietary supplement will be turned into felons. People who could have contributed to society will sit behind bars, not because they were violent, not because they harmed another person, but because they possessed a leaf from Southeast Asia; surely the legal system has more pressing priorities than this. Society will not benefit from outlawing kratom; the result will be a worsening opioid epidemic, restricted freedom, needless suffering, a higher burden on the legal system, and lack of research which could lead the way to safer medications. The DEA should be focusing on fentanyl analogues from China, the heroin which is of higher quality and cheaper than it ever has been, the lethal designer drugs and chemicals that are untested and unsafe; kratom has been used for thousands of years in Southeast Asia with no harm to those who choose to ingest it. Kratom is not harmful, and to ban it is a vastly misguided and gratuitous attempt at solving a problem; kratom is not the cause of this problem, in fact it holds the capacity to greatly benefit society in a myriad of ways.\n\n\nReferences:\nBabu, K.

I discovered Kratom three years ago. Five years ago I had a hernia surgery that has left me with chronic pain. I was prescribed Tramadol for pain. It worked good at first, but after a few months I had to take more and more to get relief. I was having such a bad reaction to the medication. I thought that I would have to live like this for the rest of my life. I was contemplating suicide until a co-worker recommended kratom. It works so well with my pain management. I find that kratom is a very safe herb and it has few side effects. I take three grams in the morning and three grams in the evening. I buy my kratom from MMMspeciosa. They are honest and the kratom they sell is all natural. My quality of life is so much better since I discovered kratom. If it is banned, I will probably die. I'm not being dramatic. Kratom works so well with my chronic pain management that it helps make life much more painless with minimal side effects.

It's similar to the coffee plant and has been used for thousands of years for pain, anxiety and depression.\n\nWhen ingested, naturally-forming plant alkaloids interact with receptors in human cells. Kratom acts on some of the same receptors that opioid-based drugs do, but it is not an opioid. Using this herb does not form the same dependent relationship with these receptors. In fact, it is known to block the receptor's \"need\" to bond with an Opiate, thereby reducing the symptoms of Opiate Withdrawal.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, kratom poses an emerging public health threat. The agency said there was a grand total of 660 calls to U.S. poison control centers about kratom in the last Six Years. Only One death was reported, a person who ingested antidepressant and anticonvulsant medications in addition to kratom. Compare that to the 28,000 deaths this year from heroin.\n\nAccording to the DEA website, Schedule I drugs have \"no currently accepted medical use\", they state this on their website here: https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml\n\nThe two compounds that the DEA is scheduling, are currently used in a commercial medicine called Tramasol:http://tramasol.com/howdoesitwork.html\n\nThis Supreme Court ruling cleary states that a substance may not be scheduled if the Secretary of Health and Human Services recommends that in not be:https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/osg/briefs/1990/01/01/sg900272.txt\n\nTherefore, I am contacting you to request that your agency recommend against scheduling these two chemical compounds.\n\nThe chemicals don't fit the requirements of a Schedule I drug, not only because it's currently used in a commercial medicine, but extensive medical use testing has been done on the alkaloids found in Kratom and has been proven to be effective for a variety uses: http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220090221623%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20090221623&RS=DN/20090221623\n\nKratom can help with detox from dangerous opiates like heroin. It's helped many people in our small community already. We in Massachusetts have a real problem right now with addiction and overdose. The ban on kratom will raise those numbers by taking away the one thing that is helping people overcome a dangerous addiction.\nI am a responsible adult consumer of Kratom. I use it to help with pain after being diagnosed with lyme disease in 2005. The pain from that disease has wreaked havoc on my body. With other diagnosis of fibromyalgia, hyperthyroid, fatigue, multiple food allergies, hair loss, and anxiety to follow.\nI was on many pain medicines until my doctor wrote me off label for suboxone for the pain. I used suboxone for eight years, until further testing of my liver found it was close to failure. I then had to make a decision. One that was so hard to do. The withdrawal from suboxone was worse than the opiate. But now I am so grateful because of kratom. I can run our family business, spend time with my kids and volunteer in the community again. With no adverse side effects. I have been an avid user of kratom now for 3 years. Kratom has saved not just my life but my families life by easing the joint pain, anxiety, and exaughstion so I can be there for them and a community that counts on me as a neighborhood volunteer.\n\nAgain, I request that your agency recommend against scheduling these two chemical compounds.\n\nI truly appreciate your time in this matter.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nLissa London \n\nMartha's Vineyard, Ma\n\n\n\nHere is some more information:\nhttp://www.americankratom.org/\nThe American Kratom Association is a consumer group.

Crack does. Heroin does. Other dangerous substances do. Kratom does not. I have a wife who suffers from chronic long term pain. Kratom is vastly preferable to highly addictive opiate pharmaceuticals. My wife was hit by a drunk driver when she was six years old. She was burned on over 50% of her body. Third degree and worse. She suffers from back pain to this day. I have seen the difference firsthand between pharmaceuticals and kratom. There is no comparison. Pharmaceuticals are incredibly addictive, kratom is not even on the same playing field of addictiveness as hydrocodone. \n\nMy cousins life is controlled by heroin. I have seen firsthand the horror of that drug. Kratom is something that has much to offer society and individuals whose lives have been destroyed. People turn to crime when they cannot get heroin - or to other pharmaceuticals which offer no help in the long run and which they cannot afford any more than heroin addiction.\n\nPeople can stop taking Kratom. I believe people can switch from heavily addictive substances to Kratom and then it is far easier for them to stop. For many of those people it is impossible to stop taking pharmaceuticals or heroin on there own. But this gives them a path to a better life that they can afford and it would be a mistake to take that away from them. Kratom should not be illegal. It makes no sense.\n\nThe DEA is a good agency. The work it does must be incredibly difficult. But please believe me when I say that prohibiting Kratom is not good. It is simply wrong. Thank you for listening to my opinion if you read this. I hope you have a good day.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-23159","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-13T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Danny Gurganus","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not take kratom from us.

KRATOM IS NOT A DANGEROUS DRUG.  I am 59 years old and I have been using kratom everyday for OVER 3 years now. I take kratom for my back pain (I have 2 compression fractures of the spine) and for my osteoarthritis AND IT DEFINITELY HELPS. I also take kratom for my severe anxiety and depression and sleep problems AND IT DEFINITELY HELPS. I also should mention that I do NOT take any RX or OTC drugs -- NONE. And, I do NOT drink alcohol.\n\nI do NOT take kratom to get high. Kratom does NOT get me high no matter how much I take. Kratom is not addicting like heroin, it's much closer to a coffee addiction which I can easily deal with [IF] I have to. We all are addicted to something, be it coffee, sugar, wheat, cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, gambling or fast food. The fact is... too much of anything can be bad for you and could lead to an addiction.\n\nToo much of anything can also be dangerous, for example, a person can die from drinking too much water, but the fact is nobody has died [specifically] from taking too much kratom ALONE. I do NOT crave more and more kratom even after daily use for 3+ years -- I always take the same amount everyday.\n\nOn August 31st the DEA irresponsibly placed the active compounds in Kratom , Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine, into Schedule I, effective September 30. As a taxpaying citizen who has elected you to office, I ask that you represent my voice and please act immediately to halt the DEAs irresponsible action to place Kratom on the list of Schedule I drugs.\n\nWhy not just regulate kratom in the same way you regulate alcohol, cigarettes and E-cigarettes which are definitely more of a health problem than kratom. The industry needs to come together to self-regulate and self-police one another and get rid of some of the bad apples out there.\n\nI support placing an age restriction on kratom for consumers who are 18 or older. I also believe that stricter labeling guidelines are necessary. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding shouldnt use kratom, for example, and anyone with a medical condition or who is taking prescription medications should consult their doctor before trying kratom. Perhaps most importantly, make sure that products arent being deliberately marketed toward younger consumers, or with the intent of comparing its effects to other drugs, like actual opiates.\n\nKratom is a tropical plant in the coffee family from Southeast Asia that has been used to support energy and focus, as well as a potent immune system booster.  Kratom is inherently safe and shares many therapeutic constituents in common with other widely recognized medicinal plants such as Cats Claw and Yohimbe, which currently enjoy wide spread safe usage as dietary supplements in the United States and abroad.\n\nThe DEA, without a serious review of the available scientific literature, has chosen to emergency schedule Kratom and designate it as schedule I substance; one that has no accepted medical value. The common citizen can easily perform a search for Mitragyna speciosa in Google scholar and find over 1,660 search results documenting the potential medical value of Kratom.  The DEA has not only turned a blind eye to the scientific literature, but it has also taken the stance that it is uninterested in hearing testimony from Kratom users who use it for its therapeutic value.  Thus, the DEA considers any and all use of Kratom to be abuse, while ignoring the medical literature, NIH funded studies, numerous patents, and millions of users testimonies, all of which point to its therapeutic potential.\n\nRather than consider the therapeutic potential for Kratom, the DEA has unilaterally moved to make millions of felons out of Kratom users who are simply using Kratom in accordance with its historical use, its patented use, and the conclusions of thousands of scientific studies. Allowing the DEA to unilaterally criminalize the use of Kratom will not only create millions of felons out of otherwise law abiding citizens, but it will also halt all scientific investigations into Kratoms medicinal benefits which would benefit millions of other law abiding citizens.  With America currently suffering from an opiate epidemic and opiate related overdoses at an all-time high, a policy that prohibits the research of therapeutic compounds does not make sense.  \n\nFurthermore, the economic impact of the criminalization of Kratom will have unforeseen consequences due to the enforcement costs and public health costs associated with addiction such as emergency room visits due to substituting Rx medicines, petty theft to obtain said Rx medicines, etc.  Lastly, harsh penalties, such as a felony charge for possessing Kratom will not only be ineffective in preventing its use but it will also severely limit otherwise law abiding citizens future prospects, a challenge that can be permanently damaging to individuals, while costing US citizens tax revenue that can be better spent.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-9666","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"William Hoenigmann","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":2,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear DEA representative, \n\nI am a Veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard. In 2008 I was honorably discharged after four years and two months. I had decided to use my Post 911 G.I. Bill to pursue an advanced degree. A few years after starting my education at a local junior college, I was accepted to San Diego State University, majoring in business administration.\n\nWhile attending SDSU I decided to take a wakeboarding class. Wakeboarding is like snowboarding, but behind a boat on the water, and I had been wakeboarding for several years before I decided to take the course through SDSU. During the first class I had fallen in very unique accident that left had crushed my tibia plateau into five pieces. \n\nThe tibia plateau is the top of the tibia that connects with your knee joint. This joint is the main weight bearing joint in the human body, and I had nearly destroyed this joint beyond repair. Three years and four surgeries later, I had finally began to recover and walk with a cane, but I was still in considerable pain. \n\nAs you can imagine, I was provided with a variety of pain medication during these three years -- medications such as Oxycontin, Norco, Lyrica, Morphine, etc. Also as you can imagine, I became helplessly physically addicted to them because of how much of the medication I needed to take, and over this mutli-year period. \n\nI would become uncomfortably sick when I did not take these medications and it affected my work, personal relationships, and my marriage. I need to find an alternative. I asked the physicians who were treating me, and the directed me towards methadone or methadone substitutes, but in my research, these drugs could be equally as addictive. \n\nThat's why I started to research holistic options and came across Kratom. Reading through forums for hours on end, I read success story after success story, so I decided to give Kratom a try. My plan was to ween myself off the opioid medication over time and to use Kratom to curb the overwhelming withdrawal symptoms. The plan worked. \n\nOver several weeks, I was able to completely kick the opioid medication. But, taking Kratom became even more important that a means to avoid long-term legal opioid use. Kratom actually reduced my pain enough to the point where I can comfortably walk. It was a miracle that I found an organic and all-natural plant that could both help me completely get off hardcore pain killers, but also, this plant could provide enough pain relief that I've never have to go back on opioid pain medication again. \n\nI cried the first day I did not have to take pain killers. They would have ruined my life. Kratom was, and is, the solution. I take Kratom a few times a day and have never wanted for any kind of opioid painkiller since. \n\nI understand why the DEA wants to make Kratom illegal. Kratom has never had the chance to be truly studied to understand it's medical purposes. That is the core problem. Kratom has the chance to help solve the opioid epidemic if it remains legal. \n\nWhat I do not understand is how Kratom compares to other legal substances. Kratom is a close cousin to the coffee plant. Caffeine is addicting and a stimulate, but not illegal. Alcohol is addicting, a stimulant, and kills 88,000 people per year. Alcohol accounts for 31% of driving fatalities, yet it is not legal. Opioid painkillers killed 28,000 people in 2014, yet these medications remain legal. 38% of all prescription-related deaths were caused by benzodiazepines, but these medications are not illegal. \n\nI did read that Kratom has been related to 15 deaths between 2014 and 2016, but these deaths did not include just Kratom alone. In each of these cases there were multiple substances involved. \n\nAt this point in time, I do not agree with the DEA's prior assessment that Kratom is a dangerous substance. In fact, I have had exactly the opposite experience. I strongly believe medications such as Oxycontin, Norco, Morphine, Benzo's, and other prescription narcotic medications are the danger. Use of these narcotic medications can lead to a serious addiction and possibly death. Furthermore, the withdrawal from these medications can force substance abusers into considering Heroin as an alternative. \n\nKratom can be the solution. It is not the problem.\n\nKratom has helped me bounce back from a horrible accident -- an accident that has left me with a life-long painful disability. Kratom has helped me overcome and beat my addiction to opioid pain medications. I'm not sure where I'd be today with out it.\n\nToday my wife and I own a successful small business. We are tax payers. We are good citizens, We believe a Kratom ban will take away a life-changing natural alternative to hardcore prescription narcotics. \n\nThink about how the pharmaceutical companies will benefit. They have every intention of seeing Kratom deemed illegal to reap the profits. Please carefully consider your decision as it will affect many lives.\n\nRespectfully,\nGregg Anderson\nUSCG Veteran\nSmall Business Owner","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-7134","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gregg Anderson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am 52 years old and the Grandmother of three rambunctious and precious boys 9, 6 and 1!

You can imagine the amount of prescriptions I have had to be on daily!

Yet I couldn't function without something for the pain!  I felt like a failure as a Mamaw at times because I had a hard time even getting out of bed but more less getting outside with my grandsons!  I ended up on Fentanyl Patches and yes they helped but whereas they were supposed to last for 3 to 4 days I was only getting relief for about 36 hours!  Then someone mentioned Kratom Tea in one of my Fibromyalgia groups and I decided to do some research and the more I read the more I realized this might be the answer I was looking for!  So I ordered a sample and for days I kept looking at that sample not sure about trying it!  But then one night I was hurting so badly and nothing was helping so I made my Kratom tea and ( this is the memory that literally brings tears to my eyes no joke) within a few minutes my pain was literally at a level .....that those with Fibromyalgia will understand this ....but it was at a level that to me was as if my body had been given another chance at life!  It wasn't \"gone\" but it was \"gone\" to me! I hadn't been that pain free in years and without feeling dizzy , off , no rush or funny side effects!  I literally cried with the pure fascinated joy of wonder that I had even waited a few days to try this natural plant based tea!  I now only use the fentanyl Patches if I am going to be out where I can't make the tea or I just need that extra push for the pain and if the Patches were no longer prescribed at this point i would be ok!  I have my life back and my Grandsons have their Mamaw to make memories with again!

I have come here to leave a brief comment concerning Kratom and how it has helped my life, as well as others around me.\n\nI have been taking Kratom for about 2 years now and my life has been extremely fulfilling. After dealing with a lot of pain issues and battling addictions with prescription pain medications, I found Kratom and never looked back. This allows me to function pain free and go about my day to day life as a normal individual. I have seen people lose their lives to prescription pain killers, so finding this alternative was virtually life changing.\n\nI also have multiple friends that used this as a means to get off of those drugs, including heroin. They have turned to productive members of society, after it became questionable that they would ever be their normal selves again.\n\nWithout going into too much detail, I have ONLY seen Kratom have a positive impact on the loved ones around me. To see it be classified as a schedule 1 is beyond comprehension to me, and only seems like a means to help out big pharm companies. PLEASE, take into account the comments you receive here, and realize this is something that will better the lives of our community, rather than sending them down the path of the dangerous alternatives, of which we are given no other option until this point.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-11415","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Ben Schneider","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Kratom has benefitted me in many ways.

I didnt grow up in tje projects. My family was upper middle class just like all my friend's. We had nice cars and houses and money in our pockets. We got bored and my best friends are out of my reach because we started gettinf high on fridays and by 19 we were all jumping from prescription drugs to herion of unknown quality because nothing was working anymore.  One of my closet friends and boyfriend for several years picked up some herion and did the same amount he always did and dies because his drug dealer wanted to cut it with pheytnol. His mother called me screaming and I lost my mind . It resulted in a three day stay in a psych ward because MY first and best friend died and we fought the day before. His name was Darryl and he had every thing...his family... money...friends... love...but it didn't spare him...\nOur other best friend got so desperate to feed his habit he started making meth. After being brutally beaten he hidbin a hotel when he asked me to bring him some batteries from walmart....we got pulled over leaving the hotel...the police told me I would be charged with felonies...several of them if I didnt tell him where the backpack he dumped was...With one desperate look at my best friend...5 days after Darryl died..I pointed to a stairwell and they took him off to jail...he had already been caught once and the fumes off the meth cause a little girl in the room next door to have brain bleeding.. I'll never see him again. His name was  Jeffery and he had loving parents and good values and money...it didn't spare him.\nAfter that I got on subutex to try and get off the drugs...I had traded a demon for the devil...After my son was born in May, I decided that I wasn't going to give the \"monster\" named addiction and death have any reason to reach for my son id I could help it...I had never heard of kratom but before I found it, I always said I would die getting high because I couldn't take quitting...Kratom diesnt get me high but I don't have the back pain and other random pain that I had originally gotten lortabs for at 16...It doesnt make me want more and if I don't have it the only issue is back pain coming back...no withdrawl...\nI promise you overdose rates will go even higher without kratom and you will turn good people into criminals... by understanding and not taking kratom away you wilk find strong allies and friends in the community of people saved ny kratom","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-0151","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"alexandra Ashley","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Dear Ms/Sir:\n\nBanning kratom is not conducive to public health for these and other reasons:\n\n\tBanning kratom expands the war on drugs, while the public overwhelmingly supports ending it.\n\tIf kratom is added to any one of the five drug schedules, people who use it will be criminalized and locked up behind bars.\n\tKratom has been used safely by millions of people in the U.S. and evidence supports kratom's potential as a pain       reliever and opioid replacement.\n\tMany people struggling with opioid addiction have turned to kratom to help them cut back or quit, but now all promising scientific studies on kratom's role in opioid treatment could be immediately shut down.\n\tSide effects of kratom are minimal, and its withdrawal symptoms are weak and nearly inconsequential compared to the suffering of people trying to quit opioids.\n\tProhibiting kratom will worsen the country's problems of opioid addiction and overdose.\n\nThank you,\nGordon Parker III\n","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21642","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Gordon Paker III","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Please do not ban the use of kratom.

People have chosen Kratom in low doses because those addicting FDA approved prescriptions are not helping their pain and  has improved their quality of life.  The FDA states  \"We can't rely upon public opinion and anecdotal evidence. We have to rely upon science\". I disagree with the FDA statement.  Anecdotal evidence and relying on science especially the people with the chronic pain using Kratom, pain symptoms are alleviated, thus not using the addicting opium prescriptions. Regulations for Kratom could be no different than the current regulation of Pseudoephedrine.  Drivers license showing proof of 18 years old. The more regulations the FDA gets too involved in, the more the public will find other ways to obtain or invent other recreational treatments which Kratom incidents are relatively low in comparison to the addictive prescription opioids, Pseudoephedrine and Heroin recreational usage.

I am hearing about the deaths on the news more regularly nowadays since the regulations on medicines and supplements keep becoming stricter.  Personally, that is not my issue.  Should more research need to be done to find what the plant chemicals do and \n\n Also I am finding too much hype about drugs in the media.  There is too much and misuse of the words addiction and dependence.  They only appear to be used in certain contexts with negative connotations, though there are plenty of prescribed drugs and medicines that people are dependent upon, and cannot be taken off abruptly without potentially harmful consequences, from antidepressants to blood thinners.  People I can see, by reading comments about articles, are becoming increasingly aware of these smear campaigns and that much of it comes from corruption, greed, and fear mongering.  Enough is enough.  \nWe have our natural born rights, and it's to the point that when there's government involved, they're just there to impinge on those to one degree or another, turning good people into criminals overnight and ruining decent peoples' livelihoods, and as a taxpayer I don't care to support this activity.

I am a 45 year old man from Illinois.  Starting about 10 years ago, I was having really painful back problems where I would lift something heavy or turn the wrong way and my back would go out very painfully for 2 or 3 days.  It would get so bad that I would have to see a doctor, and they would usually give me a muscle relaxant and an opioid painkiller, usually Vicodin.  A few years into this pattern, I started working at a used furniture place moving furniture and was having very bad back problems, and I eventually got hooked on Vicodin or others painkillers like it.  Things got really bad for the next 6 or 7 years.  My addiction grew and grew as my tolerance built.  I'm sure there were times when I was so close to overdose that I shouldn't be alive today.  I was eventually referred to a Methadone clinic where I went regularly for about a year.  That was just another addiction that made me like a zombie and was even worse than the painkillers I was using it to get off of.  Then I did some research online and found Kratom.  The day it arrived in the mail was the last day I've done any opioids.  It might elevate the mood a bit, but doesn't get me high like the opioids or methadone.  I have been drug free ever since and my life has improved greatly.  I sitll pull my back out occasionally, but when I do, I avoid the ER and just take a few more Kratom capsules and I can handle the pain until it eases.  It has completely taken away my craving for opiods and even alcohol which I also suffered an addiction with.  I'm working, I went back to school and got a degree in Machining, and my life is so much better.  That's why I'm so worried about this upcoming ban.  I fear, like many others, that if you ban it, I will go back to opioid painkillers like Vicodin and be right back where I started.  I pray you reconsider and at least do some research.  This plant is a gift from God and could help so many people with the same troubles I had and will have again if it's banned. Thank you for your time,\nJohn L.

I started taking painpills at that time. In 2008 I had a full Hysterectomy. My doctor sent me home with enough oxycontin to last several months. After the 6 weeks were up I was supposed to stop using it, but everytime I tried to stop I would have withdrawals and depression. Taking the oxycontin made me forget all about my problems. Because of IC the doctor kept prescribing me oxycontin. I was also purchasing them illegally because I needed more than I was prescribed due to my tolerance going up. I was taking 120 to 180 miligrams of oxy per day. If I ran out I would suffer severe withdrawals. After 2 years I lost my job and my home, all I cared about was being high. I decided I had had enough.In December of 2010 I put myself in a treatment program and cold turkey got off of the opiates. They offered me Methadone, and Suboxine but I absolutely did not want anything to do with any more pills. My anxiety and depression were worse than ever, so my doctor prescribed Zoloft. I took it for 2 months and felt no difference so I stopped taking it. After being off of opiates for 4 months I discovered Kratom. I tried it a few times and I was finally able to get out of bed, my depression was managable and I was able to control the IC flare ups with my diet. I went back to work and started going to college.

This natural plant is just fine as an alternative health maintenance supplement.\n\nKratom in recent years helped me get my life back from a dependency to legally prescribed by my doctor, opioid/opiate pain medications (hydrocodone) for an injury that required two surgeries, ambien/zolpidem for my lifelong chronic insomnia, and  Xanax for withdrawal symptoms of hydrocodone and ambien....Xanax just made my dependency worse.\n\nI chose not to go to rehab or see mental health professionals under my right to refuse medical treatment.  This due to the public's associated unfair stigma of mental health and drug rehab.\n\nThat right also should give me the freedom to use any tool or alternative supplement I see fit to better myself.  No law says I can't self improve alternatively and no law should come about barring such freedom. \n\nKratom I feel helped save my life.  It saved my life from potentially overdosing on hydrocodone and ambien, and it saved my life due to the near fatal state the withdrawals put me through. Withdrawal lasted 9 months, and it was hell.  However, Kratom helped make it possible to actually survive the seizures, the emotional aspects, the physical illness, the cravings for the prescriptions, the stroke level blood pressure, the insomnia, the pain, and the insanity of withdrawal.  It made me productive where I could work, pay bills and become a responsible husband to my wife again.\n\nI successfully handled a serious withdrawal without rehab because I used extremely rigorous physical exercise, good diet, determination, and supplementation with Kratom.\nI would not be here to write this letter today if it were not for Kratom. I feel I would be another death statistic of our country's opioid epidemic.  I have seen many things with my eyes in my  previous years in law enforcement that I feel  Kratom could have played a role in helping people with.\n\nLast year in 2015 I became ill and inherited a health condition from my mother.  I have tested positive for Multiple Sclerosis.  Though need further testing and treatment for my illness are very harsh and also far too expensive for me to afford.\n\nThe symptoms of my new neurological condition are often very harsh physically and psychologically.  Kratom has helped me with the symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, extreme pain, optic nerve stress (visual impairment), cognitive ability, and reduced my heat intolerance due to my neurological disorder.\n\nYou might say that Kratom needs to be a drug if it helps with all this.  But I say absolutely not because I don't believe in drugs.  Neither does millions of other people.  I believe in treating myself when I possibly can.  I also believe in the right to self treat with any alternative herbal supplement I see fit that works and does not hurt me, which Kratom does not.  I do not feel any illicit effects from Kratom, nor do I get addicted when I use it.  I have stopped using Kratom very easily every time I was ready to with no withdrawal effects.\n\nKratom is quite sobering, not intoxicating.  The effects are very mild.  The only thing it might do that you would want to call elicit about it is that it gives me a positive attitude.  And there's no law against that either.  In fact this day in age there's not enough of that.\n\nI don't believe millions of peoples' testimony about Kratom is \"anecdotal evidence\", as there are just as many witnesses who can testify that it has helped their loved ones live again.  Also, you don't see heroin addicts, coke addicts, meth addicts and alcoholics on Capitol Hill petitioning and protesting to say that their heroin, coke, meth, and alcohol has saved their lives. They are saying that Kratom has given them their lives back from these horrible drugs.\n\nIf you take away Kratom, schedule Kratom, or turn Kratom into a dangerous drug, you will only be in the opinions of millions making matters worse.\n\nWe The People have the power help in the drug war and we can do our part more effectively with Kratom readily available.  Please let us do our part in this war on drugs and let us use whatever alternative herbal supplements we see fit to help GET OFF DRUGS.  Leave Kratom to us.  It is helping millions of people get off of heroin and other opiate/opioid substances, street drugs and pharmaceuticals, not becoming further addicts.\n\nKratom turned into a pharmaceutical will just be covering it with beuraucratic red tape, making it impossible for millions of people who need it to access it.  It will only end up being priced so high by the medical community that only certain income classes could have it.  This will only put millions at risk to the citizens of our country who need it the most.  Furthermore, outlawing/scheduling Kratom will be a disservice to this country.\n\nThank you for your time","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-3086","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Dustin Barr","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"Hi DEA\n\nMy name is Henrik Palmgren.

I work at a company that does outsourced jobs for the military, which I have had for 15 years.  I was on the verge of losing everything that was important to me in my life before I found Kratom.  I started taking opioid prescription pain medications for my fibromyalga.  I also suffer from major depression and anxiety and was on other prescription medications for those.  As with most people that take opiods they become less effective as time goes on.  I became addicted to the medication and I was hospitalized as a result of the withdrawal, which started to affect my job since I would miss so much work.  I was so unstable and moody from the pain and withdrawal that it was destroying my family.  I was on a mission to find something to help reduce my pain and improve my mood.  I researched on the internet and found Kratom.  I found this plant that is in the coffee family and is not in any way an opiate.  I started drinking it as a tea and found that it did not give me the high like an opioid but at the same time it reduced my cravings for opioids.  I have been off opioids for a year now.  I continued to drink Kratom because it helps to reduce my pain and It makes me feel like I can get out of bed and tackle the day with this overall happy and calm feeling.  I even feel more alert and energetic.  I'm still drinking it daily and I've never had any side effects or withdrawals.  I soon was back to my old self and able to be the husband and father that my family deserves.  This amazing plant has helped tons of people.  And with the current opiate epidemic in this country this plant should be embraced not banned.  At the very least it should be researched more.  I am grateful for the DEA stepping back and giving the public an opportunity to speak.  And I'm sure the evidence will prove this plant is safe and effective for many different things.

I graduated from Tulane Medical School in 1999 when the first disastrous effects of over-marketing Oxycontin and other Opioids were just beginning to be seen.  Today, as we know,78 people die daily in America from opioid addiction and 2/3rds of those death are due to prescription opioids. The group most at risk of death are middle aged women taking their opioids as prescribed, usually in  escalating doses because tolerance and painful daily withdrawal require ever larger doses. The mythology that daily opioids are a safe, effective and function restoring medication is fully disproved by the data from 1996 to present (when this lethal experiment began). The data shows that escalating opioid prescription was accompanied by escalating pain rates, disability rates, overdose death, heroin use, and addiction rates. We now have the greatest healthcare disaster in the history of America. Alongside this, the war on drugs started in the 1980's has led to mass incarceration rates that rival any other country and have devastated the lives of millions of citizens whose only crime in some cases was to possess a small amount marijuana. This has cost us a fortune and availed no higher cause. Intriguingly, the legalization of marijuana in some states has led to lesser use of opioids, benzodiazepines and anti-psychotics among Medicare patients in those states.\n\nKratom too has the potential to help patients suffering with pain and opioid addiction. The stories that are told are compelling and should be heard. Over as 5 year period only 50 patients have been seen in poison control centers across the US for problems related to this drug. In most cases other drugs were involved and no one died. Compare this to 78 deaths per day from opioids. Opioids are the threat, not Kratom. We should explore the potential of this tool to help those suffering from iatrogenic and accidental addiction. We should observe and listen. If it appears that addiction or other issues seem to be occurring due to Kratom then we should treat these medical problems with compassion, rather than stigmatizing and jailing people.  Criminalization of drug use and addiction has proven a massive debacle. We should learn from our mistakes and start more drug wars. We can't afford it, it is not the compassionate thing to do and we surely should not deny patients access to what looks to be a safe alternative for treating pain and addiction.

She has had issues with opiate painkillers in the past, and has done her best to avoid them. Kratom is the only natural supplement she has found that helps to ease her daily pain, and she is very concerned that if the ban goes through, she will have no other choice than to return to opiate painkillers.\n\nPlease do not ban this plant, it's not a recreational substance being abused, it is helping mothers like mine with pain and helping others with opiate withdrawals or addiction.

This plant has helped millions of people including myself-- deal with pain, anxiety, RLS, and depression as well as other health concerns. The action proposed by the DEA  would essentially  put  kratom on the same level as illegal drugs, comparing it to  heroin . Kratom is a health supplement , not a drug!. This proposed action by the DEA  would  prevent further research, which  has already shown kratom to be beneficial -WITHOUT causing harm such as respiratory depression;  which is the main cause of death from opiate overdose. This is Vital Information, as anecdotal evidence also shows that kratom has been shown to help with withdrawal symptoms from opioid use and abuse of both legal and illegal opiates, such as heroin and prescription drugs. Essentially that means Kratom can potentially help end the opioid overdose and death issue so prevalent in our country.\n\nIn  our neighbor to the north, Canada- Kratom is considered simply a regulated dietary ingredient. Perhaps that is  what is necessary in the US . However Kratom is absolutely not a drug. Kratom is no more addictive than coffee. \nConsider the multiple deaths and health problems caused buy alcohol use and abuse, nicotine use and abuse, and even caffeine overdoses. Kratom does NOT have these health issues. Rather it is a supplement which has beneficial uses. Please do not stop research and responsible use of this natural botanical.\n\nI personally  started using kratom approximately 3 years ago in order to wean myself from the prescription drug Tramadol. I was addicted to it for over 20 years and attempted several times to stop taking it without success because of the horrible withdrawals. Once I discovered Kratom I was able to end my horrible addiction to that medication within 3 weeks. Additionally I have found it to be extremely useful to deal with a painful back injury and a severely sprained ankle. It has proven to be much more effective as an analgesic than any medication I had tried prior. And I was able to avoid taking any prescription medication and therefore avoided dealing with potential opioid addiction. I truly think that more research and of course keeping kratom accessible can only save lives. I believe it saved mine..","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-13733","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Anonymous Anonymous","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"I am writing to ask you to keep Kratom legal and available.

As a working physicist, I would not be able to do my job effectively under the effects of opioid painkillers; unfortunately there are days when I cannot work due to pain issues, and non-opioid painkillers are insufficient on all but the best of days.  I do not use illegal drugs and have not taken opiates since I was prescribed them years ago while recovering from surgery; even then, they did not alleviate my back and leg pain, and I would hesitate to risk the side effects and addiction possibilities even if they did.\n\nMy experience with kratom has been limited, but so far it is entirely positive.  My quality of life and my job performance have improved significantly due to the reduction in pain, without the opioid 'high', now that I have found a suitable dose.  \n\nI cannot speak for others on this matter, but I have had a colleague perform a blinded test on me to ensure that the placebo effect did not account for all of the benefits - kratom works for me.  Until more is known or a replacement is found I strongly believe that kratom should remain available.\n\nI thank you for your consideration.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-21646","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Jef Broll","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"If you're all fired up to ban anything, ban the AMA's moratorium on cures in lieu of treatment is more profitable.

I have lived in severe pain for the past thirty years.  In 2014 I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and prescribed about ten different pharmaceutical medications.  It got to the point that I had to wear a fentanyl patch and it still wasn't controlling my pain.  Depression and anxiety on top of the chronic pain took it's toll on me and I attempted suicide in August of 2014.  Since that time I have been trying to get my life together and a year ago I discovered Kratom in a chronic pain support group online.  I thoroughly researched it and decided I would try taking Kratom.  It immediately changed my life!  I no longer take any prescribed medications and I am living life again instead of avoiding it!  My depression and anxiety are under control.  My children have their mother back.  I am able to work without pain for the first time in thirty years!  Kratom has changed my whole outlook on life and I would be devastated if it were to become illegal.  Please consider all of the people that Kratom has helped and how many will be hurt if it is taken away.  Please consider all of the lives this plant has helped to save and will continue to save.  Please also consider the opiate epidemic in this country and the fact that many, many people are able to get off of these dangerous narcotics with the help of this plant.  If Kratom were made illegal, myself and many thousands of other people would be adversely affected.","docketId":"DEA-2016-0015","docketTitle":"Schedules of Controlled Substances:  Temporary Placement of Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine into Schedule I","docketType":"Rulemaking","documentId":"DEA-2016-0015-15900","documentStatus":"Posted","documentType":"Public Submission","numberOfCommentsReceived":1,"openForComment":false,"postedDate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00-05:00","rin":"Not Assigned","submitterName":"Debbie Nelson","title":"Comment on FR Doc # 2016-24659"},{"agencyAcronym":"DEA","allowLateComment":false,"attachmentCount":0,"commentDueDate":"2016-12-01T23:59:59-05:00","commentStartDate":"2016-10-13T00:00:00-04:00","commentText":"To whom this may concern,\nIt is important to realize plants that individual can grow and use to help aid in the healing of oneself, should not ever be outlawed.
